1
00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:04,704
<i>It all started when a time travel
experiment I was conducting... </i>

2
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:07,706
<i>went... a little caca. </i>

3
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:11,266
<i>In the blink of a cosmic clock,
I went from quantum physicist</i>

4
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:14,712
<i>to air force test pilot, </i>

5
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:17,511
<i>which could have been
fun if I knew how to fly. </i>

6
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:20,849
<i>Fortunately, I had help,
an observer from the project named Al. </i>

7
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:24,948
<i>Unfortunately, Al's a hologram,
so all he can lend is moral support. </i>

8
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:28,017
<i>Anyway, here I am,
bouncing around in time, </i>

9
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:30,188
<i>putting things right
that once went wrong, </i>

10
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:34,131
<i>a sort of time-traveling Lone Ranger
with Al as my Tonto, </i>

11
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,726
<i>and I don't even need a mask. </i>

12
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:39,672
Oh, boy.

13
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:01,649
<i> You know, this leaping about
in time has its advantages. </i>

14
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:05,590
<i>Like being able to reunite
the love of my life with her father. </i>

15
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:10,153
<i>And even though I wasn't supposed to
affect anyone in my personal future, </i>

16
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,562
<i>I figured the big guy upstairs
would understand. </i>

17
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,631
<i>Then again, maybe he didn't. </i>

18
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:26,270
Get up. ! Get up,
Kid. ! One, two, three...

19
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:31,181
- Get up! Up!
- four, five, six,

20
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:34,778
Get up. ! Up. !
seven, eight, nine

21
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:38,518
- That's it. That's it.
- You okay, Kid?

22
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:40,355
Come on.

23
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,299
Come on. Stop it. Knock it off. Come on. Stop it.

24
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:59,504
Get back.

25
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:06,611
Go to a neutral corner. One, two...

26
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,483
Sorry, I...
Go to a neutral corner.

27
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:10,989
Three, four, five,

28
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:14,493
six, seven, eight, nine...

29
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:18,395
You're out. The winner.

30
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:27,699
<i> How about a statement?
Turn this way, would ya?</i>

31
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:31,437
Hey, everybody outta here.
Give the Kid some air.

32
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,969
Chalky, get them outta here. You're
fighting Tiger Joe Jackson in a week or two,

33
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,073
Out! Out! Chalky, have a heart come on.

34
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:43,782
<i>Kid, Kid, we need one statement for
the press. He'll talk to you later. </i>

35
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:46,223
<i>Now, come on. Give us a break here</i>

36
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:56,659
What happened?
You almost lost our last fight together, Kid.

37
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:09,271
Hold still. You know, I hardly
touched him with that punch.

38
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:13,509
Funny how fast
he went down.

39
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:19,014
You okay, Kid? You know
where you are and everything?

40
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,492
Why wouldn't I know
where I am?

41
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:25,554
Well, uh,
he hit you pretty good.

42
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:29,124
- Too good, if you ask me.
- What do you mean "too good?"

43
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,401
Hit the shower, Kid.

44
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:44,806
- You're right on time.
- Promptness is a virtue. Congrat...

45
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:50,379
Congratulations on your victory
this evening, Mr. Cody.

46
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:54,689
That surprise punch
in the last inning- it was inspired.

47
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:57,889
"The last inning. "
Real good.

48
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,558
Your owners are
a lot of laughs, Cody.

49
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,899
You sure Duke Ludden
left Cody to you?

50
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,599
It was legally determined that he left
some of his estate to Saint Mary's Church,

51
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:10,268
including Mr. Cody's contract.

52
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:15,781
What about my, uh, guys?

53
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:18,511
You kidding? Them nuns
is poor as church mice.

54
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:21,076
We'll have that last be
another time. Okay?

55
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,793
Uh...

56
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:32,028
Um, I suppose things are happening
rather abruptly for you.

57
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:36,364
Uh, well, I'm getting used to it.

58
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:46,709
This is the north wall where
the stained glass window will go.

59
00:05:54,220 --> 00:06:00,056
The poor box here. Uh, that section over there
is for feeding and shelter for the homeless.

60
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:04,654
And, finally, this area here...

61
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:09,293
The main chapel area, open
to the poor 24 hours a day.

62
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:13,533
That way, God's available
to anyone at any time.

63
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:16,268
Oh, it'll be so beautiful.

64
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:21,246
Just imagine the sun streaming
through the stained glass window...

65
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:24,010
blues and golds and reds.

66
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:28,145
And the polished cherry wood of the pews
and the golden tassels on the hymnals.

67
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:32,055
- Can't you see it?
- But what's this got to do with me?

68
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,958
You're providing it.
After all these years of prayer,

69
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:37,360
all we need now is for you
to win your next prizefight.

70
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:42,595
Uh, Sister, um, I'm, uh...
I'm not too good.

71
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:49,667
Don't be so modest, Cody. You won your
last 10 fights. All by a knockdown.

72
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:54,146
Just... Just...

73
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:56,375
don't count on me too much.

74
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:02,717
I am counting on you. So are all
the other sisters at Saint Mary's.

75
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:06,281
Cody, you are going to beat
Tiger Joe Jackson...

76
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,919
and become the next
California Heavyweight Champion.

77
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:11,259
Then we'll have enough money
to start our chapel.

78
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:15,028
Sister Angela, I would strongly
suggest that you hedge your bet.

79
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,628
Have faith, Cody. It's all going
according to God's plan.

80
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:21,469
Yeah, but is God going
according to Ziggy's plan?

81
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:26,706
He figured this leap would land you
in Texas, somewhere in the mid-'50s.

82
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,113
- Oh, great.
- That's the spirit.

83
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:34,643
Now, um, until you win,
we're going to be scarce on funds,

84
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:37,790
so, we'd really appreciate it
if you could move in with us

85
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,818
to save us on food and housing expenses.

86
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:42,293
Sounds better than rent control.

87
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:46,795
Uh, well...
It's done then.

88
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,801
Why don't you go get your things, and
I'll meet you back at Saint Mary's.

89
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:52,463
Have faith, Kid Cody.

90
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,924
You know, I have a feeling
that between you and I

91
00:07:56,925 --> 00:07:59,771
and a couple of guardian angels,
we're gonna get this job done.

92
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:08,514
- Who, who does she remind you of?
- Ingrid Bergman.

93
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:13,957
No. You.

94
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:19,021
You and me both back in the old days when we were
trying to raise funding for the imaging chamber.

95
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:24,093
We were poring over the blueprints
and that was our dream, you know?

96
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:29,335
Our chapel. Remember? Nah, you don't
- you don't remember.

97
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:32,810
Oh, this is... Look at this.

98
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,370
"Sacramento, California".
Yuck.

99
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:40,545
1974. Tell Ziggy that's a long way
from Texas in the '50s.

100
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,886
Well, Ziggy figures it's just
an unscheduled stop.

101
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,189
Well, in case you and Ziggy haven't
noticed, they're all unscheduled stops.

102
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:51,719
The only thing I'm scheduled to do here
is to get my brains knocked out.

103
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:55,063
- Don't fight.
- What if that's what I'm supposed to do?

104
00:08:55,135 --> 00:09:00,971
What if I'm here to win the championship
so Sister Angela can get her chapel?

105
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,477
Well, then, uh...
You're in big trouble, Sam.

106
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:13,709
Al?
Am I boring you, Al?

107
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,486
I just...

108
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,459
I got this nut for a
neighbor who sleeps all day,

109
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:24,292
and then at night he's rebuilding
the engine on his car.

110
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:27,690
From 2:00 am, all I hear
is vroom, vroom... vroom.

111
00:09:27,691 --> 00:09:29,234
Okay, that's fine.
Al...

112
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:34,138
He's got more holes in his
muffler than you've got in your memory.

113
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:39,668
I complain, uh, this guy...
Oh, yeah, and he's a big guy.

114
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:44,115
Tells me to blow it out my tailpipe.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

115
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,125
Hey, Kid?
Hey, Kid.

116
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:59,859
Mr. Edwards wants to see you... now.

117
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:03,435
Come on.

118
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:21,410
What the hell were you doing in
that ring today, Kid? Nothing.

119
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:24,149
That's what it looked like,
nothing.

120
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:27,716
I won, didn't I?
That's good.

121
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:31,093
That really is good. I didn't
know you had a sense of humor, Kid.

122
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:34,088
Well, I, you know, I've been
known to tell a joke or...

123
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:34,964
Turn it up.

124
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:37,594
<i>In an attempt to become
the second man in history... </i>

125
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,663
<i>to regain the World
Heavyweight Championship... </i>

126
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:46,269
<i>The 32-year-old Ali will fight 25-year-old
George Foreman in a 15-round bout with... </i>

127
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:48,507
I put a couple of bucks
of my own on that one.

128
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:51,482
Not as much as I'm gonna be
betting on your championship.

129
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:54,213
I'm-I'm not sure that I'd do that.

130
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:58,880
What are you trying to
tell me, Kid?

131
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,291
Well, I...

132
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:05,354
I've been thinking about retiring.

133
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:08,525
You know, I don't wanna end up...

134
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,535
Like, like...

135
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:16,405
"Charley, I could been a contender,
instead of a bum. "

136
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:18,637
Is that...

137
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:22,340
Quitting right now
would be a bad idea.

138
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:29,253
Look, come on. You would- You-You'd-You'd
kill a guy 'cause he wants to quit?

139
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:31,347
No, I don't kill people.
What do you think I am?

140
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:34,450
We blow off your kneecaps,

141
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,394
give you a little, wooden board with roller
skate wheels for the rest of your life.

142
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:42,457
You know, I think you're right.

143
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,868
I think... I think quitting
would just probably be a bad idea.

144
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:47,838
Besides, I never could skate.

145
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:52,241
What'd you think? I was gonna set you
up for 10 fights, let you retire now?

146
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:59,679
You're gonna go
in the tank with Tiger Joe.

147
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:02,915
I'll tell you the round later.
Now get outta here.

148
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:06,823
Here.
Here's your money.

149
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:18,370
Hope you know what you're doing.

150
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:36,719
Great. I'm on the take,
wear polyester clothes...

151
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:42,284
and live above a bar in
an apartment decorated like a gym.

152
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:45,820
If I've got a roommate,
he probably has cauliflower ears.

153
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:49,061
- Hello.
- Hi, honey.

154
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:56,172
Oh. Honey, I'm sorry
I didn't get to see the fight.

155
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:58,403
The creep I work for
wouldn't let me off early.

156
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:02,141
A bunch of soldiers came in, and he
made me dance an extra 45 minutes.

157
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:04,809
Are you hungry?
I made your favorite for dinner tonight.

158
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:06,818
My favorite?
Mm-hmm.

159
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:10,151
Oh, thanks.
I really like my favorite.

160
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:14,455
It's my...
It's... It's one of my favorites.

161
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:19,191
I see Mr. Edwards came through. I'm gonna
put it in our secret "hidey-hole, " okay?

162
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:22,428
Okay. Oh.

163
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:32,670
Soldiers tipped pretty good today.

164
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:39,079
Looks like we're
ready for that rainy day.

165
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:43,612
Are you serious? We're gonna need
about $20,000 for that doughnut shop.

166
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:45,657
You can't go on
fighting forever, Kid.

167
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:50,389
And I certainly can't go on being a topless
go-go dancer for the rest of my life.

168
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,454
The mountains are starting to
come to Muhammad, you know?

169
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:54,693
Well, I-I, uh...

170
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:58,430
You look great to me.
Mmm.

171
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,871
I love you, Cody.

172
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:08,107
You're the first man who's ever trusted
me with his money and his future.

173
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:19,384
Oh.

174
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:23,489
- It's Roscoe.
- Roscoe.

175
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:26,361
Damn it, Cody.
You promised.

176
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:29,890
<i>Hey, it's only three "C" notes, Dixie.
It's not so much. </i>

177
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:33,063
If that nag had come in, I'd be
paying you guys eight grand right now.

178
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:37,303
Honey, did you try to get it all at once? Well.

179
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:42,312
Honey, you know the quick way
never works.

180
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,349
<i>Come on, Kid.
You can't welsh on a bet. </i>

181
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:50,378
He's right. We might as well pay him,
otherwise he'll just wind up beating you up.

182
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:53,482
I'll get it.

183
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:01,384
Roscoe,
you come between us and a jelly-filled,

184
00:15:01,385 --> 00:15:03,994
sugar-glazed and sprinkles
on top one more time...

185
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,664
and I'll bust your nose!

186
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:11,905
<i>Oh. ! Damn it.
Oh, you broke my nose. </i>

187
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:14,538
You want a beer?

188
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:18,880
Um, I don't have time.

189
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:22,284
What do you mean
you don't have time?

190
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:25,483
Well, my contract was inherited-

191
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:27,389
I know.
By the nuns. So?

192
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:32,955
Well, they want me to move in to Saint
Mary's and train for the championship.

193
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:39,962
You know, to save money. You'd rather
go live with the nuns than with me?

194
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:49,176
I... I don't know what to say, Dixie.
Um, I...

195
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:57,346
They own me.
Well, honey, I thought I owned you.

196
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,729
And you owned me.

197
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:11,293
<i>Amazing grace</i>

198
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:16,967
<i>How sweet the sound</i>

199
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:22,879
<i>That saved a wretch</i>

200
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:28,444
<i>Like me</i>

201
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:33,754
<i>I once was lost</i>

202
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:39,831
<i>But now I'm found</i>

203
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:46,336
<i>Was grace that taught</i>

204
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:51,166
<i>My heart to fear</i>

205
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:54,440
<i>And grace</i>

206
00:16:54,513 --> 00:17:00,008
<i>My fears relieved</i>

207
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:08,357
How precious did

208
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:14,093
That grace appear

209
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:19,399
The hour I first...

210
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:24,808
<i>Believed</i>

211
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:32,951
<i>Through many dangers</i>

212
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,785
Al?

213
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:42,260
- Al?
- Denise. Denise, get in the closet.

214
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:49,527
Oh, no, there's
no other girl here, Tina.

215
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:53,436
I swear, honey.
No, don't, Tina.

216
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:55,440
Tina?

217
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:01,502
- Oh, hi, Kid.
- Hi, Al.

218
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,744
You know, people with monogamous relationships
don't wake up with guilty consciences.

219
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:07,979
I know.
They don't have any fun either.

220
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:12,955
Anyway, the problem
is not Denise.

221
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:18,019
The problem is
the muffler from hell.

222
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:23,535
This guy is driving me nuts with
his vroom, vroom, vroom all night.

223
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,968
Denise? Yeah, she's a writer.

224
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:29,132
Uh, she's gonna write
my life story.

225
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:33,372
A writer?
What's she written?

226
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,643
Uh, I don't know.
I met her at a party.

227
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:39,708
She's got the most incredible
pair of...

228
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,515
Al. Al, you're in a church.

229
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:46,251
Oh. Of, uh, matching
boxing gloves.

230
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:53,122
What'd Ziggy come up with? He says there's
not enough data on this guy next door...

231
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:56,191
to do me a damn bit of good.

232
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,702
Oh, so-sorry. You meant you? Yeah.

233
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:00,636
Yeah, you.
Mm-hmm.

234
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:05,507
Well, Ziggy thinks that
given all the unknown variables here,

235
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:10,311
that your winning the championship and
getting the chapel for the good sisters...

236
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:13,647
is your best shot at quantum leaping-
What unknown variables?

237
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:17,177
Well, if we knew the unknown,

238
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:20,157
the unknown wouldn't be unknown.

239
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:23,992
Let me give you
a few known variables, Al.

240
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:25,997
I don't know how to fight.
I'm out of shape.

241
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:29,432
I've got a nun for a trainer.
Yeah.

242
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,993
I can fix that.
How?

243
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:34,699
I'll train you myself.
Put 'em up.

244
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:37,607
No offense, Al, but I need a
real trainer, not a hologram.

245
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,906
What are you talking about?
Put 'em up.

246
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:45,417
Hey, when I was 16, back in the
days when the dinosaurs ruled the planet,

247
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:49,978
I was the Golden Gloves
regional champ.

248
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:52,785
Come on. Put 'em up.
I'll train you myself. Come on.

249
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:56,851
Who could train you better
than me? Put 'em up. You?

250
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,487
Yeah.
Hit my hand.

251
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:07,036
Okay.
I'll get you a sparring partner.

252
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:10,098
- All right?
- It's not gonna work, Al.

253
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:14,169
What do you mean it's not... Hey, come on.
Give it a chance, for crying out loud.

254
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:17,079
Where you going?
To get a real trainer.

255
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:22,080
What do you mean,
"a real trainer"?

256
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:25,487
Hey, who taught you
everything you know?

257
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,437
I was good too.

258
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,025
Oop!

259
00:21:05,396 --> 00:21:07,065
Here's your T. K. O. , Kid.

260
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:34,283
Next time... next time, uh,
let it breathe a little.

261
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,103
Why won't you train me?

262
00:21:43,104 --> 00:21:46,762
I'm tired of training fighters who take dives.

263
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:50,468
Well, what if I don't take a dive?
What if this time...

264
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:54,842
What if this time?
That's the booze talking.

265
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:59,408
No, it's...
No, it's me talking.

266
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:02,977
If you come back,
I'll give it everything I got.

267
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:09,391
That's what I like to see,
a fighter in training.

268
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:12,953
Hey, bring us another round
for my guys.

269
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:16,433
Gotta keep 'em sharp
for the championship.

270
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:20,063
Hey, Kid,
you listen to him.

271
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:24,132
Yeah, this rumdum
was one of the best.

272
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:29,704
He could take a swan into the canvas
better than any other fighter I ever owned.

273
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:35,550
That last fight of yours- ooh-you
should got an Academy Award.

274
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:42,391
You mean that, Kid? Kid? Huh?

275
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:46,522
You mean that? I'll give it my best shot.

276
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:50,624
You got yourself a trainer.

277
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:58,671
A pro shouldn't spar
with an amateur.

278
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:01,212
Oh, Father Muldooney will love it.
He'll be talking about it for years.

279
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:07,545
Can you give me some instructions?
Yeah, don't trip on his beard.

280
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:10,281
Hi, honey!

281
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:20,060
Is it okay if I watch?

282
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:23,533
Uh, Dixie,
this is Sister Angela.

283
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:26,036
Sister Angela,
this is my Dixie.

284
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:28,005
How do you do?
Hi. Oh.

285
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,702
Cody, I think you have enough people
in your corner, huh? Are you ready?

286
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:34,541
Here you go.
Come on. There you go.

287
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:35,779
Okay.

288
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,542
Hit to the right.

289
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:46,090
I'm really excited to be
working with you, Mr. Gomez.

290
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,191
I've never done anything like this before.

291
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,723
Attaboy, left, left.

292
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,698
Get him!
Did you change the Kid's style?

293
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:01,297
Huh?
No. No.

294
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:06,240
In the breadbasket.
Right in the belly.

295
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:09,974
- Watch out.
- Come on, honey. Kill the bum.

296
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:12,984
Hit 'im! Hit 'im!

297
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:16,112
Kill the bum!

298
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:24,996
Honey, are you okay?
Are you all right?

299
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:26,895
- Is he dead? Say something.
- Honey?

300
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:29,729
Okay, watch out.
Everybody out of the way.

301
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:34,501
Get 'im up.

302
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:41,071
Is he all right?
Oh, I'm sorry, Kid.

303
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,979
I guess I just got in a lucky
punch. Give us some room.

304
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:54,756
- I know what's going on here, Kid.
- You do?

305
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:57,990
You haven't had
a straight fight in a year.

306
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:02,432
You're out of shape,
out of wind and out of luck.

307
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:06,904
You don't need a trainer.
You need a miracle.

308
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:14,536
Let's pick it up for another mile. Pick it up?

309
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:17,200
Gomez made me swear that I would
push you hard. Now, come on. Let's go.

310
00:26:17,276 --> 00:26:20,109
Give me a break, Sister.
Just five minutes.

311
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:23,910
How did you ever get to be a prize
fighter? Just kind of fell into it.

312
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:27,440
All right. Five minutes.

313
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:30,511
But we're gonna walk fast.

314
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:35,424
Deal. We're not gonna lose our chapel
because you were lax on your roadwork.

315
00:26:35,494 --> 00:26:39,157
Why's this chapel so important to you?

316
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:41,222
That should be obvious
by now, Cody.

317
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:46,434
Well, it seems to me
there's more to it than that.

318
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:52,775
It's a long story.
I got five minutes.

319
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,775
You have four minutes
and 32 seconds.

320
00:26:56,848 --> 00:27:01,785
I got four minutes and 32 seconds,
31, 30, 29...

321
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:03,787
All right. All right.

322
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,617
Well?

323
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:18,095
When I was a child, I, um...
I lived in a castle.

324
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,832
What?
A pretend castle.

325
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:24,069
It was actually
a tree house in the backyard.

326
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:30,078
My mother and my brother used to call
me a princess. I really felt like one.

327
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:33,777
And one night I went to sleep
dreaming all these sweet dreams,

328
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:37,515
and I woke up
coughing into the face of a fireman.

329
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:42,583
My mother and...

330
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,653
and my father
and both my little brothers were killed.

331
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,734
For some unknown reason,
I was spared.

332
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:58,365
So I was shuffled around for a while
from uncle to uncle and...

333
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:02,170
it seemed I was a princess
without a castle.

334
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,507
Um, some really bad things happened,

335
00:28:06,585 --> 00:28:11,045
and I ended up out on the street
doing whatever I could to survive.

336
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:18,355
I began to hate everybody.
Even myself- even God.

337
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:25,633
And then one night, I... I kind of stumbled
into this skid row chapel in San Francisco.

338
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,696
I was looking for a place to sleep,
and a nun found me and she took me in.

339
00:28:28,774 --> 00:28:31,265
And she... Well, maybe
she didn't save my life,

340
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:33,334
but she absolutely
saved my soul.

341
00:28:33,412 --> 00:28:37,075
She gave me new hope
and self-respect.

342
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:43,244
She even gave me
faith in God again.

343
00:28:43,322 --> 00:28:46,814
And I decided at that moment
that I would create a chapel someday...

344
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:51,886
in the most destitute part of the city
to help people like myself.

345
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:54,557
To make a memorial for my family.

346
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:56,498
Another castle.

347
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:05,532
Our time's up.

348
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,602
Come on.
Let's get back to work.

349
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,843
Pick up those bricks.
Okay.

350
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:18,380
She's trying to kill me.
Five more miles?

351
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:22,450
Lift up your knees.
What about mercy?

352
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,594
That's not bad, Kid.
Al.

353
00:29:57,662 --> 00:30:01,894
- What?
- Uh, I'm done.

354
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:04,993
Work on your timing.
I'll be with you in a minute.

355
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,004
Okay.
Come on.

356
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:14,011
Al, it's good to see you.
Where you been?

357
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:17,242
Mm... catching up
on my sleep.

358
00:30:19,084 --> 00:30:21,678
Looking pretty good, Sam.
You're trim, moving well.

359
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:25,348
Gomez is doing a good job.
Yeah, they both are.

360
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:28,621
Oh, um, Ziggy finally
came up with some data for you.

361
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:32,151
The fight. Did Cody win
the fight? He took a dive.

362
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,198
Are you sure?

363
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:39,966
Yes. October- when was it-
29, 1974.

364
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:44,839
"Kid Cody is knocked out by Tiger Joe Jackson
in one minute, 10 seconds of the first round. "

365
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:48,744
What about Sister Angela's chapel?
No. No chapel.

366
00:30:48,814 --> 00:30:53,615
"Today that vacant lot has got a,
uh, mini-mall with a tanning salon,

367
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:58,679
"a convenience store that's been
robbed five times already this year.

368
00:30:58,757 --> 00:31:02,488
A singles... only gym"...
She never got her castle.

369
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:05,724
No.
Wait a minute though.

370
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:09,790
All you're giving me is what happened then.
I'm here to change all that.

371
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,894
How? You gonna beat Tiger Joe
for the championship?

372
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:15,633
- Why not?
- I'll tell you why not.

373
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:19,199
You're holding your left too low, that's
why not. Get your left up and pop! Pop, pop!

374
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:23,646
Get on the balls of your feet. That's it.
Can't punch anybody flat-footed.

375
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:27,481
Th-That's what Gomez keeps telling me.

376
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:31,545
Well...
Uh, anything else you wanna know?

377
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:36,526
- You gonna make it to the fight?
- Uh, yeah.

378
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:38,688
Yeah, probably.

379
00:31:38,763 --> 00:31:43,427
It, you know... It depends on whether
I can do something to stop the...

380
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:46,767
The vroom-vrooming. You know,
Al, I've been thinking about that.

381
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:51,673
What if you taped it at night and then played
it back the next morning while he's sleeping?

382
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:56,613
That's a good idea.

383
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:59,172
Yeah.
Thanks, Sam.

384
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:03,215
Okay, Kid, let's go.

385
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:12,285
Come on. Jab.

386
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:18,914
<i>Richard Nixon, although
pardoned, has become</i>

387
00:32:18,915 --> 00:32:21,362
<i> the central figure in the
Watergate cover-up trial. </i>

388
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,989
<i>Being accused by both
prosecution and defense attorneys</i>

389
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,375
Hey, where's your T. K. O. ?

390
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:30,278
I'm in training. One beer a
night. Yeah. That's what I heard.

391
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:34,011
Link here says you're training hard
- like for real.

392
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,616
You aren't getting in
the habit, are you, Kid?

393
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:45,219
Those are lethal weapons.
You hit me. I can have you arrested.

394
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,288
No more jokes.

395
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:53,829
I'd rather see a fighter
turn rumdum than to get religion.

396
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:56,169
Ooh, hey, look.

397
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:01,237
It's a streaker.

398
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:06,717
Oh, I got a couple of dames
I'd like to see doing that.

399
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:09,310
Ah, now that's what it's all about.

400
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:17,090
A couple of guys ducking it out.
May the better man win.

401
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:24,762
You're gonna take your dive
in the first round.

402
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,031
Can't do that, Mr. Edwards.

403
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:39,540
You got cauliflower in your ears?
I gotta win the championship.

404
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:43,110
You ain't got a prayer.
Then bet against me.

405
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:47,488
For even money? Ha!
I get 20-to-1 betting a round.

406
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,527
And the round is numero uno.

407
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:54,429
What if, um
- What if I tell you what round to bet?

408
00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:01,229
On you?
No. No, I'm not that stupid.

409
00:34:05,744 --> 00:34:10,408
This is crazy. We can get
20-to-1 betting the round.

410
00:34:10,482 --> 00:34:13,144
Honey, this is our life savings.

411
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:18,478
God's on our side.
We can't lose.

412
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:23,220
Of course, we have to share
the winnings with the church.

413
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:26,889
You mean Sister Angela.
For the chapel.

414
00:34:26,965 --> 00:34:31,959
Well, I don't see you asking her to
streak. I couldn't ask a nun to streak.

415
00:34:32,037 --> 00:34:35,029
No. Just a tramp like me.

416
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:39,537
Dixie,

417
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:42,444
you're not a tramp.

418
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:44,675
You're a stripper.
That's a profession.

419
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:48,452
So's hooking.

420
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:52,920
Don't do this.

421
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:56,483
Your streaking's the only chance
I have to knock Tiger Joe Jackson out.

422
00:34:56,561 --> 00:35:02,227
I need you, Dixie,
to win.

423
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:10,071
And after that,
it'll be nothing but...

424
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:14,510
jelly-filled, sugar-glazed, and, um-

425
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:20,315
Sprinkles on top.
Yeah.

426
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:25,255
Sprinkles on top.

427
00:35:32,197 --> 00:35:34,131
Cody?

428
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,126
Sister Angela.

429
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:57,118
What's wrong?

430
00:35:57,188 --> 00:36:00,089
A Mr. Edwards
was here to see you.

431
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,592
Edwards.

432
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:06,152
He couldn't stay, but he
wanted me to give you a message.

433
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:09,530
He said that...

434
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:13,093
I wanna make sure
I get this exactly right.

435
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,662
He said that he's thought it over,

436
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:19,540
and he's decided that he wants to
call the rounds, not you.

437
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:25,709
You're supposed to
take a dive in the first.

438
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,212
And he left this for you.

439
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:35,623
There's a thousand dollars in there.

440
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:38,856
I hope you don't think
too badly of me for looking.

441
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,668
Sister Angela.

442
00:36:52,177 --> 00:36:57,012
I thought that God
sent me a champion.

443
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:03,347
But he sent me a cheat.

444
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:10,988
I don't expect you to believe
anything I say, but I've gotta say it.

445
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:18,435
I'm not the Kid Cody whose fights
were fixed for the last year.

446
00:37:18,503 --> 00:37:21,939
And more important,
I'm not the same Kid Cody...

447
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:24,770
who is gonna
take a dive in the first round.

448
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:30,512
You're telling me you're going
to win tomorrow? I'm damn well...

449
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:34,245
'Scuse me. I'm gonna try.

450
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,756
I would like to believe you, Cody.

451
00:37:43,962 --> 00:37:45,896
But I can't.

452
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:51,032
I just don't think I can
believe in anything anymore.

453
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:56,867
Then I don't have
a prayer of winning.

454
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:01,503
What do you mean?

455
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:03,672
As long as you believed in me...

456
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:08,117
that I could win... I believed it.

457
00:38:08,186 --> 00:38:12,179
I mean, maybe that's all winning is,
having the right person believe in you.

458
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:20,027
Don't give up on me, Sister.

459
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:27,702
Not if you want that castle.

460
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:37,845
This is the main event of the evening.
Twelve rounds for...

461
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:40,783
the Heavyweight Championship
of the State of California.

462
00:38:40,852 --> 00:38:43,184
The challenger in
the blue corner to my left,

463
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:48,248
wearing white trunks with gold stripes,
from Sacramento, California,

464
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:52,820
at 185, Clarence "Kid" Cody.

465
00:38:55,033 --> 00:38:58,332
In the red corner,
wearing gold trunks,

466
00:38:58,403 --> 00:39:02,339
from Hawthorne, California, at 207,

467
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:08,277
the Heavyweight Champion of the State
of California, Tiger Joe Jackson.

468
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:15,150
Now you both received your
instructions in the dressing room.

469
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:18,711
Are there any questions?
Uh, no.

470
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:23,284
- Touch gloves and may the best man win.
- Get ready to take a nap, boy.

471
00:39:30,068 --> 00:39:32,502
Who are you looking for, Kid?
Just a friend.

472
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:37,564
Guess he couldn't make it.
Wishing' you didn't? Go on, Kid.

473
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,654
Go get 'im, Cody!

474
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:11,073
- Cody, get up!
- Two, three,

475
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:16,876
four, five, six,

476
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:20,008
- seven...
- That's it.

477
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:24,249
- Come on, Cody!
- Okay. Where you at?

478
00:40:24,322 --> 00:40:26,882
Saskatchewan.
Huh?

479
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:28,892
Sacramento.

480
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:36,098
- Come on, Cody. That's it!
- That's the way, sweetie. Get 'im!

481
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:42,439
Come on, Cody!

482
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:55,416
Oh, no.

483
00:40:58,156 --> 00:40:59,418
Now?

484
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:07,822
Look, it's a streaker. !

485
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:25,182
Helluva fight, Sam.
Right on the button.

486
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:30,585
Al, I didn't think you'd show. Are you
kidding? I would never miss a fight.

487
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:35,319
- Five, six.
- Uh-oh, I think you made him angry.

488
00:41:35,393 --> 00:41:37,987
Course I made him angry.
I knocked him out...

489
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:46,200
Come on, now. Stay on the balls of your feet.
Keep your guard up and pop him with the left.

490
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:49,330
Come on. Let's go. Pop, pop, pop
with the left. Pop 'im! Pop 'im!

491
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:55,036
Pop, pop 'im again!

492
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:02,876
Downstairs! Bring his guard down!
Get 'im in the gut!

493
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:08,284
Ain't this a kick in the butt.

494
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,121
Where'd that come from?
God knows.

495
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:18,635
Keep it going. Hit my hand, Sam! Hit my hand!

496
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:22,195
Hit it! Hit it! Hit it!

497
00:42:57,675 --> 00:43:01,839
Here come the jelly-filled, sugar-glazed
and sprinkles on top!

498
00:43:03,181 --> 00:43:07,015
We won. Yes. In the eighth
round just like you predicted.

499
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:09,985
What are you talking about?
Muhammad Ali.

500
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:14,218
We bet everything we had that he'd knock
out Foreman in the eighth round in Zaire,

501
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:16,624
and he just did it a couple of
seconds ago. That's the round...

502
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:18,628
you told Edwards to bet on.
Uh-huh.

503
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:22,029
Only I didn't believe him.
How'd you know, Kid?

504
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:32,036
Well, uh, when you're fighting
for the Lord, you get inside tips.

505
00:43:34,145 --> 00:43:37,637
It was fixed. It was fixed
and somehow you got wind of it.

506
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:41,549
It wasn't fixed. Then how
else would you have known?

507
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:46,284
Say I got a hunch
and had faith.

508
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:48,723
Mm. I did too.

509
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:52,559
You and me had a deal. You were
gonna go down in the first round.

510
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:56,499
Dixie.

511
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,604
Roscoe.

512
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:05,967
I got your money.
It's just not here.

513
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:07,696
We bet all of our savings and...

514
00:44:07,697 --> 00:44:11,572
the thousand dollars you gave me
to take a dive on Ali in the eighth.

515
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:16,382
Roscoe here, he owes us
a grand total of...

516
00:44:16,454 --> 00:44:19,150
Forty-eight thousand dollars.

517
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:24,593
Twenty for us, 20 for Sister Angela's
chapel and eight for you, Jake.

518
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:27,187
If that's not enough,
I guess you're gonna have to kill me.

519
00:44:27,265 --> 00:44:29,199
No.

520
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:37,430
Roscoe?
Yeah?

521
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:40,807
Looks to me like you owe
I and my partners here some money.

522
00:44:40,878 --> 00:44:43,972
Yeah, well, okay. You take
a check? Shut your face.

523
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:47,211
Oh, look, forget about it. I'm just
kidding. I was telling a joke there.

524
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,322
Hey, I'm gonna go get the money. Dixie.

525
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:55,882
- Yeah?
- Hurry back.

526
00:44:58,029 --> 00:44:59,963
Okay.

527
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:14,634
Looks like
you're gonna get your chapel.

528
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:17,806
And, there's gonna be
a little extra.

529
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:21,045
I, um, I took the liberty of...

530
00:45:21,118 --> 00:45:23,143
betting a little money,
and, well...

531
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,984
I am so ashamed for doubting you.

532
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:29,424
Well, that's all right, Sister.
You didn't doubt God.

533
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:31,984
But I did.

534
00:45:32,997 --> 00:45:36,455
Last night in church, I gave up.

535
00:45:36,534 --> 00:45:39,325
When I saw that man hit you and you fell down...

536
00:45:39,326 --> 00:45:41,767
I just didn't believe in anything anymore.

537
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:46,897
But then when you got up, I saw
that you were telling me the truth,

538
00:45:46,898 --> 00:45:48,509
that you were really trying to win.

539
00:45:49,647 --> 00:45:53,583
At that moment, all of my faith
just came flooding back into my heart.

540
00:45:53,651 --> 00:45:58,611
And I didn't care whether you won or
lost, because you were really trying.

541
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:00,520
Thank you, Cody.

542
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:09,989
Thank you for my chapel.

543
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:14,800
Thank you for giving me back
my faith.
