1
00:00:54,667 --> 00:00:59,502
SAGAN: We are drifting in
a great ocean of space and time.

2
00:01:01,207 --> 00:01:04,108
In that ocean, the events
that shape the future...

3
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,710
...are working themselves out.

4
00:01:08,915 --> 00:01:12,248
Each creature and every world,
to the remotest star...

5
00:01:12,451 --> 00:01:14,351
...owe their existence to...

6
00:01:14,554 --> 00:01:17,387
...the great, coursing,
implacable forces of nature...

7
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,718
...but also, to minor happenstance.

8
00:01:23,262 --> 00:01:26,527
We are carried with our planet
around the sun.

9
00:01:26,732 --> 00:01:30,168
The Earth has made more than
4 billion circuits of our star...

10
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:32,200
...since its origin.

11
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,142
The sun itself travels about
the core of the Milky Way galaxy.

12
00:01:38,344 --> 00:01:40,972
Our galaxy is moving
among the other galaxies.

13
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,547
We have always been space travelers.

14
00:01:46,352 --> 00:01:51,221
These fine sand grains are all,
more or less, uniform in size.

15
00:01:52,124 --> 00:01:55,355
They're produced from bigger rocks
through ages of...

16
00:01:55,561 --> 00:01:59,395
...jostling and rubbing,
abrasion and erosion.

17
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:03,467
Driven in part by
the distant moon and sun.

18
00:02:03,803 --> 00:02:07,364
So the roots of the present
lie buried in the past.

19
00:02:07,573 --> 00:02:11,339
We are also travelers in time.

20
00:02:15,815 --> 00:02:17,043
But trapped on Earth...

21
00:02:17,249 --> 00:02:20,582
...we've had little to say about
where we go in time and space...

22
00:02:20,786 --> 00:02:22,151
...or how fast.

23
00:02:22,355 --> 00:02:26,086
But now we're thinking
about true journeys in time...

24
00:02:26,292 --> 00:02:30,194
...and real voyages
to the distant stars.

25
00:02:31,964 --> 00:02:36,560
A handful of sand contains
about 1 0,000 grains...

26
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:38,964
...more than all the stars
we can see...

27
00:02:39,171 --> 00:02:41,503
...with the naked eye
on a clear night.

28
00:02:41,707 --> 00:02:43,800
But the number of stars we can see...

29
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,605
...is only the tiniest fraction
of the number of stars that are.

30
00:02:48,414 --> 00:02:51,440
What we see at night
is the merest smattering...

31
00:02:51,651 --> 00:02:53,619
...of the nearest stars...

32
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:58,085
...with a few more distant bright
stars thrown in for good measure.

33
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,158
Meanwhile, the cosmos
is rich beyond measure.

34
00:03:02,361 --> 00:03:04,488
The number of stars
in the universe...

35
00:03:04,697 --> 00:03:08,030
...is larger than all the grains
of sand on all the beaches...

36
00:03:08,234 --> 00:03:09,826
...of the planet Earth.

37
00:03:13,706 --> 00:03:18,507
Long ago, before we had figured out
that the stars are distant suns...

38
00:03:18,711 --> 00:03:21,839
...they seemed to us
to make pictures in the sky.

39
00:03:22,048 --> 00:03:24,846
Just follow the dots.

40
00:03:26,152 --> 00:03:29,315
The Big Dipper constellation
today in North America...

41
00:03:29,522 --> 00:03:31,683
...has had many other incarnations.

42
00:03:31,891 --> 00:03:34,155
Every culture, ancient and modern...

43
00:03:34,427 --> 00:03:38,193
...has placed its totems
and concerns among the stars.

44
00:03:38,397 --> 00:03:42,390
From a Chinese bureaucrat
to a German wagon.

45
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:50,239
But very ancient cultures would have
seen different constellations...

46
00:03:50,443 --> 00:03:53,742
...because the stars move
with respect to one another.

47
00:03:53,946 --> 00:03:58,713
We can give a computer the present
positions and motions of stars...

48
00:03:58,918 --> 00:04:02,615
...and then run the patterns
back into time.

49
00:04:04,623 --> 00:04:08,320
Every constellation is a single frame
in a cosmic movie...

50
00:04:08,527 --> 00:04:10,893
...but because our lives
are so short...

51
00:04:11,097 --> 00:04:13,088
...because star patterns
change slowly...

52
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:16,234
...we tend not to notice
it's a movie.

53
00:04:16,435 --> 00:04:20,235
A million years ago,
there was no Big Dipper.

54
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,938
Our ancestors, looking up
and wondering about the stars...

55
00:04:24,143 --> 00:04:27,772
...saw some other pattern
in the northern skies.

56
00:04:28,814 --> 00:04:33,183
We can also run a constellation,
Leo the Lion, say, forward in time...

57
00:04:33,385 --> 00:04:37,287
...and see what the patterns
in the stars will be in the future.

58
00:04:39,058 --> 00:04:41,458
A million years from now,
Leo might be renamed...

59
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,356
...the constellation
of the Radio Telescope.

60
00:04:44,563 --> 00:04:47,862
Although I suspect radio telescopes
then will be as obsolete...

61
00:04:48,067 --> 00:04:49,967
...as stone spears are now.

62
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:54,196
Or, here's the constellation
of Cetus the Whale.

63
00:05:03,215 --> 00:05:07,948
A million years ago, it may have
been called something else.

64
00:05:08,154 --> 00:05:09,644
Perhaps the Spear.

65
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:19,288
Now, let's run fast-forward
through a billion nights.

66
00:05:24,436 --> 00:05:26,063
Millions of years from now...

67
00:05:26,272 --> 00:05:30,470
...some other very different image
will be featured in this cosmic movie.

68
00:05:38,417 --> 00:05:41,443
In Orion the Hunter,
things are changing...

69
00:05:41,654 --> 00:05:43,588
...not only because
the stars are moving...

70
00:05:43,789 --> 00:05:46,553
...but also because
the stars are evolving.

71
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:50,320
Many of Orion's stars are
hot, young and short-lived.

72
00:05:50,529 --> 00:05:54,590
They're born, live and die within
a span of only a few million years.

73
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,633
If we run Orion forward in time...

74
00:05:57,837 --> 00:06:00,670
...we see the births
and explosive deaths...

75
00:06:00,873 --> 00:06:02,397
...of dozens of stars...

76
00:06:02,608 --> 00:06:06,738
...flashing on and winking off
like fireflies in the night.

77
00:06:09,181 --> 00:06:12,708
If we wait long enough,
we see the constellations change.

78
00:06:12,918 --> 00:06:16,854
But if we go far enough,
we also see the star patterns alter.

79
00:06:17,056 --> 00:06:18,921
Two-dimensional constellations...

80
00:06:19,124 --> 00:06:23,117
...are only the appearance of stars
strewn through three dimensions.

81
00:06:23,329 --> 00:06:27,629
Some are dim and near,
others are bright but farther away.

82
00:06:28,868 --> 00:06:31,200
Could a space traveler
actually see...

83
00:06:31,403 --> 00:06:34,099
...the patterns of
the constellations change?

84
00:06:34,306 --> 00:06:39,175
For that, you must travel roughly as
far as the constellation is from us.

85
00:06:39,645 --> 00:06:42,671
Here, we're traveling
hundreds of light-years...

86
00:06:42,882 --> 00:06:47,182
...circling all the way around
the stars of the Big Dipper.

87
00:06:50,723 --> 00:06:52,850
Inhabitants of planets
around other stars...

88
00:06:53,058 --> 00:06:55,492
...will see different constellations
than us...

89
00:06:55,694 --> 00:06:58,663
...because their vantage points
are different.

90
00:07:06,739 --> 00:07:10,402
Here we are
in the constellation Andromeda...

91
00:07:10,609 --> 00:07:15,410
...or at least a model of it
next to the constellation Perseus.

92
00:07:15,614 --> 00:07:17,775
Andromeda, in the Greek myth...

93
00:07:17,983 --> 00:07:21,783
...was the maiden
who was saved by Perseus...

94
00:07:21,987 --> 00:07:23,921
...from a sea monster.

95
00:07:24,123 --> 00:07:29,026
This star just above me
is Beta Andromedae...

96
00:07:29,228 --> 00:07:31,856
...the second brightest star
in the constellation...

97
00:07:32,064 --> 00:07:35,227
...75 light-years from the Earth.

98
00:07:35,434 --> 00:07:38,528
The light by which we see this star...

99
00:07:38,737 --> 00:07:42,867
...has spent 75 years
traversing interstellar space...

100
00:07:43,075 --> 00:07:45,066
...on its journey to the Earth.

101
00:07:45,277 --> 00:07:48,872
In the unlikely event
that Beta Andromedae...

102
00:07:49,081 --> 00:07:51,606
...blew itself up
a week ago Tuesday...

103
00:07:51,817 --> 00:07:54,581
...we will not know of it
for another 75 years...

104
00:07:54,787 --> 00:07:58,780
...as this interesting information,
traveling at the speed of light...

105
00:07:58,991 --> 00:08:02,620
...crosses the enormous
interstellar distances.

106
00:08:02,828 --> 00:08:05,319
When the light we see
from this star set out...

107
00:08:05,531 --> 00:08:08,261
...on its long
interstellar voyage...

108
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:11,027
...the young Albert Einstein...

109
00:08:11,236 --> 00:08:14,103
...working as a Swiss patent clerk...

110
00:08:14,306 --> 00:08:18,208
...had just published his epochal
special theory of relativity...

111
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,741
...here on Earth.

112
00:08:20,612 --> 00:08:21,840
We see...

113
00:08:22,047 --> 00:08:26,177
...that space and time
are intertwined.

114
00:08:26,385 --> 00:08:29,252
We cannot look out into space...

115
00:08:29,455 --> 00:08:32,754
...without looking back into time.

116
00:08:33,025 --> 00:08:36,119
The speed of light is very fast...

117
00:08:36,328 --> 00:08:39,525
...but space is very empty...

118
00:08:39,732 --> 00:08:43,031
...and the stars are very far apart.

119
00:08:43,235 --> 00:08:46,363
The distances that we've been
talking about up to now...

120
00:08:46,572 --> 00:08:50,372
...are very small
by the usual astronomical standards.

121
00:08:50,576 --> 00:08:53,204
In fact, the distance
from the Earth...

122
00:08:53,412 --> 00:08:55,403
...to the center
of the Milky Way galaxy...

123
00:08:55,614 --> 00:08:58,481
...is 30,000 light-years.

124
00:08:59,451 --> 00:09:04,388
From our galaxy to the nearest
spiral galaxy like our own...

125
00:09:04,723 --> 00:09:06,520
...called M31 ...

126
00:09:06,725 --> 00:09:09,626
...and which is also within,
that means behind...

127
00:09:09,828 --> 00:09:11,796
...the constellation Andromeda...

128
00:09:12,531 --> 00:09:16,262
...is 2 million light-years.

129
00:09:17,503 --> 00:09:20,700
When the light we see today
from M31 ...

130
00:09:20,906 --> 00:09:23,431
...left on its journey for Earth...

131
00:09:23,642 --> 00:09:25,576
...there were no human beings...

132
00:09:25,778 --> 00:09:29,077
...although our ancestors
were nicely evolving...

133
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:32,341
...and very rapidly,
to our present form.

134
00:09:33,018 --> 00:09:35,509
There are much greater distances
in astronomy.

135
00:09:35,721 --> 00:09:39,316
The distance from the Earth
to the most distant quasars...

136
00:09:39,525 --> 00:09:42,961
...is 8 or 1 0 billion light-years.

137
00:09:43,162 --> 00:09:47,861
We see them as they were before
the Earth itself accumulated...

138
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:51,628
...before the Milky Way galaxy
was formed.

139
00:09:51,837 --> 00:09:55,466
The fastest space vehicles ever
launched by the human species...

140
00:09:55,674 --> 00:09:57,608
...are the Voyager spacecraft.

141
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,505
They are traveling so fast...

142
00:09:59,711 --> 00:10:03,306
...that it's only
1 0,000 times slower...

143
00:10:03,816 --> 00:10:05,113
...than the speed of light.

144
00:10:05,317 --> 00:10:07,945
The Voyager spacecraft
will take 40,000 years...

145
00:10:08,153 --> 00:10:10,212
...to go the distance
to the nearest stars...

146
00:10:10,422 --> 00:10:13,619
...and they're not even headed
towards the nearest stars.

147
00:10:13,826 --> 00:10:16,420
But is there a method
by which we could travel...

148
00:10:16,628 --> 00:10:20,120
...in a conveniently short time
to the stars?

149
00:10:20,332 --> 00:10:23,165
Can we travel close
to the speed of light?

150
00:10:23,368 --> 00:10:26,098
And what's magic
about the speed of light?

151
00:10:26,305 --> 00:10:28,899
Can't we travel faster than that?

152
00:10:30,909 --> 00:10:34,743
It turns out that
there is something very strange...

153
00:10:34,947 --> 00:10:36,414
...about the speed of light.

154
00:10:36,615 --> 00:10:38,674
Something that provides the key...

155
00:10:38,884 --> 00:10:42,285
...to our understanding
of time and space.

156
00:10:44,022 --> 00:10:45,717
The story of its discovery...

157
00:10:45,924 --> 00:10:49,519
...takes us to Tuscany
in northern Italy.

158
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,264
There's something timeless
about this place.

159
00:10:54,466 --> 00:10:58,129
A century ago, it probably
looked very much the same.

160
00:11:10,249 --> 00:11:14,447
If you had traveled these roads
in the summer of 1895...

161
00:11:14,653 --> 00:11:18,783
...you might have come upon a
16-year-old German high-school dropout.

162
00:11:18,991 --> 00:11:22,154
His teacher told him that
he'd never amount to anything...

163
00:11:22,361 --> 00:11:25,819
...that his attitude destroyed
classroom discipline...

164
00:11:26,031 --> 00:11:27,760
...that he should drop out.

165
00:11:27,966 --> 00:11:29,957
So he left and came here...

166
00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:32,603
...where he enjoyed
wandering these roads...

167
00:11:32,804 --> 00:11:35,272
...and giving his mind
free rein to explore.

168
00:11:37,276 --> 00:11:39,744
One day, he began
to think about light...

169
00:11:39,945 --> 00:11:41,936
...about how fast it travels.

170
00:11:42,147 --> 00:11:45,207
We always measure
the speed of a moving object...

171
00:11:45,417 --> 00:11:47,385
...relative to something else.

172
00:11:47,586 --> 00:11:51,613
I'm moving at about 10 kilometers
an hour relative to the ground.

173
00:11:51,823 --> 00:11:53,450
But the ground isn't at rest.

174
00:11:53,659 --> 00:11:57,425
The Earth is turning at more
than 1600 kilometers an hour.

175
00:11:57,629 --> 00:12:00,097
The Earth itself is
in orbit around the sun.

176
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:04,360
The sun is moving among
the drifting stars, and so on.

177
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,971
It was hard for the young man
to imagine some absolute standard...

178
00:12:08,173 --> 00:12:11,040
...to measure all these
relative motions against.

179
00:12:20,852 --> 00:12:24,720
He knew that sound waves are
a vibration of the air...

180
00:12:24,923 --> 00:12:28,086
...and their speed is measured
relative to the air itself.

181
00:12:28,293 --> 00:12:31,490
But sunlight travels across
the vacuum of empty space.

182
00:12:31,697 --> 00:12:33,961
"Do light waves move
relative to something else?

183
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:37,761
And if so," he wondered,
"relative to what?"

184
00:12:41,306 --> 00:12:45,436
That teenage dropout's name...

185
00:12:46,111 --> 00:12:47,772
...was Albert Einstein.

186
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,915
And his ruminations changed the world.

187
00:12:56,255 --> 00:13:00,385
He had been fascinated
by Bernstein's 1 869...

188
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,855
...People's Book of Natural Science.

189
00:13:05,063 --> 00:13:08,226
Here, on its very first page...

190
00:13:09,101 --> 00:13:13,231
...it describes the astonishing speed
of electricity through wires...

191
00:13:13,572 --> 00:13:15,506
...and light through space.

192
00:13:15,841 --> 00:13:19,777
Einstein wondered, perhaps for
the first time, in northern Italy...

193
00:13:20,545 --> 00:13:24,743
...what the world would look like if
you could travel on a wave of light.

194
00:13:25,317 --> 00:13:27,512
To travel at the speed of light.

195
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:32,520
What an engaging and magical thought
for a teenage boy on the road...

196
00:13:32,724 --> 00:13:36,592
...where the countryside is dappled
and rippling in sunlight.

197
00:13:47,606 --> 00:13:52,009
You couldn't tell you were on a light
wave if you were traveling with it.

198
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,838
If you started on a wave crest...

199
00:13:55,047 --> 00:13:59,848
...you would stay on the crest and
lose all notion of it being a wave.

200
00:14:00,052 --> 00:14:04,887
Something funny happens
at the speed of light.

201
00:14:35,487 --> 00:14:39,253
The more Einstein thought about it,
the more troubling it became.

202
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:42,018
Paradoxes seemed to pop up all over...

203
00:14:42,227 --> 00:14:44,195
...if you could travel
at the speed of light.

204
00:14:44,396 --> 00:14:47,797
Certain ideas had been
accepted as true...

205
00:14:47,999 --> 00:14:50,467
...without sufficiently
careful thought.

206
00:14:52,604 --> 00:14:56,631
One of those ideas had to do
with the light from a moving object.

207
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:01,341
The images by which we see the world
are made of light...

208
00:15:01,546 --> 00:15:03,673
...and are carried
at the speed of light...

209
00:15:03,882 --> 00:15:07,147
...300,000 kilometers a second.

210
00:15:07,753 --> 00:15:11,553
You might think that the image of me
should be moving out ahead of me...

211
00:15:11,757 --> 00:15:14,988
...at the speed of light
plus the speed of the bicycle.

212
00:15:15,193 --> 00:15:18,720
If I'm moving towards you
faster than a horse-and-cart...

213
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:21,899
...then my image should be
approaching you that much faster.

214
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,694
My image ought to arrive earlier.

215
00:15:26,838 --> 00:15:29,363
But in reality
you don't see any time delay.

216
00:15:29,808 --> 00:15:33,676
In a near collision, for example,
you see everything happen at once.

217
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:37,542
Horse, cart, swerve, bicycle.
All simultaneous.

218
00:15:38,283 --> 00:15:42,242
But how would it look if
it were proper to add the velocities?

219
00:15:42,454 --> 00:15:45,890
Since I'm heading toward you, you'd
add my speed to the speed of light.

220
00:15:46,091 --> 00:15:50,858
So my image ought to arrive before
the image of the horse-and-cart.

221
00:15:51,763 --> 00:15:54,254
I'd be cycling towards you
quite normally.

222
00:15:54,466 --> 00:15:57,958
To me, a collision
would seem imminent.

223
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:01,071
But you'd see me swerve
for no apparent reason...

224
00:16:01,273 --> 00:16:03,605
...and have a collision with nothing.

225
00:16:04,643 --> 00:16:07,441
Now, the horse-and-cart
aren't headed towards you.

226
00:16:07,646 --> 00:16:11,377
Their image would arrive only
at the speed of light.

227
00:16:12,117 --> 00:16:14,711
Could it seem to me that
I just missed colliding...

228
00:16:15,253 --> 00:16:17,813
...while to you it wasn't even close?

229
00:16:18,023 --> 00:16:20,184
In precise laboratory experiments...

230
00:16:20,392 --> 00:16:23,520
...scientists have never observed
any such thing.

231
00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:26,495
If the world is to be understood...

232
00:16:26,832 --> 00:16:31,735
...if we are to avoid logical paradoxes
when traveling at high speeds...

233
00:16:31,937 --> 00:16:34,462
...then there are rules
which must be obeyed.

234
00:16:34,673 --> 00:16:39,406
Einstein called these rules
the special theory of relativity.

235
00:16:39,611 --> 00:16:42,136
Light from a moving object
travels at the same speed...

236
00:16:42,347 --> 00:16:45,976
...no matter whether the object
is at rest or in motion.

237
00:16:46,184 --> 00:16:50,848
"Thou shalt not add my speed
to the speed of light."

238
00:16:51,056 --> 00:16:55,891
Also, no material object can travel
at or beyond the speed of light.

239
00:16:56,094 --> 00:17:00,155
Nothing in physics prevents you from
traveling close to the speed of light.

240
00:17:00,365 --> 00:17:04,165
99.9 percent the speed of light
is just fine.

241
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:06,735
But no matter how hard you try...

242
00:17:06,938 --> 00:17:09,702
...you can never gain
that last decimal point.

243
00:17:09,908 --> 00:17:12,172
For the world
to be logically consistent...

244
00:17:12,377 --> 00:17:15,505
...there must be a cosmic speed limit.

245
00:17:16,281 --> 00:17:18,977
The crack of a whip is,
due to its tip...

246
00:17:19,184 --> 00:17:21,175
...moving faster
than the speed of sound.

247
00:17:23,822 --> 00:17:25,050
It makes a shock wave...

248
00:17:25,257 --> 00:17:29,091
...a small sonic boom
in the Italian countryside.

249
00:17:29,294 --> 00:17:31,626
A thunderclap has a similar origin.

250
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:35,163
So does the sound of
a supersonic airplane.

251
00:17:37,202 --> 00:17:41,764
So why is the speed of light a barrier
any more than the speed of sound?

252
00:17:41,973 --> 00:17:43,838
The answer is not just that...

253
00:17:44,042 --> 00:17:46,636
...light travels a million times
faster than sound.

254
00:17:46,845 --> 00:17:50,508
It's not merely an engineering problem
like the supersonic airplane.

255
00:17:51,082 --> 00:17:55,143
Instead, the light barrier is
a fundamental law of nature...

256
00:17:55,353 --> 00:17:57,253
...as basic as gravity.

257
00:17:57,455 --> 00:18:00,822
Einstein found his absolute framework
for the world:

258
00:18:01,026 --> 00:18:05,395
This sturdy pillar among all
the relative motions of the cosmos.

259
00:18:05,597 --> 00:18:09,658
Light travels just as fast,
no matter how its source is moving.

260
00:18:09,868 --> 00:18:13,895
The speed of light is constant,
relative to everything else.

261
00:18:14,105 --> 00:18:17,404
Nothing can ever catch up with light.

262
00:18:20,378 --> 00:18:23,905
Einstein's prohibition against
traveling faster than light...

263
00:18:24,115 --> 00:18:26,845
...seems to clash with
our common sense notions.

264
00:18:27,052 --> 00:18:29,850
But why should we expect
our common sense notions...

265
00:18:30,055 --> 00:18:32,956
...to have any reliability
in a matter of this sort?

266
00:18:33,158 --> 00:18:37,026
Why should our experience
at 1 0 kilometers an hour...

267
00:18:37,228 --> 00:18:39,423
...constrain the laws of nature...

268
00:18:39,631 --> 00:18:42,930
...at 300,000 kilometers a second?

269
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:47,764
Relativity sets limits...

270
00:18:47,973 --> 00:18:51,033
...on what humans ultimately can do.

271
00:18:51,576 --> 00:18:54,204
The universe is not required...

272
00:18:54,412 --> 00:18:58,781
...to be in perfect harmony
with human ambition.

273
00:19:02,253 --> 00:19:05,154
Imagine a place
where the speed of light...

274
00:19:05,357 --> 00:19:08,724
...isn't its true value
of 300,000 kilometers a second...

275
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:11,487
...but something a lot less.

276
00:19:11,696 --> 00:19:15,097
Let's say, 40 kilometers an hour...

277
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,359
...and strictly enforced.

278
00:19:18,269 --> 00:19:22,171
Just as in the real world we can
never reach the speed of light...

279
00:19:22,374 --> 00:19:24,239
...the commandment here is still...

280
00:19:24,442 --> 00:19:27,775
..."Thou shalt not travel
faster than light."

281
00:19:27,979 --> 00:19:32,473
We can do thought experiments on
what happens near the speed of light...

282
00:19:32,684 --> 00:19:37,018
...here 40 kilometers per hour,
the speed of a motor scooter.

283
00:19:40,358 --> 00:19:44,351
You can't break the laws of nature.
There are no penalties for doing so.

284
00:19:44,729 --> 00:19:46,594
The real world and this one...

285
00:19:46,931 --> 00:19:51,061
...are merely so arranged
that transgressions can't happen.

286
00:19:51,269 --> 00:19:55,205
The job of physics is to find out
what those laws are.

287
00:19:57,542 --> 00:20:00,511
Before Einstein,
physicists thought that...

288
00:20:00,712 --> 00:20:03,112
...there were privileged frames
of reference...

289
00:20:03,314 --> 00:20:05,805
...some special places and times...

290
00:20:06,017 --> 00:20:08,577
...against which everything else
had to be measured.

291
00:20:08,787 --> 00:20:12,154
Einstein encountered
a similar notion in human affairs.

292
00:20:12,357 --> 00:20:15,053
The idea that the customs
of a particular nation...

293
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:18,821
...his native Germany
or Italy or anywhere...

294
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:22,966
...are the standard which all
other societies must be measured.

295
00:20:23,835 --> 00:20:27,271
But Einstein rejected the strident
nationalism of his time.

296
00:20:27,472 --> 00:20:30,566
He believed every culture
had its own validity.

297
00:20:30,775 --> 00:20:32,709
Also in physics,
he understood that...

298
00:20:32,911 --> 00:20:35,175
...there are no privileged
frames of reference.

299
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:38,508
Every observer,
in any place, time or motion...

300
00:20:38,717 --> 00:20:41,345
...must deduce
the same laws of nature.

301
00:20:41,553 --> 00:20:43,453
(SPEAKING IN ITALIAN)

302
00:20:44,989 --> 00:20:48,823
A speed is simply how much space
you cover in a given time...

303
00:20:49,027 --> 00:20:51,689
...as any kid on
a motor scooter knows.

304
00:20:55,133 --> 00:20:56,998
Since near the velocity of light...

305
00:20:57,202 --> 00:20:59,693
...we cannot simply add speeds...

306
00:20:59,904 --> 00:21:03,533
...the familiar notions of
absolute space and absolute time...

307
00:21:03,742 --> 00:21:06,734
...independent of your
relative motion, must give way.

308
00:21:06,945 --> 00:21:09,505
That's why, as Einstein showed...

309
00:21:09,714 --> 00:21:13,673
...funny things have to happen
close to the speed of light.

310
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:18,253
There, our conventional perspectives
of space and time...

311
00:21:18,456 --> 00:21:20,515
...strangely change.

312
00:21:22,961 --> 00:21:26,897
Your nose is just a little closer
to me than your ears.

313
00:21:27,098 --> 00:21:29,328
Light reflected off your nose
reaches me...

314
00:21:29,534 --> 00:21:31,764
...an instant in time
before your ears.

315
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:35,201
But suppose I had a magic camera...

316
00:21:35,406 --> 00:21:38,398
...so that I could see
your nose and your ears...

317
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:40,578
...at precisely the same instant?

318
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:42,246
(SCOOTER STARTS UP)

319
00:21:42,447 --> 00:21:43,914
(SCOOTER HONKS)

320
00:21:44,115 --> 00:21:48,552
With such a camera you could take
some pretty interesting pictures.

321
00:21:49,921 --> 00:21:53,322
Paolo says goodbye to
his little brother, Vincenzo...

322
00:21:53,691 --> 00:21:55,784
-Ciao, Vincenzo.
-Ciao, Paolo.

323
00:21:56,594 --> 00:21:58,221
...and rides off.

324
00:21:58,429 --> 00:22:00,954
He's now going more than
half the speed of light.

325
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:03,726
He is almost catching up
with his own light waves.

326
00:22:03,935 --> 00:22:06,495
This compresses the light waves
in front of him...

327
00:22:06,704 --> 00:22:08,433
...and his image becomes blue.

328
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:12,437
The shorter wavelength is
what makes blue light waves blue.

329
00:22:13,011 --> 00:22:16,742
Also Paolo becomes skinny
in the direction of motion.

330
00:22:16,948 --> 00:22:19,007
This isn't just some optical illusion.

331
00:22:19,217 --> 00:22:22,448
It really happens when you travel
near the speed of light.

332
00:22:23,221 --> 00:22:27,555
As he roars away, he leaves his own
light waves stretched out behind him.

333
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:29,124
Long light waves are red.

334
00:22:29,327 --> 00:22:32,888
We say that his receding image
is red-shifted.

335
00:22:34,465 --> 00:22:39,129
Now Paolo leaves for
a short tour of the countryside.

336
00:22:39,571 --> 00:22:43,098
He experiences something
even stranger.

337
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,940
Everything he can see is squeezed...

338
00:22:48,146 --> 00:22:50,512
...into a moving window
just ahead of him...

339
00:22:50,715 --> 00:22:54,116
...blue-shifted at the center,
red-shifted at the edges.

340
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:57,618
To a passerby, Paolo appears
blue-shifted when approaching...

341
00:22:57,822 --> 00:22:59,551
...red-shifted when receding.

342
00:22:59,757 --> 00:23:02,817
But to him, the entire world
is both coming and going...

343
00:23:03,027 --> 00:23:04,756
...at nearly the speed of light.

344
00:23:04,963 --> 00:23:08,592
Roadside houses and trees
that has already gone past...

345
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,236
...still appear to him at the edge
of his forward field of view...

346
00:23:12,437 --> 00:23:15,133
...but distorted and red-shifted.

347
00:23:16,307 --> 00:23:20,038
When he slows down,
everything again looks normal.

348
00:23:21,579 --> 00:23:23,945
Only very close
to the speed of light...

349
00:23:24,148 --> 00:23:27,743
...does the visible world
get squeezed into a kind of tunnel.

350
00:23:28,653 --> 00:23:32,111
You'd see these distortions if you
traveled near the speed of light.

351
00:23:32,323 --> 00:23:35,019
Someday, perhaps,
interstellar navigators...

352
00:23:35,226 --> 00:23:37,751
...will take their bearings
on stars behind them...

353
00:23:37,962 --> 00:23:42,456
...whose images have all crowded
together on the forward view screen.

354
00:23:44,736 --> 00:23:47,864
The most bizarre aspect of traveling
near the speed of light...

355
00:23:48,072 --> 00:23:50,666
...is that time slows down.

356
00:23:51,509 --> 00:23:53,807
All clocks,
mechanical and biological...

357
00:23:54,012 --> 00:23:56,810
...tick more slowly
near the speed of light.

358
00:23:57,015 --> 00:24:00,348
But stationary clocks tick
at their usual rate.

359
00:24:00,551 --> 00:24:02,712
If we travel close to light speed...

360
00:24:02,921 --> 00:24:06,015
...we age more slowly
than those we left behind.

361
00:24:11,462 --> 00:24:14,295
Paolo's watch and his internal
sense of time show...

362
00:24:14,832 --> 00:24:18,359
...that he has been gone from
his friends for only a few minutes.

363
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:23,136
But from their point of view,
he has been away for many decades.

364
00:24:23,341 --> 00:24:26,936
His friends have grown up,
moved on and died.

365
00:24:27,912 --> 00:24:29,539
And his younger brother has been...

366
00:24:29,747 --> 00:24:33,080
...patiently waiting
for him all this time.

367
00:24:35,219 --> 00:24:40,156
The two brothers experience
the paradox of time dilation.

368
00:24:40,358 --> 00:24:44,055
They've encountered
Einstein's special relativity.

369
00:24:45,096 --> 00:24:46,063
Vincenzo.

370
00:24:59,944 --> 00:25:02,378
This was just a thought experiment.

371
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,743
But atomic particles traveling
near the speed of light...

372
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:09,147
...do decay more slowly
than stationary particles.

373
00:25:09,354 --> 00:25:12,551
As strange and counterintuitive
as it seems...

374
00:25:12,757 --> 00:25:16,022
...time dilation is a law of nature.

375
00:25:17,895 --> 00:25:20,693
Traveling close
to the speed of light...

376
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:23,900
...is a kind of elixir of life.

377
00:25:24,869 --> 00:25:27,963
Because time slows down
close to the speed of light...

378
00:25:28,172 --> 00:25:31,039
...special relativity provides us...

379
00:25:31,242 --> 00:25:33,938
...with a means of going to the stars.

380
00:25:34,979 --> 00:25:38,176
This region of northern Italy
is not only the caldron...

381
00:25:38,383 --> 00:25:41,682
...of some of the thinking
of the young Albert Einstein...

382
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:45,353
...it is also the home
of another great genius...

383
00:25:45,556 --> 00:25:47,854
...who lived 400 years earlier.

384
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:50,357
Leonardo da Vinci.

385
00:25:51,629 --> 00:25:55,998
Leonardo delighted
in climbing these hills...

386
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,567
...and viewing the ground
from a great height...

387
00:25:59,771 --> 00:26:02,069
...as if he were soaring like a bird.

388
00:26:02,273 --> 00:26:04,867
He drew the first aerial views...

389
00:26:05,076 --> 00:26:08,773
...of landscapes, villages,
fortifications.

390
00:26:09,247 --> 00:26:13,183
I've been talking about Einstein
in and around this town of Vinci...

391
00:26:13,384 --> 00:26:15,545
...in which Leonardo grew up.

392
00:26:15,753 --> 00:26:18,813
Einstein greatly respected Leonardo...

393
00:26:19,023 --> 00:26:21,685
...and their spirits, in some sense...

394
00:26:21,893 --> 00:26:25,192
...inhabit this countryside still.

395
00:26:50,154 --> 00:26:53,214
Among Leonardo's
many accomplishments...

396
00:26:53,424 --> 00:26:56,791
...in painting, sculpture,
architecture, natural history...

397
00:26:56,994 --> 00:27:01,431
...anatomy, geology,
civil and military engineering...

398
00:27:01,933 --> 00:27:03,798
...he had a great passion.

399
00:27:04,035 --> 00:27:07,527
He wished to construct a machine...

400
00:27:07,738 --> 00:27:09,399
...which would fly.

401
00:27:09,941 --> 00:27:13,741
He made sketches of such machines,
built miniature models...

402
00:27:13,945 --> 00:27:18,075
...constructed great,
full-scale prototypes.

403
00:27:19,884 --> 00:27:23,547
And not a one of them ever worked.

404
00:27:24,755 --> 00:27:29,124
There were no machines of adequate
capacity available in his time.

405
00:27:29,327 --> 00:27:32,694
The technology was just not ready.

406
00:27:33,598 --> 00:27:36,829
The designs, however, were brilliant.

407
00:27:37,034 --> 00:27:40,197
For example, this bird-like machine...

408
00:27:40,404 --> 00:27:44,397
...here in the Leonardo Museum
in the town of Vinci.

409
00:27:45,576 --> 00:27:50,513
Leonardo's great designs encouraged
engineers in later epochs...

410
00:27:50,715 --> 00:27:55,084
...although Leonardo himself
was very depressed at these failures.

411
00:27:55,286 --> 00:27:57,117
But it's not his fault...

412
00:27:57,321 --> 00:28:00,347
...he was trapped in the 1 5th century.

413
00:28:01,192 --> 00:28:04,889
A somewhat similar case
occurred in 1 939...

414
00:28:05,096 --> 00:28:09,430
...when a group of engineers called
the British Interplanetary Society...

415
00:28:09,634 --> 00:28:11,898
...decided to design a ship...

416
00:28:12,103 --> 00:28:15,072
...which would carry people
to the moon.

417
00:28:15,273 --> 00:28:17,571
Now, it was by no means
the same design...

418
00:28:17,775 --> 00:28:22,439
...as the Apollo ship which actually
took people to the moon years later.

419
00:28:22,647 --> 00:28:25,207
But that design suggested that...

420
00:28:25,416 --> 00:28:27,213
...a mission to the moon
might one day...

421
00:28:27,418 --> 00:28:30,012
...be a practical
engineering possibility.

422
00:28:30,488 --> 00:28:31,682
Today...

423
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:36,319
...we have preliminary
designs of ships...

424
00:28:36,527 --> 00:28:39,724
...which will take people
to the stars.

425
00:28:39,931 --> 00:28:44,630
They are constructed in Earth orbit
and from there...

426
00:28:44,835 --> 00:28:49,772
...they venture on their great
interstellar journeys.

427
00:28:50,141 --> 00:28:51,540
One of them...

428
00:28:52,009 --> 00:28:55,001
...is called Project Orion.

429
00:28:56,147 --> 00:28:58,081
It utilizes nuclear weapons...

430
00:28:58,282 --> 00:29:02,719
...hydrogen bombs
against an inertial plate.

431
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,651
Each explosion providing
a kind of "putt-putt"...

432
00:29:06,857 --> 00:29:10,793
...a vast nuclear motorboat in space.

433
00:29:11,195 --> 00:29:14,631
Orion seems entirely practical...

434
00:29:14,832 --> 00:29:17,266
...and was under development
in the U.S...

435
00:29:17,468 --> 00:29:20,835
...until the signing
of the international treaty...

436
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:24,235
...forbidding nuclear weapons
explosions in space.

437
00:29:24,842 --> 00:29:29,779
I think, the Orion starship
is the best use of nuclear weapons...

438
00:29:29,981 --> 00:29:33,815
...provided the ships don't depart
from very near the Earth.

439
00:29:43,394 --> 00:29:46,124
Project Daedalus is
a recent design...

440
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:48,730
...of the British
Interplanetary Society.

441
00:29:48,933 --> 00:29:52,425
It assumes the existence
of a nuclear fusion reactor...

442
00:29:52,637 --> 00:29:54,935
...something much safer
and more efficient...

443
00:29:55,139 --> 00:29:58,939
...than the existing nuclear
fission power plants.

444
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,444
We do not yet have fusion reactors.

445
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:08,380
One day, quite soon, we may.

446
00:30:14,091 --> 00:30:17,492
Orion and Daedalus might go...

447
00:30:17,695 --> 00:30:20,323
...10 percent the speed of light.

448
00:30:21,465 --> 00:30:24,332
So a trip to Alpha Centauri,
4 1 l2 light-years away...

449
00:30:24,535 --> 00:30:28,369
...would take 45 years,
less than a human lifetime.

450
00:30:28,939 --> 00:30:32,773
Such ships could not travel
close enough to the speed of light...

451
00:30:32,977 --> 00:30:35,912
...for the time-slowing effects
of special relativity...

452
00:30:36,113 --> 00:30:37,774
...to become important.

453
00:30:38,349 --> 00:30:41,045
It does not seem likely
that such ships...

454
00:30:41,252 --> 00:30:43,846
...would be built before
the middle of the 21 st century...

455
00:30:44,055 --> 00:30:47,855
...although we could build
an Orion starship now.

456
00:30:48,292 --> 00:30:52,353
For voyages beyond the nearest stars,
something must be added.

457
00:30:52,563 --> 00:30:55,657
Perhaps they could be used
as multigeneration ships...

458
00:30:56,033 --> 00:30:59,025
...so those arriving would be
the remote descendants...

459
00:30:59,236 --> 00:31:02,967
...of those who had originally
set out centuries before.

460
00:31:03,607 --> 00:31:07,634
Or perhaps some safe means
of human hibernation might be found...

461
00:31:07,845 --> 00:31:11,713
...so that space travelers might be
frozen and then thawed out...

462
00:31:11,916 --> 00:31:15,818
...when they arrive at
the destination centuries later.

463
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:20,820
But fast interstellar space flight
approaching the speed of light...

464
00:31:21,025 --> 00:31:22,890
...is much more difficult.

465
00:31:23,094 --> 00:31:25,824
That's an objective
not for a hundred years...

466
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:29,158
...but for a thousand
or for 1 0 thousand...

467
00:31:29,367 --> 00:31:31,835
...but it also is possible.

468
00:31:34,205 --> 00:31:37,174
A kind of interstellar ramjet
has been proposed...

469
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:39,809
...which scoops up
the hydrogen atoms...

470
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:41,944
...which float between the stars...

471
00:31:42,146 --> 00:31:46,207
...accelerates them into an engine
and spits them out the back.

472
00:31:47,051 --> 00:31:49,451
But in deep space,
there is one atom...

473
00:31:49,653 --> 00:31:53,714
...for every 1 0 cubic centimeters
of space.

474
00:31:53,924 --> 00:31:55,391
For the ramjet to work...

475
00:31:55,893 --> 00:31:58,453
...it has to have a frontal scoop...

476
00:31:58,662 --> 00:32:01,529
...hundreds of kilometers across.

477
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:05,997
Reaching relativistic velocities,
the hydrogen atoms will be moving...

478
00:32:06,203 --> 00:32:08,763
...with respect
to the interstellar spaceship...

479
00:32:08,973 --> 00:32:10,998
...at close to the speed of light.

480
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:12,937
If precautions aren't taken...

481
00:32:13,144 --> 00:32:17,706
...the passengers will be fried
by these induced cosmic rays.

482
00:32:17,915 --> 00:32:19,780
There's a proposed solution:

483
00:32:19,984 --> 00:32:23,283
A laser is used to strip
electrons off the atoms...

484
00:32:23,487 --> 00:32:26,718
...and electrically charge them
while they're some distance away.

485
00:32:27,291 --> 00:32:29,919
And an extremely strong
magnetic field...

486
00:32:30,161 --> 00:32:33,426
...is used to deflect
the charged atoms into the scoop...

487
00:32:33,631 --> 00:32:35,258
...and away from the spacecraft.

488
00:32:35,466 --> 00:32:36,763
This is engineering...

489
00:32:36,967 --> 00:32:40,767
...on a scale so far
unprecedented on the Earth.

490
00:32:40,971 --> 00:32:45,567
We are talking of engines
the size of small worlds.

491
00:32:54,985 --> 00:32:59,888
Suppose that the spacecraft is
designed to accelerate at 1 g...

492
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:02,388
...so we'd be comfortable aboard it.

493
00:33:02,593 --> 00:33:05,027
We'd go closer and closer
to the speed of light...

494
00:33:05,229 --> 00:33:07,493
...until the midpoint of the journey.

495
00:33:07,698 --> 00:33:10,258
Then the spacecraft is
turned around...

496
00:33:10,468 --> 00:33:14,029
...and we decelerate at 1 g
to the destination.

497
00:33:14,605 --> 00:33:18,735
For most of the trip, the velocity
would be close to the speed of light...

498
00:33:18,943 --> 00:33:22,106
...and time would
slow down enormously.

499
00:33:22,446 --> 00:33:23,970
By how much?

500
00:33:24,949 --> 00:33:28,385
Barnard's Star could be reached
by such a ship...

501
00:33:28,586 --> 00:33:31,214
...in eight years, ship time.

502
00:33:31,822 --> 00:33:35,781
The center of the Milky Way galaxy
in 21 years.

503
00:33:35,993 --> 00:33:39,861
The Andromeda galaxy in 28 years.

504
00:33:40,397 --> 00:33:42,331
Of course, the people
left behind on the Earth...

505
00:33:42,533 --> 00:33:44,831
...would see things
somewhat differently.

506
00:33:45,102 --> 00:33:47,070
Instead of 21 years to the galaxy...

507
00:33:47,271 --> 00:33:50,832
...they would measure it
as 30,000 years.

508
00:33:51,041 --> 00:33:52,406
When we got back...

509
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:56,068
...very few of our friends
would be around to greet us.

510
00:33:56,914 --> 00:33:58,677
In principle, such a journey...

511
00:33:58,883 --> 00:34:03,286
...mounting the decimal points closer
and closer to the speed of light...

512
00:34:03,487 --> 00:34:07,253
...would even permit us to
circumnavigate the known universe...

513
00:34:07,458 --> 00:34:10,518
...in 56 years, ship time.

514
00:34:11,462 --> 00:34:15,558
We would return tens
of billions of years...

515
00:34:15,766 --> 00:34:17,757
...in the far future...

516
00:34:17,968 --> 00:34:21,028
...with the Earth a charred cinder...

517
00:34:21,238 --> 00:34:23,706
...and the sun dead.

518
00:34:24,341 --> 00:34:27,742
Relativistic space flight makes
the universe accessible...

519
00:34:27,945 --> 00:34:30,311
...to advanced civilizations...

520
00:34:30,514 --> 00:34:32,709
...but only to those
who go on the journey...

521
00:34:32,917 --> 00:34:35,283
...not to those who stay home.

522
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:40,454
These designs are probably further...

523
00:34:40,658 --> 00:34:44,389
...from the actual interstellar
spacecraft of the future...

524
00:34:45,596 --> 00:34:48,394
...than Leonardo's models are...

525
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:51,932
...from the supersonic transports
of the present.

526
00:34:52,503 --> 00:34:54,368
But if we do not destroy ourselves...

527
00:34:54,572 --> 00:34:59,475
...I believe that we will,
one day, venture to the stars.

528
00:35:00,144 --> 00:35:02,704
When our solar system
is all explored...

529
00:35:02,913 --> 00:35:06,041
...the planets of other stars
will beckon.

530
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:44,048
Space travel and time travel
are connected.

531
00:35:45,189 --> 00:35:47,123
To travel fast into space...

532
00:35:47,324 --> 00:35:50,521
...is to travel fast into the future.

533
00:35:53,397 --> 00:35:57,561
We travel into the future,
although slowly, all the time.

534
00:35:57,768 --> 00:36:02,068
But what about the past?
Could we journey into yesterday?

535
00:36:02,272 --> 00:36:05,400
Many physicists think this is
fundamentally impossible...

536
00:36:05,609 --> 00:36:07,941
...that we could
not build a device...

537
00:36:08,145 --> 00:36:10,875
...which would carry us
backwards into time.

538
00:36:11,081 --> 00:36:14,482
Some say that even if we were
to build such a device...

539
00:36:14,685 --> 00:36:15,947
...it wouldn't do much good.

540
00:36:16,153 --> 00:36:18,678
We couldn't significantly
affect the past.

541
00:36:18,889 --> 00:36:22,552
For example, suppose you
traveled into the past...

542
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,853
...and somehow or other prevented...

543
00:36:25,062 --> 00:36:27,860
...your own parents from meeting.

544
00:36:28,065 --> 00:36:31,626
Why, then you would probably
never have been born...

545
00:36:31,835 --> 00:36:33,860
...which is something
of a contradiction, isn't it...

546
00:36:34,071 --> 00:36:36,198
...since you are clearly there.

547
00:36:36,807 --> 00:36:38,138
Other people think that...

548
00:36:38,342 --> 00:36:41,470
...the two alternative histories
have equal validity...

549
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:45,080
...that they're parallel threads,
skeins of time...

550
00:36:45,282 --> 00:36:47,842
...that they could exist side by side.

551
00:36:51,722 --> 00:36:54,247
The history in which
you were never born...

552
00:36:54,458 --> 00:36:57,427
...and the history that
you know all about.

553
00:36:57,661 --> 00:37:00,858
Perhaps time itself has
many potential dimensions...

554
00:37:01,065 --> 00:37:04,330
...despite the fact that
we are condemned to experience...

555
00:37:04,535 --> 00:37:06,730
...only one of those dimensions.

556
00:37:07,371 --> 00:37:10,636
Now, suppose you could go back
into the past...

557
00:37:10,841 --> 00:37:14,299
...and really change it by,
let's say something like...

558
00:37:14,511 --> 00:37:19,005
...persuading Queen Isabella not
to bankroll Christopher Columbus.

559
00:37:19,216 --> 00:37:21,480
Then you would have set into motion...

560
00:37:21,685 --> 00:37:24,711
...a different sequence
of historical events...

561
00:37:24,922 --> 00:37:27,982
...which those people
you left behind you in our time...

562
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:30,353
...would never get to know about.

563
00:37:30,561 --> 00:37:33,291
If that kind of time travel
were possible...

564
00:37:33,497 --> 00:37:36,694
...then every imaginable sequence...

565
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,868
...of alternative history...

566
00:37:39,069 --> 00:37:41,264
...might in some sense really exist.

567
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:44,298
Would it be possible
for a time traveler...

568
00:37:44,508 --> 00:37:47,875
...to change the course of history
in a major way?

569
00:37:48,078 --> 00:37:50,308
Well, let's think about that.

570
00:37:53,884 --> 00:37:56,148
History consists for the most part...

571
00:37:56,353 --> 00:38:00,414
...of a complex multitude
of deeply interwoven threads...

572
00:38:00,624 --> 00:38:03,286
...biological, economic
and social forces...

573
00:38:03,494 --> 00:38:05,985
...that are not so easily unraveled.

574
00:38:07,264 --> 00:38:11,894
The ancient Greeks imagined the course
of human events to be a tapestry...

575
00:38:12,102 --> 00:38:15,868
...created by three goddesses:
the Fates.

576
00:38:17,541 --> 00:38:21,773
Random minor events generally
have no long-range consequences.

577
00:38:21,979 --> 00:38:25,176
But some which occur
at critical junctures...

578
00:38:25,382 --> 00:38:27,907
...may alter the weave of history.

579
00:38:28,118 --> 00:38:31,110
There may be cases where
profound changes can be made...

580
00:38:31,321 --> 00:38:33,812
...by relatively trivial adjustments.

581
00:38:34,024 --> 00:38:38,791
The further in the past such an event
is, the more powerful its influence.

582
00:38:39,296 --> 00:38:42,754
What if our time traveler had
persuaded Queen Isabella that...

583
00:38:42,966 --> 00:38:44,866
...Columbus' geography was wrong?

584
00:38:45,068 --> 00:38:49,266
Almost certainly, some other European
would have sailed to the New World.

585
00:38:49,473 --> 00:38:51,134
There were many inducements:

586
00:38:51,341 --> 00:38:54,401
The lure of the spice trade,
improvements in navigation...

587
00:38:54,611 --> 00:38:57,045
...competition among
rival European powers.

588
00:38:57,247 --> 00:39:01,149
The discovery of America
around 1 500 was inevitable.

589
00:39:01,351 --> 00:39:04,752
Of course, there wouldn't be any
postage stamps showing Columbus...

590
00:39:04,955 --> 00:39:07,890
...and the Republic of Colombia
would have another name.

591
00:39:08,091 --> 00:39:12,084
But the big picture would have
turned out more or less the same.

592
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:19,897
In order to affect
the future profoundly...

593
00:39:20,103 --> 00:39:22,663
...a time traveler
has to pick and choose.

594
00:39:22,873 --> 00:39:26,331
He'd probably have to intervene
in a number of events...

595
00:39:26,543 --> 00:39:29,239
...which are
very carefully selected...

596
00:39:29,446 --> 00:39:34,281
...so he could change
the weave of history.

597
00:39:34,685 --> 00:39:37,210
It's a lovely fantasy...

598
00:39:37,421 --> 00:39:41,357
...to explore those other worlds
that never were.

599
00:39:43,861 --> 00:39:47,456
If you had H.G. Wells' time machine...

600
00:39:47,664 --> 00:39:50,690
...maybe you could understand
how history really works.

601
00:39:50,901 --> 00:39:53,768
If an apparently pivotal person
had never lived...

602
00:39:53,971 --> 00:39:58,135
...Paul the Apostle or Peter the Great
or Pythagoras...

603
00:39:58,342 --> 00:40:01,038
...how different would
the world really be?

604
00:40:01,845 --> 00:40:03,938
What if the scientific tradition...

605
00:40:04,147 --> 00:40:06,911
...of the ancient Ionian Greeks...

606
00:40:07,117 --> 00:40:09,779
...had prospered and flourished?

607
00:40:09,987 --> 00:40:12,854
It would have required
many social factors at the time...

608
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:14,785
...to have been different...

609
00:40:14,992 --> 00:40:17,426
...including the common feeling...

610
00:40:17,628 --> 00:40:20,324
...that slavery was right and natural.

611
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:24,091
But what if that light
that had dawned...

612
00:40:24,301 --> 00:40:27,668
...on the eastern Mediterranean
some 2500 years ago...

613
00:40:27,871 --> 00:40:29,839
...had not flickered out?

614
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:33,339
What if scientific method
and experiment...

615
00:40:33,543 --> 00:40:35,534
...had been vigorously pursued...

616
00:40:35,746 --> 00:40:38,010
...2000 years before
the industrial revolution...

617
00:40:38,215 --> 00:40:40,183
...our industrial revolution?

618
00:40:40,384 --> 00:40:44,445
What if the power of this new mode
of thought, the scientific method...

619
00:40:44,655 --> 00:40:46,953
...had been generally appreciated?

620
00:40:47,324 --> 00:40:51,055
I think we might have saved
1 0 or 20 centuries.

621
00:40:51,261 --> 00:40:53,957
Perhaps the contributions
that Leonardo made...

622
00:40:54,164 --> 00:40:56,997
...would have been made
1 000 years earlier...

623
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,000
...and the contributions
of Einstein 500 years ago.

624
00:41:01,204 --> 00:41:03,331
Not that it would have
been those people...

625
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,974
...who would've made
those contributions...

626
00:41:06,176 --> 00:41:09,168
...because they lived only
in our timeline.

627
00:41:09,746 --> 00:41:12,681
If the Ionians had won...

628
00:41:12,883 --> 00:41:16,876
...we might by now, I think,
be going to the stars.

629
00:41:17,087 --> 00:41:21,820
We might at this moment have
the first survey ships...

630
00:41:22,025 --> 00:41:26,689
...returning with astonishing results
from Alpha Centauri...

631
00:41:26,897 --> 00:41:31,493
...and Barnard's Star,
Sirius and Tau Ceti.

632
00:41:31,702 --> 00:41:35,001
There would now be great fleets...

633
00:41:35,205 --> 00:41:37,173
...of interstellar transports...

634
00:41:37,374 --> 00:41:39,865
...being constructed in Earth orbit...

635
00:41:40,077 --> 00:41:43,069
...small, unmanned survey ships...

636
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,738
...liners for immigrants, perhaps...

637
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:48,349
...great trading ships...

638
00:41:48,552 --> 00:41:52,010
...to ply the spaces
between the stars.

639
00:41:52,489 --> 00:41:55,686
On all these ships
there would be symbols...

640
00:41:55,892 --> 00:41:58,622
...and inscriptions on the sides.

641
00:41:58,829 --> 00:42:01,093
The inscriptions,
if we looked closely...

642
00:42:01,298 --> 00:42:03,926
...would be written in Greek.

643
00:42:04,434 --> 00:42:05,765
The symbol...

644
00:42:05,969 --> 00:42:09,427
...perhaps, would be the dodecahedron.

645
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:14,269
And the inscription on the sides
of the ships to the stars...

646
00:42:14,478 --> 00:42:15,945
...something like:

647
00:42:16,146 --> 00:42:20,879
"Starship Theodorus
of the Planet Earth."

648
00:42:23,887 --> 00:42:26,685
If you were a really
ambitious time traveler...

649
00:42:29,893 --> 00:42:32,657
...you might not dally
with human history...

650
00:42:32,863 --> 00:42:35,491
...or even pause to examine
the evolution on Earth.

651
00:42:35,699 --> 00:42:37,929
Instead, you would journey back...

652
00:42:38,135 --> 00:42:39,534
...to witness the origin
of our solar system...

653
00:42:40,003 --> 00:42:44,531
...from the gas and dust
between the stars.

654
00:42:45,709 --> 00:42:47,142
Five billion years ago...

655
00:42:47,344 --> 00:42:50,939
...an interstellar cloud was
collapsing to form our solar system.

656
00:42:51,148 --> 00:42:54,379
Most clumps of matter
gravitated towards the center...

657
00:42:54,584 --> 00:42:57,144
...and were destined
to form the sun.

658
00:42:57,354 --> 00:43:01,586
Smaller peripheral clumps
would become the planets.

659
00:43:01,792 --> 00:43:06,195
Long ago, there was a kind of
natural selection among the worlds.

660
00:43:06,396 --> 00:43:10,594
Those on highly elliptical orbits
tended to collide and be destroyed...

661
00:43:10,801 --> 00:43:14,396
...but planets in circular orbits
tended to survive.

662
00:43:14,604 --> 00:43:16,868
But if events had been
a little different...

663
00:43:17,074 --> 00:43:18,735
...the Earth would never have formed...

664
00:43:18,942 --> 00:43:22,901
...and another planet at another
distance from the sun would be around.

665
00:43:23,113 --> 00:43:25,377
We owe the existence of our world...

666
00:43:25,582 --> 00:43:29,416
...to random collisions
in a long-vanished cloud.

667
00:43:32,255 --> 00:43:35,315
Soon, the central mass
became very hot.

668
00:43:35,525 --> 00:43:39,359
Thermonuclear reactions were initiated
and the sun turned on...

669
00:43:39,563 --> 00:43:42,430
...flooding the solar system
with light.

670
00:43:44,801 --> 00:43:46,769
But the growing smaller lumps...

671
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:49,200
...would never achieve
such high temperatures...

672
00:43:49,406 --> 00:43:52,239
...and would never generate
thermonuclear reactions.

673
00:43:52,442 --> 00:43:56,173
They would become
the Earth and the other planets...

674
00:43:56,379 --> 00:44:00,611
...heated not from within,
but mainly by the distant sun.

675
00:44:05,288 --> 00:44:07,085
The accretion continued until...

676
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:10,555
...almost all the gas and dust
and small worldlets...

677
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:14,161
...were swept up
by the surviving planets.

678
00:44:16,533 --> 00:44:18,831
Our time traveler would witness...

679
00:44:19,035 --> 00:44:21,970
...the collisions
that made the worlds.

680
00:44:28,145 --> 00:44:30,170
Except for the comets and asteroids...

681
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:33,008
...the chaos of the early
solar system was reduced...

682
00:44:33,216 --> 00:44:35,548
...to a remarkable simplicity:

683
00:44:35,752 --> 00:44:39,586
Nine or so principal planets
in almost circular orbits...

684
00:44:39,789 --> 00:44:41,848
...and a few dozen moons.

685
00:44:46,329 --> 00:44:49,264
Now, let's take a different look.

686
00:44:50,901 --> 00:44:53,369
If we view the solar system edge on...

687
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:55,834
...and move the sun
off-screen to the left...

688
00:44:56,039 --> 00:44:58,701
...we see that
the small terrestrial planets...

689
00:44:58,909 --> 00:45:02,538
...the ones about as massive as Earth,
tend to be close to the sun.

690
00:45:02,746 --> 00:45:06,580
The big Jupiter-like planets tend
to be much further from the sun.

691
00:45:06,783 --> 00:45:09,650
But is that the way it has to be?

692
00:45:10,854 --> 00:45:12,515
Computer studies suggest...

693
00:45:12,722 --> 00:45:15,486
...that there may be many
similar systems about stars...

694
00:45:15,692 --> 00:45:20,061
...with the terrestrials in close
and the Jovian planets further away.

695
00:45:23,934 --> 00:45:27,665
But some systems might have Jovians
and terrestrials mixed together.

696
00:45:27,871 --> 00:45:32,399
There may be great worlds
like Jupiter looming in other skies.

697
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:37,669
Rarely, the Jovian planets
may form close to the star...

698
00:45:37,881 --> 00:45:42,215
...the terrestrials trailing away
towards interstellar space.

699
00:45:43,553 --> 00:45:45,544
Our familiar arrangement of planets...

700
00:45:45,755 --> 00:45:48,519
...is only one,
perhaps typical, case...

701
00:45:48,725 --> 00:45:52,786
...in the vast expanse of systems.

702
00:45:52,996 --> 00:45:57,626
Often, one fledgling planet
accumulates so much gas and dust...

703
00:45:57,834 --> 00:46:00,029
...that thermonuclear reactions
do occur.

704
00:46:00,237 --> 00:46:02,330
It becomes a second sun.

705
00:46:02,539 --> 00:46:05,372
A binary star system has formed.

706
00:46:09,879 --> 00:46:13,781
From most of these worlds,
the vistas will be dazzling.

707
00:46:13,984 --> 00:46:16,350
Not one of them will be
identical to the Earth.

708
00:46:16,553 --> 00:46:20,922
A few will be hospitable.
Many will appear hostile.

709
00:46:22,325 --> 00:46:24,350
Where there are two suns in the sky...

710
00:46:24,561 --> 00:46:28,258
...every object will cast two shadows.

711
00:46:32,435 --> 00:46:35,063
What wonders are waiting for us...

712
00:46:35,272 --> 00:46:37,638
...on the planets of the nearby stars?

713
00:46:37,841 --> 00:46:40,708
Are there radically
different kinds of worlds...

714
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:43,970
...unimaginably exotic forms of life?

715
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:50,151
Perhaps in another century or two...

716
00:46:50,353 --> 00:46:52,344
...when our solar system
is all explored...

717
00:46:52,555 --> 00:46:55,786
...we will also have put
our own planet in order.

718
00:46:55,992 --> 00:46:59,450
Then we will set sail for the stars...

719
00:46:59,663 --> 00:47:02,325
...and the beckoning worlds
around them.

720
00:47:05,769 --> 00:47:08,897
In that day, our machines
and our descendants...

721
00:47:09,105 --> 00:47:12,802
...approaching the speed of light,
will skim the light-years...

722
00:47:13,009 --> 00:47:17,639
...leaping ahead through time,
seeking new worlds.

723
00:47:17,847 --> 00:47:21,374
Einstein has shown us
that it's possible.

724
00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:24,712
We will journey simultaneously...

725
00:47:24,921 --> 00:47:28,322
...to distant planets
and to the far future.

726
00:47:29,125 --> 00:47:30,820
Some worlds, like this one...

727
00:47:31,027 --> 00:47:34,292
...will look out onto
a vast gaseous nebula...

728
00:47:34,497 --> 00:47:36,226
...the remains of a star...

729
00:47:36,433 --> 00:47:39,561
...that once was and is no longer.

730
00:47:42,072 --> 00:47:44,597
In all those skies,
rich and distant...

731
00:47:44,808 --> 00:47:47,333
...and exotic constellations...

732
00:47:47,544 --> 00:47:51,503
...there may be a faint yellow star...

733
00:47:51,715 --> 00:47:54,616
...perhaps barely visible
to the naked eye...

734
00:47:54,818 --> 00:47:57,651
...perhaps seen only
through the telescope.

735
00:47:57,854 --> 00:48:01,722
The home star of a fleet
of interstellar transports...

736
00:48:01,925 --> 00:48:04,086
...exploring this tiny region...

737
00:48:04,294 --> 00:48:07,388
...of the great Milky Way galaxy.

738
00:48:07,831 --> 00:48:12,097
The themes of space and time
are intertwined.

739
00:48:12,302 --> 00:48:15,294
Worlds and stars, like people...

740
00:48:15,505 --> 00:48:19,305
...are born, live and die.

741
00:48:19,509 --> 00:48:22,239
The lifetime of a human being
is measured in decades.

742
00:48:22,445 --> 00:48:24,675
But the lifetime of the sun...

743
00:48:24,881 --> 00:48:27,714
...is a hundred million times longer.

744
00:48:29,886 --> 00:48:32,446
Matter is much older than life.

745
00:48:32,655 --> 00:48:35,886
Billions of years before
the sun and Earth even formed...

746
00:48:36,092 --> 00:48:39,459
...atoms were being synthesized
in the insides of hot stars...

747
00:48:39,662 --> 00:48:44,031
...and then returned to space
when the stars blew themselves up.

748
00:48:44,234 --> 00:48:47,567
Newly formed planets were
made of this stellar debris.

749
00:48:47,771 --> 00:48:52,071
The Earth and every living thing
are made of star stuff.

750
00:48:56,913 --> 00:49:00,747
But how slowly, in our human
perspective, life evolved...

751
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:05,387
...from the molecules of the early
oceans to the first bacteria.

752
00:49:09,159 --> 00:49:12,094
Evolution is not immediately
obvious to everybody...

753
00:49:12,295 --> 00:49:15,594
...because it moves
so slowly and takes so long.

754
00:49:15,799 --> 00:49:18,927
How can creatures who
live for only 70 years...

755
00:49:19,135 --> 00:49:22,866
...detect events that
take 70 million years to unfold?

756
00:49:23,072 --> 00:49:24,869
Or 4 billion?

757
00:49:29,913 --> 00:49:32,279
By the time
one-celled animals had evolved...

758
00:49:32,482 --> 00:49:35,713
...the history of life
on Earth was half over.

759
00:49:40,156 --> 00:49:42,920
Not very far along to us,
you might think...

760
00:49:43,126 --> 00:49:45,788
...but by now almost all
the basic chemistry of life...

761
00:49:45,995 --> 00:49:48,020
...had been established.

762
00:49:49,265 --> 00:49:51,233
Forget our human time perspective.

763
00:49:51,434 --> 00:49:53,425
From the point of view of a star...

764
00:49:53,636 --> 00:49:56,901
...evolution was weaving
intricate new patterns...

765
00:49:57,106 --> 00:50:01,065
...from the star stuff on
the planet Earth, and very rapidly.

766
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:06,476
Most evolutionary lines
became extinct.

767
00:50:06,683 --> 00:50:08,776
Many lines became stagnant.

768
00:50:08,985 --> 00:50:10,976
If things had gone
a bit differently...

769
00:50:11,187 --> 00:50:13,280
...a small change of climate,
say, or...

770
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:14,548
...a new mutation...

771
00:50:14,757 --> 00:50:18,158
...or the accidental death
of a different humble organism...

772
00:50:18,361 --> 00:50:22,559
...the entire future history of life
might have been very different.

773
00:50:25,235 --> 00:50:28,136
Maybe the line to an intelligent
technological species...

774
00:50:28,338 --> 00:50:31,000
...would have passed through worms.

775
00:50:33,843 --> 00:50:36,004
Maybe the present masters
of the planet...

776
00:50:36,212 --> 00:50:39,875
...would have had ancestors
who were tunicates.

777
00:50:42,352 --> 00:50:43,876
We might not have evolved.

778
00:50:44,087 --> 00:50:47,113
Someone else,
someone very different...

779
00:50:47,323 --> 00:50:52,158
...would be here now in our stead,
maybe pondering their origins.

780
00:50:54,264 --> 00:50:56,357
But that's not what happened.

781
00:50:56,566 --> 00:50:59,626
There's a particular sequence
of environmental accidents...

782
00:50:59,836 --> 00:51:02,964
...and random mutations
in the hereditary material.

783
00:51:03,172 --> 00:51:06,869
One particular timeline
for life on Earth...

784
00:51:07,076 --> 00:51:08,907
...in this universe.

785
00:51:12,882 --> 00:51:16,716
As a result, the dominant organisms
on the planet today...

786
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,854
...come from fish.

787
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:24,387
Along the way, many more species
became extinct than now exist.

788
00:51:24,594 --> 00:51:27,825
If history had
a slightly different weave...

789
00:51:28,031 --> 00:51:32,491
...some of those extinct organisms
might have survived and prospered.

790
00:51:33,303 --> 00:51:36,466
But occasionally, a creature
thought to have become extinct...

791
00:51:36,673 --> 00:51:38,573
...hundreds of millions
of years ago...

792
00:51:38,775 --> 00:51:41,642
...turns out to be alive and well.

793
00:51:41,844 --> 00:51:44,506
The coelacanth, for example.

794
00:51:46,616 --> 00:51:51,451
For 3 1/2 billion years, life had
lived exclusively in the water.

795
00:51:51,654 --> 00:51:54,088
But now, in a great
breathtaking adventure...

796
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:55,518
...it took to the land.

797
00:51:55,725 --> 00:51:57,852
But if things had gone
a little differently...

798
00:51:58,061 --> 00:52:00,791
...the dominant species might
still be in the ocean...

799
00:52:00,997 --> 00:52:05,366
...or developed spaceships to
carry them off the planet altogether.

800
00:52:11,007 --> 00:52:13,066
From our ancestors, the reptiles...

801
00:52:13,276 --> 00:52:15,642
...there developed
many successful lines...

802
00:52:15,845 --> 00:52:18,405
...including the dinosaurs.

803
00:52:18,715 --> 00:52:21,684
Some were fast, dexterous
and intelligent.

804
00:52:21,884 --> 00:52:23,852
A visitor from
another world or time...

805
00:52:24,053 --> 00:52:26,817
...might have thought them
the wave of the future.

806
00:52:27,023 --> 00:52:31,585
But after nearly 200 million years,
they were suddenly all wiped out.

807
00:52:31,794 --> 00:52:34,558
Perhaps it was a great meteorite
colliding with the Earth...

808
00:52:34,764 --> 00:52:37,494
...spewing debris into the air,
blotting out the sun...

809
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:40,225
...and killing the plants
that the dinosaurs ate.

810
00:52:40,436 --> 00:52:44,930
I wonder when they first sensed
that something was wrong.

811
00:52:47,043 --> 00:52:50,809
The successors of the dinosaurs
came from the same reptilian stock...

812
00:52:51,014 --> 00:52:55,451
...but they survived the catastrophe
that destroyed their cousins.

813
00:52:58,054 --> 00:53:00,750
Again, there were many branches
which became extinct.

814
00:53:00,957 --> 00:53:03,255
And had events been
a little different...

815
00:53:03,459 --> 00:53:06,917
...those branches might have led
to the dominant form today.

816
00:53:09,799 --> 00:53:12,859
For 40 million years, a visitor
would not have been impressed...

817
00:53:13,069 --> 00:53:15,196
...by these timid little creatures...

818
00:53:15,405 --> 00:53:19,034
...but they led to all
the familiar mammals of today.

819
00:53:21,544 --> 00:53:24,513
And that includes the primates.

820
00:53:25,415 --> 00:53:28,782
About 20 million years ago,
a space time traveler...

821
00:53:28,985 --> 00:53:31,613
...might have recognized
these guys as promising...

822
00:53:31,821 --> 00:53:35,416
...bright, quick, agile,
sociable, curious.

823
00:53:35,658 --> 00:53:38,718
Their ancestors were once
atoms made in stars...

824
00:53:38,928 --> 00:53:41,761
...then simple molecules,
single cells...

825
00:53:41,964 --> 00:53:44,228
...polyps stuck to the ocean floor...

826
00:53:44,434 --> 00:53:47,835
...fish, amphibians, reptiles, shrews.

827
00:53:48,237 --> 00:53:52,640
But then they came down
from the trees and stood upright.

828
00:53:52,842 --> 00:53:55,208
They grew an enormous brain...

829
00:53:55,411 --> 00:53:58,539
...they developed culture,
invented tools...

830
00:53:58,748 --> 00:54:00,807
...domesticated fire.

831
00:54:04,353 --> 00:54:07,015
They discovered language and writing.

832
00:54:07,223 --> 00:54:09,214
They developed agriculture.

833
00:54:09,425 --> 00:54:13,020
They built cities and forged metal.

834
00:54:14,797 --> 00:54:18,631
And ultimately,
they set out for the stars...

835
00:54:18,835 --> 00:54:23,169
...from which they had come
5 billion years earlier.

836
00:54:25,575 --> 00:54:27,099
We are star stuff...

837
00:54:27,310 --> 00:54:30,711
...which has taken its destiny
into its own hands.

838
00:54:33,516 --> 00:54:35,643
The loom of time and space...

839
00:54:35,852 --> 00:54:39,481
...works the most astonishing
transformations of matter.

840
00:54:40,656 --> 00:54:43,648
Our own planet is only a tiny part...

841
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:45,987
...of the vast cosmic tapestry...

842
00:54:46,195 --> 00:54:50,928
...a starry fabric
of worlds yet untold.

843
00:54:57,807 --> 00:55:01,834
Those worlds in space
are as countless...

844
00:55:02,044 --> 00:55:05,741
...as all the grains of sand
on all the beaches of the Earth.

845
00:55:06,415 --> 00:55:09,350
Each of those worlds
is as real as ours.

846
00:55:09,552 --> 00:55:12,043
In every one of them,
there's a succession of...

847
00:55:12,255 --> 00:55:16,885
...incidents, events, occurrences
which influence its future.

848
00:55:17,093 --> 00:55:20,688
Countless worlds,
numberless moments...

849
00:55:20,897 --> 00:55:24,355
...an immensity of space and time.

850
00:55:24,567 --> 00:55:27,365
And our small planet,
at this moment...

851
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:32,007
...here, we face
a critical branchpoint in history.

852
00:55:32,208 --> 00:55:35,109
What we do with our world right now...

853
00:55:35,311 --> 00:55:37,609
...will propagate down
through the centuries...

854
00:55:37,814 --> 00:55:41,215
...and powerfully affect
the destiny of our descendants.

855
00:55:41,417 --> 00:55:45,217
It is well within our power
to destroy our civilization...

856
00:55:45,421 --> 00:55:48,254
...and perhaps our species as well.

857
00:55:48,457 --> 00:55:50,857
If we capitulate to superstition...

858
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:53,426
...or greed or stupidity...

859
00:55:53,629 --> 00:55:57,565
...we can plunge our world into
a darkness deeper than the time...

860
00:55:57,767 --> 00:56:02,101
...between the collapse of classical
civilization and Italian Renaissance.

861
00:56:02,305 --> 00:56:04,569
But we are also capable...

862
00:56:04,774 --> 00:56:07,265
...of using our compassion
and our intelligence...

863
00:56:07,476 --> 00:56:10,070
...our technology and our wealth...

864
00:56:10,279 --> 00:56:12,747
...to make an abundant
and meaningful life...

865
00:56:12,949 --> 00:56:15,247
...for every inhabitant
of this planet...

866
00:56:15,451 --> 00:56:19,945
...to enhance enormously
our understanding of the universe...

867
00:56:20,356 --> 00:56:23,416
...and to carry us to the stars.

868
00:56:39,275 --> 00:56:40,902
In our motorbike sequence...

869
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:43,601
...we showed how
the landscape might look...

870
00:56:43,813 --> 00:56:46,543
...if we barreled through it
at close to light speed.

871
00:56:46,749 --> 00:56:49,684
Since then,
inspired by this sequence...

872
00:56:49,886 --> 00:56:53,481
...Ping-Kang Hsiung
at Carnegie Mellon University...

873
00:56:53,689 --> 00:56:55,623
...produced an exact
computer animation.

874
00:56:56,125 --> 00:56:59,356
This is what you'd see if you
traveled at ordinary speeds...

875
00:56:59,562 --> 00:57:01,792
...through this red and white lattice.

876
00:57:01,998 --> 00:57:03,829
But this is how it would appear...

877
00:57:04,033 --> 00:57:07,969
...if you were traveling
at close to the speed of light.

878
00:57:08,838 --> 00:57:12,865
We're probably many centuries away
from traveling close to light speed...

879
00:57:13,075 --> 00:57:15,942
...and experiencing time dilation.

880
00:57:16,145 --> 00:57:19,012
But even then,
it might not be fast enough...

881
00:57:19,215 --> 00:57:22,616
...if we wanted to travel
to some distant place in the galaxy...

882
00:57:22,818 --> 00:57:25,548
...and then come back to Earth
in our own epoch.

883
00:57:26,055 --> 00:57:29,149
Some years after completing Cosmos...

884
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:33,886
...I took time out from
my scientific work to write a novel.

885
00:57:34,397 --> 00:57:35,989
A novel about travel...

886
00:57:36,198 --> 00:57:39,395
...to the center
of the Milky Way galaxy.

887
00:57:39,669 --> 00:57:43,002
I was willing to imagine
beings and civilizations...

888
00:57:43,205 --> 00:57:45,230
...far more advanced than we...

889
00:57:45,441 --> 00:57:48,740
...but I wasn't willing
to ignore the laws of physics.

890
00:57:48,978 --> 00:57:53,540
Was there, even in principle,
a way to get very quickly...

891
00:57:53,749 --> 00:57:56,718
...to 30,000 light-years from Earth?

892
00:57:56,919 --> 00:57:58,784
So I asked my friend...

893
00:57:58,988 --> 00:58:02,219
...Kip Thorne of the California
Institute of Technology.

894
00:58:02,425 --> 00:58:05,451
He's a leading expert
on the nature of space and time.

895
00:58:05,661 --> 00:58:08,129
Kip thought about it for a while...

896
00:58:08,331 --> 00:58:11,425
...and then answered with
about 50 lines of equations...

897
00:58:11,634 --> 00:58:14,364
...which showed that
a really advanced civilization...

898
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:18,506
...might establish
and hold open wormholes...

899
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:24,407
...which we might think of as tubes
through the fourth dimension...

900
00:58:24,613 --> 00:58:27,446
...which connect the Earth
with another place...

901
00:58:27,650 --> 00:58:31,108
...without having to traverse
the intervening distance.

902
00:58:31,354 --> 00:58:35,222
Something like crawling
through a wormhole in an apple.

903
00:58:35,658 --> 00:58:37,523
I was happy with this result...

904
00:58:37,727 --> 00:58:41,219
...and used it as
a key plot device in Contact.

905
00:58:41,697 --> 00:58:43,722
But such wormholes through space...

906
00:58:43,933 --> 00:58:46,868
...would also be time machines,
it seemed to me.

907
00:58:47,069 --> 00:58:49,936
And I used that notion
in my novel Contact as well.

908
00:58:50,406 --> 00:58:54,502
Kip Thorne and his colleagues
later proved, or so it seemed...

909
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:57,178
...that time travel
of this sort was possible.

910
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:59,712
Here, look at this.

911
00:59:00,916 --> 00:59:03,544
The key question being explored now...

912
00:59:03,753 --> 00:59:07,211
...is whether such time travel
can be done consistently...

913
00:59:07,423 --> 00:59:11,723
...with causes preceding effects, say,
rather than following them.

914
00:59:11,927 --> 00:59:13,394
Does nature contrive it...

915
00:59:13,596 --> 00:59:16,827
...so that even with a time machine,
you can't intervene...

916
00:59:17,033 --> 00:59:20,127
...to prevent your own conception,
for example?

917
00:59:20,336 --> 00:59:23,362
Even if time travel of this sort
is really possible...

918
00:59:23,572 --> 00:59:26,439
...it's far in
our technological future.

919
00:59:26,642 --> 00:59:30,601
But maybe other beings
much more advanced than we...

920
00:59:30,813 --> 00:59:33,748
...are voyaging to the far future
and the remote past...

921
00:59:33,949 --> 00:59:36,941
...not a measly 40 years ago
on Earth...

922
00:59:37,153 --> 00:59:39,644
...but to witness
the death of the sun, say...

923
00:59:39,855 --> 00:59:42,050
...or the origin of the cosmos.
