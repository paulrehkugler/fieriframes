00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:08,394
May I, Alma?

175
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:12,299
I like to see
who I'm talking to.

176
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:20,006
Here.

177
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,314
(Alma laughs softly)

178
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:32,751
There you are.

179
00:17:32,753 --> 00:17:34,622
That's better.

180
00:17:35,823 --> 00:17:39,291
Does your mother
have brown eyes?

181
00:17:39,293 --> 00:17:41,126
Green.

182
00:17:41,128 --> 00:17:44,129
Do you look very much like her?

183
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:46,331
I don't know. I think so.

184
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,734
Do you have a photograph?

185
00:17:48,736 --> 00:17:50,736
Yes.

186
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:52,304
Would you let me see it?

187
00:17:52,306 --> 00:17:55,044
Not here. At home.

188
00:17:57,178 --> 00:17:59,745
Carry it with you.

189
00:17:59,747 --> 00:18:03,185
Always carry her with you.

190
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:08,720
Where's yours?

191
00:18:08,722 --> 00:18:10,189
Your mother.

192
00:18:10,191 --> 00:18:12,595
She's here in the canvas.

193
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,535
- What do you mean?
- Hmm.

194
00:18:21,537 --> 00:18:25,408
You can sew almost anything
into the canvas of a coat.

195
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:30,309
Secrets.

196
00:18:30,311 --> 00:18:35,650
Coins, words, little messages.

197
00:18:35,652 --> 00:18:38,353
When I was a boy,
I started to hide things

198
00:18:38,355 --> 00:18:41,389
in the linings of the garments,

199
00:18:41,391 --> 00:18:44,128
things that only I knew
were there.

200
00:18:45,529 --> 00:18:49,296
And over my breast, I have
a lock of my mother's hair,

201
00:18:49,298 --> 00:18:52,269
to keep her close to me always.

202
00:18:53,403 --> 00:18:55,269
She was quite
a remarkable woman.

203
00:18:55,271 --> 00:18:57,305
She taught me my trade.

204
00:18:57,307 --> 00:19:01,146
So I try to never be
without her.

205
00:19:05,849 --> 00:19:09,386
You must love her very much.

when I was 16 years old.</i>

ALMA:
Beautiful.

216
00:20:06,745 --> 00:20:09,713
REYNOLDS: 'Twas for her second
husband, for the wedding.

217
00:20:09,715 --> 00:20:12,550
My father had died
many years before.

218
00:20:12,552 --> 00:20:16,320
Our nanny,
the evil Miss Blackwood...

219
00:20:16,322 --> 00:20:18,991
Black Death,
we used to call her...

220
00:20:18,993 --> 00:20:20,391
because of superstition,

221
00:20:20,393 --> 00:20:22,461
she refused to help me
sew the dress,

222
00:20:22,463 --> 00:20:25,464
as she believed it would
bring her bad fortune,

223
00:20:25,466 --> 00:20:27,599
to never be a bride.

224
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,600
Not that anyone
would've had her.

225
00:20:29,602 --> 00:20:31,336
And she seemed ancient to us.

226
00:20:31,338 --> 00:20:33,338
I have no idea
how old she actually was.

227
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,309
And monstrously ugly.

228
00:20:36,311 --> 00:20:39,445
So I worked alone
for months and months,

229
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:44,817
hunched over, sewing
and sweating and sewing.

230
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:47,453
And the Black Death
never married anyway.

231
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:49,722
All the help I could have had
from her.

232
00:20:49,724 --> 00:20:53,629
'Twas my sister, Cyril,
came to my rescue in the end.

233
00:20:55,362 --> 00:20:57,863
There are endless
superstitions

234
00:20:57,865 --> 00:21:00,333
when making a wedding dress.

235
00:21:00,335 --> 00:21:01,968
Young girls afraid
they'll never marry

236
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,504
if they touch one.

237
00:21:03,506 --> 00:21:06,974
Or models afraid
they'll marry only bald men

238
00:21:06,976 --> 00:21:09,545
- if they put one on.
- (Alma chuckles)

239
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:15,619
And where's the dress now?

240
00:21:18,387 --> 00:21:20,853
I have no idea
what happened to it.

241
00:21:20,855 --> 00:21:22,389
No idea.

242
00:21:22,391 --> 00:21:25,360
Oh, most probably turned
to ashes by now,

243
00:21:25,362 --> 00:21:27,331
fallen to pieces.

244
00:21:29,065 --> 00:21:32,600
And your sister?

245
00:21:32,602 --> 00:21:33,838
What?

246
00:21:35,072 --> 00:21:37,639
Did she ever marry?

247
00:21:37,641 --> 00:21:39,807
No.

248
00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:43,078
Come on, boys,
let's have a fire.

249
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,650
(flames crackling)

250
00:21:51,689 --> 00:21:53,825
(sighs)

251
00:22:00,797 --> 00:22:03,699
If you want to have
a staring contest with me,

252
00:22:03,701 --> 00:22:06,605
you will lose.

253
00:22:07,805 --> 00:22:10,575
Hmm.

254
00:22:11,643 --> 00:22:13,746
(chuckles)

255
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,650
(chuckles softly)

256
00:22:23,622 --> 00:22:26,659
You are a very handsome man.

257
00:22:28,961 --> 00:22:32,597
You must be around
many beautiful women.

258
00:22:37,002 --> 00:22:39,339
Yes.

259
00:22:41,941 --> 00:22:44,174
So why are you not married?

260
00:22:44,176 --> 00:22:47,979
I make dresses.

261
00:22:47,981 --> 00:22:50,748
You cannot be married
when you make dresses?

262
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,418
I'm certain
I was never meant to marry.

263
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,789
I'm a confirmed bachelor.

264
00:22:58,124 --> 00:23:00,561
I'm incurable.

265
00:23:01,729 --> 00:23:03,631
Hmm.

266
00:23:04,865 --> 00:23:06,698
Marriage would
make me deceitful,

267
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,371
and I don't ever want that.

268
00:23:12,505 --> 00:23:15,039
You sound so sure
about things.

269
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:16,743
I'm sure about that.

270
00:23:20,815 --> 00:23:25,050
I think you're only
acting strong.

271
00:23:25,052 --> 00:23:27,889
No, I am strong.

272
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:31,958
For who?

273
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,663
Not for me, I hope.

274
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:41,501
I think it's the expectations
and assumptions of others

275
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,672
that cause heartache.

276
00:23:52,648 --> 00:23:54,784
Would you help me
with something?

277
00:23:56,552 --> 00:23:58,955
- Yes.
- Come on.

278
00:24:12,602 --> 00:24:15,739
Good. Just jump up
on the box for me.

279
00:24:46,004 --> 00:24:48,607
(clasps clicking)

280
00:25:14,132 --> 00:25:15,802
Um...

281
00:25:18,737 --> 00:25:21,204
I think we're gonna try and...

282
00:25:21,206 --> 00:25:23,911
pull this back for you.

283
00:25:49,202 --> 00:25:51,103
Pretty good.

284
00:25:51,105 --> 00:25:53,107
One moment.

285
00:25:57,778 --> 00:26:01,048
We'll save that one for...
another time.

286
00:26:07,989 --> 00:26:10,122
Quite nice.

287
00:26:10,124 --> 00:26:11,961
But, um...

288
00:26:14,061 --> 00:26:15,865
Mm.

289
00:26:17,298 --> 00:26:19,635
Bit serious.

290
00:26:35,318 --> 00:26:37,119
This one.

291
00:26:39,021 --> 00:26:41,058
Do you like it?

292
00:26:42,658 --> 00:26:44,962
- Yes.
- It's very good.

293
00:26:50,133 --> 00:26:52,001
(scissors cutting)

294
00:26:54,703 --> 00:26:56,703
That's it.

295
00:26:56,705 --> 00:26:58,072
Let's get that off you,

296
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:00,241
and then I'd like to take
your measurements.

297
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:02,179
Is that all right?

298
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:22,129
Who's this lovely creature
making the house smell so nice?

299
00:27:22,131 --> 00:27:24,434
Hello. I'm Alma.

300
00:27:24,436 --> 00:27:27,005
I'm Cyril.

301
00:27:30,308 --> 00:27:32,911
Sandalwood and rose water.

302
00:27:37,048 --> 00:27:39,147
(sniffs)

303
00:27:39,149 --> 00:27:43,418
Mm, sherry and...

304
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,788
(sniffs)
lemon juice?

305
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:49,225
Mm. Mm-hmm,
we had fish for dinner.

306
00:27:49,227 --> 00:27:53,132
REYNOLDS: My old so-and-so,
would you mind?

307
00:28:19,892 --> 00:28:22,228
(pencil scratching on paper)

308
00:28:33,305 --> 00:28:35,140
Can you step towards me?

309
00:28:35,142 --> 00:28:36,310
Ready?

310
00:28:41,082 --> 00:28:42,217
Thirty-two.

311
00:28:44,518 --> 00:28:47,352
Thirty.

312
00:28:47,354 --> 00:28:49,190
Thirty-one.

313
00:28:54,428 --> 00:28:57,996
35 and a half.

314
00:29:01,536 --> 00:29:03,870
14 and a half.

315
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:06,105
Seventeen.

316
00:29:06,107 --> 00:29:08,374
Twenty.

317
00:29:08,376 --> 00:29:10,409
Just stand normally.

318
00:29:10,411 --> 00:29:12,215
(quietly):
Yes.

319
00:29:13,481 --> 00:29:15,215
I stand normally.

320
00:29:15,217 --> 00:29:16,882
Like before.

321
00:29:16,884 --> 00:29:18,317
What do you mean?

322
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:19,852
- Straight.
- Straight.

323
00:29:19,854 --> 00:29:22,124
- Like that.
- Yeah, you didn't say that.

324
00:29:31,233 --> 00:29:33,133
16 and a half.

325
00:29:33,135 --> 00:29:35,239
(pencil scratching on paper)

326
00:29:36,306 --> 00:29:38,573
Eight and a half.

327
00:29:38,575 --> 00:29:39,940
You have no breasts.

328
00:29:39,942 --> 00:29:42,109
Twenty-two.

329
00:29:42,111 --> 00:29:44,512
- Yes, I know.
- 32 and a half.

330
00:29:44,514 --> 00:29:46,279
You can drop your arm now.

331
00:29:46,281 --> 00:29:47,915
(sighs)
I'm sorry.

332
00:29:47,917 --> 00:29:50,052
No, no, you're perfect.

333
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:52,323
My job to give you some.

334
00:29:54,858 --> 00:29:56,927
If I choose to.

335
00:29:59,195 --> 00:30:00,397
Ten.

336
00:30:01,598 --> 00:30:03,931
Nine.

337
00:30:03,933 --> 00:30:06,136
Six and a half.

338
00:30:07,337 --> 00:30:10,605
Twenty-five...

339
00:30:10,607 --> 00:30:12,508
and... 45.

340
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:15,213
That's it.

341
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:24,086
Would you try something else

01:02:40,237 --> 01:02:42,003
What is this?

830
01:02:42,005 --> 01:02:44,274
I love you, Reynolds.

831
01:02:46,409 --> 01:02:48,980
Yes, but what is this?

832
01:02:50,214 --> 01:02:52,214
It's a surprise.

833
01:02:52,216 --> 01:02:53,581
Are you hungry?

834
01:02:53,583 --> 01:02:56,018
Where is Cyril?

835
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:57,486
(Alma clears throat)

836
01:02:57,488 --> 01:02:59,458
I've sent everyone home.

837
01:03:00,659 --> 01:03:03,128
Where is Cyril?

838
01:03:04,329 --> 01:03:05,662
She's left.

839
01:03:05,664 --> 01:03:08,030
What time did she leave?

840
01:03:08,032 --> 01:03:10,001
This afternoon.

841
01:03:12,436 --> 01:03:14,472
I've made us dinner.

842
01:03:33,292 --> 01:03:36,292
Let me collect myself
for a moment.

843
01:03:36,294 --> 01:03:37,360
(clears throat)

844
01:03:37,362 --> 01:03:40,663
I'll just have a bath,
I think.

845
01:03:40,665 --> 01:03:43,266
This is very kind of you, Alma.

846
01:03:43,268 --> 01:03:45,704
Would you like a champagne
or a martini?

847
01:03:45,706 --> 01:03:48,572
No, thank you.

848
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:50,976
Oh, is that your dress?

849
01:03:50,978 --> 01:03:52,376
It's finished.

850
01:03:52,378 --> 01:03:54,281
Let's have a look at it.

851
01:04:01,588 --> 01:04:04,425
Hmm. It's rather interesting.

852
01:04:05,758 --> 01:04:08,026
Very good work.

853
01:04:08,028 --> 01:04:10,462
I'll just have my bath now.

854
01:04:10,464 --> 01:04:12,565
When will Cyril get back?

855
01:04:12,567 --> 01:04:15,070
Mm, tonight?

856
01:04:21,475 --> 01:04:24,011
(approaching footsteps)

857
01:04:47,635 --> 01:04:49,503
(grunts softly)

858
01:04:49,505 --> 01:04:53,041
How was your appointment
with the princess?

859
01:04:57,180 --> 01:05:01,285
She's very beautiful,
like a sculpture of some kind.

860
01:05:06,656 --> 01:05:08,491
Mm-hmm.

861
01:05:09,758 --> 01:05:15,031
(clears throat) So, will you
make her a wedding gown?

862
01:05:17,667 --> 01:05:20,301
I have made her baptism,

863
01:05:20,303 --> 01:05:24,139
her First Communion
and confirmation dresses.

864
01:05:24,141 --> 01:05:26,809
I made the dress
for her presentation at court,

865
01:05:26,811 --> 01:05:30,746
indeed the entire wardrobe
for her coming out season.

866
01:05:30,748 --> 01:05:33,782
It's only right that I should
make her wedding dress,

867
01:05:33,784 --> 01:05:35,650
wouldn't you think?

868
01:05:35,652 --> 01:05:37,152
(softly):
Oh, Christ.

869
01:05:37,154 --> 01:05:41,222
No, but this is not
what I wanted to say.

870
01:05:41,224 --> 01:05:43,826
I'm-I'm sorry, I don't know
what I said, I...

871
01:05:43,828 --> 01:05:46,432
This is meant to be
nice evening.

872
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:50,102
Let me serve you.

873
01:06:08,754 --> 01:06:11,324
(shaking continues)

874
01:06:26,705 --> 01:06:29,607
Do you like it?

875
01:06:29,609 --> 01:06:31,608
I do.

876
01:06:31,610 --> 01:06:33,912
(continues chewing)

877
01:06:33,914 --> 01:06:36,747
No, you don't.

878
01:06:36,749 --> 01:06:39,483
You don't like it at all.

879
01:06:39,485 --> 01:06:42,620
Usually you always tell me
what you think.

880
01:06:42,622 --> 01:06:44,588
What is this?

881
01:06:44,590 --> 01:06:46,326
You're lying.

882
01:06:51,731 --> 01:06:54,365
As I think you know, Alma,

883
01:06:54,367 --> 01:06:58,140
I prefer my asparagus
with oil and salt.

884
01:06:59,207 --> 01:07:00,705
And knowing this,

885
01:07:00,707 --> 01:07:03,509
you've prepared the asparagus
with butter.

886
01:07:03,511 --> 01:07:06,511
Now, I can imagine
in certain circumstances

887
01:07:06,513 --> 01:07:10,618
being able to pretend
that I like it made this way.

888
01:07:12,386 --> 01:07:15,453
Right now, I'm just admiring
my own gallantry

889
01:07:15,455 --> 01:07:18,359
for eating it the way
you've prepared it.

890
01:07:19,928 --> 01:07:22,465
I don't know
what I'm doing here.

891
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:27,800
I-I don't know
what I'm doing here.

892
01:07:27,802 --> 01:07:33,208
I'm just waiting around
like an idiot for you.

893
01:07:34,543 --> 01:07:37,343
This was an ambush, Alma.
To what purpose?

894
01:07:37,345 --> 01:07:39,646
This is not...

895
01:07:39,648 --> 01:07:41,682
I know it's not going
as I expected.

896
01:07:41,684 --> 01:07:43,717
I-I didn't mean these things
to come out.

897
01:07:43,719 --> 01:07:46,286
I'm sorry,
but it was meant to be nice.

898
01:07:46,288 --> 01:07:47,689
Well, what did you expect?

899
01:07:47,691 --> 01:07:48,890
I wanted time with you.

900
01:07:48,892 --> 01:07:50,757
I wanted to have you
to myself.

901
01:07:50,759 --> 01:07:52,527
You have me all the time.

902
01:07:52,529 --> 01:07:54,295
- No.
- What are you talking about?

903
01:07:54,297 --> 01:07:55,562
I don't.
I... There-there's...

904
01:07:55,564 --> 01:07:57,464
there are always people around.

905
01:07:57,466 --> 01:08:00,234
And if not, then there's
something between us.

906
01:08:00,236 --> 01:08:01,803
- Something between us?
- Yes.

907
01:08:01,805 --> 01:08:03,237
What?

908
01:08:03,239 --> 01:08:05,306
Some...

909
01:08:05,308 --> 01:08:07,678
- What?
- Distance.

910
01:08:08,846 --> 01:08:10,746
When did this happen?

911
01:08:10,748 --> 01:08:13,652
What happened to make you
behave like this?

912
01:08:15,318 --> 01:08:18,522
Is it because you think
I don't need you?

913
01:08:19,991 --> 01:08:22,457
- Yes.
- I don't.

914
01:08:22,459 --> 01:08:24,892
Well, that's very predictable
of you.

915
01:08:24,894 --> 01:08:26,729
Don't act so tough.

916
01:08:26,731 --> 01:08:28,264
I know you are not.

917
01:08:28,266 --> 01:08:29,731
Yeah, that's right.
That's right.

918
01:08:29,733 --> 01:08:30,733
If I don't protect myself,

919
01:08:30,735 --> 01:08:33,003
somebody will come
in the middle of the night

920
01:08:33,005 --> 01:08:34,671
and take over my corner
of the room

921
01:08:34,673 --> 01:08:37,274
and ask me about
their fucking asparagus.

922
01:08:37,276 --> 01:08:38,374
Don't be a bully.
You're being a bully.

923
01:08:38,376 --> 01:08:40,009
There are other things
I'd like to do with my time.

924
01:08:40,011 --> 01:08:41,477
- It's my time. My time!
- I have no idea

925
01:08:41,479 --> 01:08:43,280
what I'm doing here
in your time.

926
01:08:43,282 --> 01:08:44,681
What am I doing here?

927
01:08:44,683 --> 01:08:46,749
I'm standing around like
an idiot waiting for you.

928
01:08:46,751 --> 01:08:48,418
- Waiting for what?
- Waiting for you.

929
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:50,423
Waiting for what?

930
01:08:51,490 --> 01:08:54,457
Waiting for you
to get rid of me.

931
01:08:54,459 --> 01:08:56,693
To tell me to leave.

932
01:08:56,695 --> 01:08:58,629
So tell me.

933
01:08:58,631 --> 01:09:01,766
So I don't stand around
like a fucking fool.

934
01:09:01,768 --> 01:09:03,767
Asparagus, is this all about
your asparagus?

935
01:09:03,769 --> 01:09:05,803
- No, it's not about asparagus.
- Then what...

936
01:09:05,805 --> 01:09:06,937
the hell is it about?

937
01:09:06,939 --> 01:09:08,505
Are you a special agent
sent here

938
01:09:08,507 --> 01:09:10,473
to ruin my evening
and possibly my entire life?

939
01:09:10,475 --> 01:09:11,976
Why are you so rude to me?

940
01:09:11,978 --> 01:09:13,878
- Why are you talking to me like this?
- Is this my house?

941
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:15,745
- This is my house, isn't it?
- Yes, this is your house.

942
01:09:15,747 --> 01:09:18,382
- Is this my house?
- Of course it's your house.

943
01:09:18,384 --> 01:09:19,784
Or did somebody drop me
on foreign soil

944
01:09:19,786 --> 01:09:21,687
- behind enemy lines?
- What a question.

945
01:09:21,689 --> 01:09:23,654
- You brought me here.
- I'm surrounded on all sides.

946
01:09:23,656 --> 01:09:24,923
It's you who brought me here.

947
01:09:24,925 --> 01:09:26,657
When the hell did this happen?
Who are you?

948
01:09:26,659 --> 01:09:28,893
Do you have a gun?
You here to kill me?

949
01:09:28,895 --> 01:09:30,996
- Why are you talking like...?
- Hmm? Do you have a gun?

950
01:09:30,998 --> 01:09:33,665
- Stop it! Stop being a child.
- Where's your gun?

951
01:09:33,667 --> 01:09:35,666
- Where's your gun?
- Stop playing.

952
01:09:35,668 --> 01:09:38,536
- Show me your gun.
- Stop playing this game.

953
01:09:38,538 --> 01:09:39,804
- I'm not playing a game.
- I am not.

954
01:09:39,806 --> 01:09:41,039
Yes, mm-hmm, uh-huh.

955
01:09:41,041 --> 01:09:42,741
What game am I playing?
What game?

956
01:09:42,743 --> 01:09:45,377
What precisely is the nature
of my game?

957
01:09:45,379 --> 01:09:46,778
You tell me.

958
01:09:46,780 --> 01:09:47,882
Oh, this whole...

959
01:09:50,118 --> 01:09:51,516
What?

960
01:09:51,518 --> 01:09:53,086
All your rules and your walls

961
01:09:53,088 --> 01:09:55,421
and your doors and your people

962
01:09:55,423 --> 01:09:59,524
and your money and all this
clothes and everything.

963
01:09:59,526 --> 01:10:01,426
This, this, this game!

964
01:10:01,428 --> 01:10:02,694
Everything here!

965
01:10:02,696 --> 01:10:04,596
- The whole... (sputters)
- (silverware clattering)

966
01:10:04,598 --> 01:10:07,833
Nothing is normal
or natural or...

967
01:10:07,835 --> 01:10:09,472
Everything is a game.

968
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,574
"Yes, mister. No, madam.

969
01:10:13,576 --> 01:10:15,609
Yes, uh..." (mutters)

970
01:10:15,611 --> 01:10:17,977
- Well, if it's my...
- "I don't eat this.

971
01:10:17,979 --> 01:10:20,847
- I don't drink that. I don't do..."
- If-if-if...

972
01:10:20,849 --> 01:10:22,483
If it's my life
that you're describing,

973
01:10:22,485 --> 01:10:23,816
it's entirely up to you

974
01:10:23,818 --> 01:10:25,651
whether you choose
to share it or not.

975
01:10:25,653 --> 01:10:27,788
If you don't wish to share
that life, as apparently

976
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:29,757
it's so disagreeable to you
in every respect,

977
01:10:29,759 --> 01:10:32,794
why don't you just fuck off
to back where you came from?

978
01:10:32,796 --> 01:10:34,799
F... Yeah, mm-hmm.

979
01:10:36,166 --> 01:10:38,736
(departing footsteps)

980
01:10:41,404 --> 01:10:43,607
(door slams shut)

981
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:56,116
Sometimes, it's good for him

982
01:10:56,118 --> 01:10:59,490
to slow down his steps
a little.

983
01:11:00,992 --> 01:11:03,561
(flames crackling)

984
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:23,983
(birds chirping)

985
01:11:50,242 --> 01:11:52,812
♪ ♪

986
01:12:23,611 --> 01:12:25,979
(talking quietly)

987
01:12:35,055 --> 01:12:38,593
Would you like me to ask Alma
to leave?

988
01:12:41,896 --> 01:12:44,833

- Fuck off.

CYRIL: Reynolds, please,
just let him examine you.

1152
01:24:36,307 --> 01:24:39,408
Mm-hmm, yes.
Yes, fuck off.

1153
01:24:39,410 --> 01:24:42,343
I think this is clear. Hmm?

1154

Not to worry.

1159
01:25:05,903 --> 01:25:08,437
I'll drop by tomorrow morning
to see how he's coming along.

1160
01:25:08,439 --> 01:25:10,040

- Yes. - Yes.

1161
01:25:10,042 --> 01:25:12,776
If his fever increases during
the night, you'll telephone me?

1162
01:25:12,778 --> 01:25:14,511

- Of course, Doctor.

1163
01:25:14,513 --> 01:25:15,911
Good night, Mrs. Woodcock.

1170
01:26:12,573 --> 01:26:14,740
This dress will be ready
by 9:00 a.m.,

1171
01:26:14,742 --> 01:26:17,579
because that's when
it leaves for Belgium.

1172
01:26:24,518 --> 01:26:26,084
CYRIL:
Ladies, I'm very sorry,

1173
01:26:26,086 --> 01:26:28,754
but I'm afraid you'll have
to work late this evening.

1174
01:26:28,756 --> 01:26:32,058
The dress needs to be ready

1175
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:34,660
to make its journey to Belgium.

1176
01:26:34,662 --> 01:26:38,464
Do expect to be here
for quite some time.

1177

If you need to use
the telephone,

1178
01:26:40,469 --> 01:26:42,136
please use the one in my office

1179
01:26:42,138 --> 01:26:43,736
- to alert your families.
- Nana and Biddy,

1180
01:26:43,738 --> 01:26:46,472

- NANA: Could you pin the ribbon

1181
01:26:46,474 --> 01:26:47,807

Thank you.

1182
01:26:47,809 --> 01:26:49,743
CYRIL:
Ladies, I'm very sorry,

1183

but I'm afraid you'll have

So please do expect to be here
possibly for most of the night.

1187
01:27:00,623 --> 01:27:02,624
If you need to make
telephone calls,

1188
01:27:02,626 --> 01:27:05,093
do so from my office.
Thank you.

1307
01:38:41,253 --> 01:38:44,090
LADY BALTIMORE:
Dinner is served, everybody.

1308
01:38:44,889 --> 01:38:46,491
Come along with me.

1309
01:38:48,459 --> 01:38:51,627
So, that's your
shifty-eyed godson?

1310
01:38:51,629 --> 01:38:53,663
Shifty-eyed?

1311
01:38:53,665 --> 01:38:56,667
He's got perfectly normal eyes.

1312
01:38:56,669 --> 01:38:59,503
I'm rather less fat, I think,
than when you last saw me.

1313
01:38:59,505 --> 01:39:00,471
Really?

1314
01:39:00,473 --> 01:39:02,205
- Yes.
- Thank you very much.

1315
01:39:02,207 --> 01:39:03,841
It's fallen off me.

1316
01:39:03,843 --> 01:39:05,642
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1317
01:39:05,644 --> 01:39:07,444
REYNOLDS:
Very hard to tell sometimes.

1318
01:39:07,446 --> 01:39:10,847
I suppose that, um, there
are secrets nobody tells.

1319
01:39:10,849 --> 01:39:12,316
(Alma laughing)

1320
01:39:12,318 --> 01:39:15,285
Your wife has got
that gorgeous glow

1321
01:39:15,287 --> 01:39:17,288
you get with a first marriage.

1322
01:39:17,290 --> 01:39:19,657
HARDY:
How long will you be here for?

1323
01:39:19,659 --> 01:39:23,530
Seems my godson's rather
enjoying that glow as well.

1324
01:39:25,799 --> 01:39:29,267
So, what are your plans
for New Year's Eve?

1325
01:39:29,269 --> 01:39:33,141
Oh, um... we don't have any.

1326
01:39:34,640 --> 01:39:37,545
Then you should come out
for the Chelsea Arts Club Ball.

1327
01:39:38,644 --> 01:39:39,611
(chuckles)

1328
01:39:39,613 --> 01:39:41,545
- I don't know what that is.
- Well, it's not

1329
01:39:41,547 --> 01:39:42,982
something I'd suggest
if I didn't think

1330
01:39:42,984 --> 01:39:44,416
you'd have a wonderful time.

1331
01:39:44,418 --> 01:39:46,421
It's really something
to be seen.

1332
01:39:47,821 --> 01:39:50,923
(clears throat)
I'll pass it on to my husband,

1333
01:39:50,925 --> 01:39:53,462
but I think we'll stay in.

1334
01:39:56,830 --> 01:39:58,663
Change your mind.

1335
01:39:58,665 --> 01:40:01,334
- Or get him to change his mind.
- (chuckles)

1336
01:40:01,336 --> 01:40:03,236
Or whatever it takes.
Now, please come.

1337
01:40:03,238 --> 01:40:05,774
I promise you
the time of your life.

1338
01:40:08,744 --> 01:40:11,781
How do you know
how my life has been?

1339
01:40:13,514 --> 01:40:15,418
I don't.

1340
01:40:16,986 --> 01:40:18,484
You're right.

1341
01:40:18,486 --> 01:40:20,720
I think this would be
quite a fine time,

1342
01:40:20,722 --> 01:40:23,590
if you'd like to come.

1343
01:40:23,592 --> 01:40:26,462
She's barely looked at you
this evening, has she?

1344
01:40:29,865 --> 01:40:32,203
(loud rattling)

1345
01:40:35,639 --> 01:40:38,605
I think they're well
and truly shaken now.

1346
01:40:38,607 --> 01:40:41,411
(rattling stops;
dice drop on board)

1347
01:40:45,014 --> 01:40:47,350
(muttering quietly)

1348
01:40:48,285 --> 01:40:49,950
What on earth are you doing?

1349
01:40:49,952 --> 01:40:51,386
I rolled a three.

1350
01:40:51,388 --> 01:40:53,387
Yes, but that's the four pip.

1351
01:40:53,389 --> 01:40:55,557
- Get back to the bar where you belong.
- Oh.

1352
01:40:55,559 --> 01:40:57,392
Sorry.

1353
01:40:57,394 --> 01:40:58,826
Let's not start cheating
at this stage, Alma.

1354
01:40:58,828 --> 01:41:00,495
- I'm not cheating.
- (dice rattle on board)

1355
01:41:00,497 --> 01:41:02,030
- I don't need to cheat.
- Oh, good.

1356
01:41:02,032 --> 01:41:04,799
You do need to be able
to count, on the other hand.

1357
01:41:04,801 --> 01:41:07,535
Backgammon, by the way,
I get treble the score

1358
01:41:07,537 --> 01:41:10,606
because you haven't got
any checkers off the board.

1359
01:41:10,608 --> 01:41:11,940
Oh.

1360
01:41:11,942 --> 01:41:13,075
(sputters)

1361
01:41:13,077 --> 01:41:14,543
Stupid game anyway.

1362
01:41:14,545 --> 01:41:15,910
Well, maybe it seems stupid

1363
01:41:15,912 --> 01:41:18,047
to you now,
as you're currently losing,

1364
01:41:18,049 --> 01:41:19,915
but I dare say,
if you were victorious,

1365
01:41:19,917 --> 01:41:22,518
I'm confident you'd see it
in a different light.

1366
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:24,920
Now, they need your chair
for my next opponent.

1367
01:41:24,922 --> 01:41:26,391
Next.

1368
01:41:27,658 --> 01:41:29,526
- (Reynolds chuckles)
- LADY BALTIMORE: Me, please.

1369
01:41:29,528 --> 01:41:30,859
What?

1370
01:41:30,861 --> 01:41:33,028
What are you so cranky about?

1371
01:41:33,030 --> 01:41:34,664
Have fun with
your next opponent.

1372
01:41:34,666 --> 01:41:37,800
Why, I think I will...
a lot more than I did with you.

1373
01:41:37,802 --> 01:41:39,402
LADY BALTIMORE:
Gosh.

1374
01:41:39,404 --> 01:41:42,374
She's really very rude,
isn't she?

1375
01:41:43,409 --> 01:41:45,443
My heart breaks for you.

1376
01:41:45,445 --> 01:41:47,411
Oh, really?

1377
01:41:47,413 --> 01:41:49,683
Like being married
to a toddler.

1378
01:41:50,917 --> 01:41:53,650
I don't want to be racist,
but, I mean...

1379
01:41:53,652 --> 01:41:56,120
is there some sort of custom
at this time of the night

1380
01:41:56,122 --> 01:41:57,654
in her country where...

1381
01:41:57,656 --> 01:41:59,724
- I mean, what is she doing?
- Where what?

1382
01:41:59,726 --> 01:42:02,559
I don't know. I don't know
if she's up stealing things

1383
01:42:02,561 --> 01:42:04,694
or attacking people. I mean...

across it, every time...

1386
01:42:09,068 --> 01:42:10,935
I want to go dancing.

1388

When?

1389
01:42:16,643 --> 01:42:18,446
Right now.

1390
01:42:21,382 --> 01:42:23,148
You're joking.

1391
01:42:23,150 --> 01:42:25,353
No, I'm not.

1392
01:42:26,085 --> 01:42:27,921
It's New Year's Eve.

1393

(pen scratching on paper)

1395
01:42:38,867 --> 01:42:41,467
There's a party
at the Devonshire Hall

1396
01:42:41,469 --> 01:42:43,802
to celebrate the New Year,

1397

to do about it?

it feels a little big.

take it in at the waist?

- Yes.

Yes, okay, just take it out.

Mm-hmm.

a quarter of an inch

Yes.

She's been to another house.

Which one?

Why didn't you tell me?

Because I didn't want to.

Is there something
I'm unaware of?

Because,
as far as I can remember,

1459

all I have done
is to dress her beautifully.

I don't think that matters
to some people.

I think they want
what is fashionable and chic.

Chic?

1463

Fucking chic?

Fucking chic.

- It shouldn't concern you.
- It does concern me.

1471
01:49:32,830 --> 01:49:34,029
It concerns me
very much, Cyril,

1472
01:49:34,031 --> 01:49:35,597
because it's hurt my feelings.

1473
01:49:35,599 --> 01:49:38,803

We built this house,
the two of us.

Now she's turning the whole

She's turning me inside out.

She's turning you and me

Her arrival has cast
a very long shadow, Cyril.
