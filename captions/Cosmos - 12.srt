00:00:46,477 --> 00:00:48,911
SAGAN:
In the vastness of the cosmos...

2
00:00:49,113 --> 00:00:52,139
...there must be other civilizations
far older...

3
00:00:52,349 --> 00:00:54,214
...and more advanced than ours.

4
00:00:54,418 --> 00:00:58,286
So shouldn't we have been visited?
Shouldn't there be...

5
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:02,289
...alien ships in the skies of Earth?

6
00:01:03,627 --> 00:01:05,754
There's nothing impossible
in this idea.

7
00:01:05,963 --> 00:01:08,864
And no one would be happier than me
if we were visited.

8
00:01:09,066 --> 00:01:12,092
But has it happened in fact?

9
00:01:12,303 --> 00:01:16,865
What counts is not what's plausible,
not what we'd like to believe...

10
00:01:17,074 --> 00:01:19,440
...not what one or two witnesses
claim.

11
00:01:19,643 --> 00:01:22,510
But only what is supported
by hard evidence...

12
00:01:22,713 --> 00:01:25,443
...rigorously and skeptically
examined.

13
00:01:25,649 --> 00:01:30,586
Extraordinary claims
require extraordinary evidence.

14
00:01:34,558 --> 00:01:39,495
Since 1947, there have been hundreds
of thousands of reports of UFOs:

15
00:01:39,864 --> 00:01:42,731
Unidentified flying objects.

16
00:01:42,933 --> 00:01:44,332
This subject has...

17
00:01:44,535 --> 00:01:48,528
...more to do with religion and
superstition than with science.

18
00:01:48,739 --> 00:01:52,641
Let's consider one of the most famous
accounts of a supposed encounter...

19
00:01:52,843 --> 00:01:54,811
...with alien beings.

20
00:01:55,179 --> 00:01:57,477
On September 19, 1961...

21
00:01:57,681 --> 00:02:01,344
...an American couple was driving home
through New Hampshire.

22
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:03,186
What's the matter, Delsey?

23
00:02:05,022 --> 00:02:07,820
SAGAN: They were returning along
a lonely road, late at night...

24
00:02:08,025 --> 00:02:10,323
...from a vacation in Canada.

25
00:02:11,996 --> 00:02:15,591
Remember, we have only their word
for what happened next.

(STATIC FROM RADIO)

28
00:02:22,973 --> 00:02:24,873
I'm only getting static.

29
00:02:27,111 --> 00:02:29,375
You still don't believe it, do you?

30
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,211
No, I don't. There must be
a reasonable explanation.

31
00:02:33,417 --> 00:02:34,475
Oh!

32
00:02:34,685 --> 00:02:37,176
SAGAN:
They had observed, so they said...

33
00:02:37,388 --> 00:02:39,913
...a strange moving light in the sky.

34
00:02:40,124 --> 00:02:43,423
By definition,
an unidentified flying object.

35
00:02:43,794 --> 00:02:46,058
It seemed to follow them for miles.

36
00:02:47,231 --> 00:02:48,198
Easy there.

37
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:50,333
What's the matter with that dog?

(HUMMING NOISE)

39
00:02:53,571 --> 00:02:55,129
What's that sound?

40
00:02:59,043 --> 00:03:00,203
I don't know.

41
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:04,809
After a time, the lighting patterns
on the UFO changed.

42
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:09,711
It appeared to land.

43
00:03:13,324 --> 00:03:14,291
What the...

44
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,125
It blocked the road,
preventing them from driving on.

45
00:03:25,436 --> 00:03:29,566
They said they saw
mouthless creatures approaching...

46
00:03:29,773 --> 00:03:32,674
...who were not exactly human.

47
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,443
Barney!

48
00:03:34,645 --> 00:03:36,237
Barney, what is that?

49
00:03:38,616 --> 00:03:42,211
At this point, the story
becomes still stranger.

50
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:46,617
They lost all recollection of what
happened in the next few hours.

51
00:03:50,127 --> 00:03:52,061
But weeks later, they said...

52
00:03:52,263 --> 00:03:56,597
...they recalled some details and
discussed the experience with others.

53
00:04:00,904 --> 00:04:04,203
26 months later, under hypnosis...

54
00:04:04,475 --> 00:04:06,943
...they reported that
a UFO had landed...

55
00:04:07,144 --> 00:04:09,612
...and that the crew had emerged.

56
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:24,827
They were captured, they said,
and taken aboard the craft.

57
00:04:34,204 --> 00:04:35,364
(WHINES)

58
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:45,747
That was the story told by
Betty and Barney Hill.

59
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:49,646
Virtually all scientists
who've studied it are skeptical.

60
00:04:49,853 --> 00:04:54,381
But UFO enthusiasts think
the Hill case is a classic example...

61
00:04:54,591 --> 00:04:57,924
...of a "close encounter
of the third kind."

62
00:04:58,128 --> 00:05:01,359
Why? What makes it so special?

63
00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:05,194
While on board, Betty had noticed...

64
00:05:05,402 --> 00:05:08,667
...a book written in an unknown
hieroglyphic writing.

65
00:05:08,872 --> 00:05:12,330
She was also shown a strange window
through which she could see...

66
00:05:12,543 --> 00:05:15,740
...a glowing pattern of dots
connected with lines.

67
00:05:15,946 --> 00:05:18,437
It was, they told her, a star map...

68
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:21,914
...displaying the routes
of interstellar commerce.

69
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:25,418
Afterwards, they were released
and permitted to return home.

70
00:05:25,622 --> 00:05:27,715
Or at least, this is their story.

71
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:31,624
Believers find this compelling,
or at least plausible...

72
00:05:31,829 --> 00:05:34,423
...chiefly because of
the alleged star map.

73
00:05:34,998 --> 00:05:37,967
Here's how Betty said it looked.

74
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:40,796
Why would we take this seriously?

75
00:05:41,004 --> 00:05:45,805
Because here is a real map widely
publicized by UFO enthusiasts...

76
00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:50,275
...of 15 selected nearby stars,
including the sun...

77
00:05:50,547 --> 00:05:54,142
...as seen from one particular
vantage point in space.

78
00:05:54,351 --> 00:05:55,978
This map includes stars...

79
00:05:56,653 --> 00:05:59,383
...that were first cataloged
several years after...

80
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,219
...Betty Hill recalled what she says
she saw in the alien ship.

81
00:06:03,427 --> 00:06:05,622
Her map required, we are told...

82
00:06:05,829 --> 00:06:08,263
...information that wasn't
available on Earth.

83
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:12,669
There is a resemblance between
the two maps, but that's because...

84
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,634
...the lines corresponding
to navigation routes...

85
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:19,935
...have been copied from the Hill map
onto the real star map.

86
00:06:20,277 --> 00:06:24,577
If we were to substitute
some other set of lines...

87
00:06:24,782 --> 00:06:28,445
...for the Hill lines, we find that
the eye suddenly is biased...

88
00:06:28,652 --> 00:06:32,144
...against seeing any agreement
between the two maps at all.

89
00:06:33,323 --> 00:06:38,192
To make an objective test, however,
let's remove the lines altogether.

90
00:06:40,564 --> 00:06:43,533
And then there's very little
resemblance left.

91
00:06:43,734 --> 00:06:45,361
But these particular stars...

92
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:48,868
...are selected from a large catalog
of star positions.

93
00:06:49,072 --> 00:06:52,041
Our vantage point is also
selected to make the best...

94
00:06:52,242 --> 00:06:54,710
...possible fit with the Hill map.

95
00:06:54,912 --> 00:06:58,507
If you can pick and choose
from a large number of stars...

96
00:06:58,715 --> 00:07:01,013
...viewed from any vantage point
in space...

97
00:07:01,218 --> 00:07:05,279
...you can always find a resemblance
to the pattern you're looking for.

98
00:07:05,489 --> 00:07:07,582
I'm surprised that nobody found...

99
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:10,817
...a better fit to the Hill map.

100
00:07:12,296 --> 00:07:17,063
The Hills' own psychiatrist described
their story as a kind of dream.

101
00:07:17,267 --> 00:07:21,328
There's no corroborating evidence.
The star map argument is worthless.

102
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:24,507
And yet this is one of
the best attested cases...

103
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:27,040
...of UFO close encounters.

104
00:07:27,244 --> 00:07:29,041
For all I know, we're visited...

105
00:07:29,246 --> 00:07:33,182
...by a different extraterrestrial
civilization every second Tuesday.

106
00:07:33,383 --> 00:07:36,614
But there's no support
for this appealing idea.

107
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:41,052
The extraordinary claims are not
supported by extraordinary evidence.

108
00:07:42,593 --> 00:07:45,926
There are curious daylight photos
of UFOs.

109
00:07:48,499 --> 00:07:50,490
Some look suspiciously like...

110
00:07:50,701 --> 00:07:53,829
...hats or hubcaps thrown
into the air.

111
00:07:54,037 --> 00:07:56,164
Photos can be faked.

112
00:08:01,211 --> 00:08:04,009
More common are unidentified
lights at night.

113
00:08:04,214 --> 00:08:05,374
They're often aircraft.

114
00:08:05,582 --> 00:08:09,245
But if we can't identify a light,
that doesn't make it a spaceship.

115
00:08:14,525 --> 00:08:17,085
Here's a movie of what
you might think is a UFO.

116
00:08:17,294 --> 00:08:20,229
Actually it's a piece
of an asteroid burning up...

117
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,762
...as it enters the Earth's
atmosphere.

118
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:33,773
Most reports of UFOs turn out
to be something else, like...

119
00:08:33,977 --> 00:08:38,710
...the refracted image of a planet or
re-entry of an artificial satellite.

120
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:42,545
Some are psychological aberrations.
Some are hoaxes.

121
00:08:42,786 --> 00:08:46,620
Never is there any compelling
physical evidence...

122
00:08:46,823 --> 00:08:50,190
...a detailed close-up photograph
of a strange spacecraft...

123
00:08:50,394 --> 00:08:53,557
...or a small device of
extraterrestrial manufacture...

124
00:08:53,764 --> 00:08:56,699
...or a book written in
alien hieroglyphics.

125
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,958
Never.

126
00:08:58,168 --> 00:09:02,764
There are reports of such things,
but never the things themselves.

127
00:09:05,342 --> 00:09:09,972
The search for alien civilizations
retains its importance despite...

128
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:13,206
...the striking failure
of the UFO evidence.

129
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:16,409
Most astronomers consider
extraterrestrial life...

130
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,681
...a subject worthy of vigorous,
if cautious, pursuit.

131
00:09:20,891 --> 00:09:25,021
For myself, I find something
irresistible in the idea of...

132
00:09:25,228 --> 00:09:28,595
...discovering a token,
maybe a simple inscription...

133
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:33,736
...which would provide the key to
understanding an alien civilization.

134
00:09:34,104 --> 00:09:37,972
This is an appeal we humans
have felt before.

135
00:09:54,324 --> 00:09:55,552
In 1801...

136
00:09:55,759 --> 00:10:00,696
...a famous physicist was governor
of the French province of Is?re.

137
00:10:02,866 --> 00:10:05,596
His name was Joseph Fourier.

138
00:10:07,004 --> 00:10:09,632
On an inspection of the schools
in his province...

139
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,775
...Fourier discovered an exceptional
1 1-year-old boy:

140
00:10:12,976 --> 00:10:15,035
Jean Francois Champollion.

141
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:23,781
The boy's precocious intellect and
remarkable flair for languages...

142
00:10:23,987 --> 00:10:27,047
...had earned him the admiration
of local scholars.

143
00:10:27,257 --> 00:10:29,919
Fourier too was impressed.

144
00:10:34,631 --> 00:10:37,794
What Champollion first saw
in Fourier's house...

145
00:10:38,001 --> 00:10:39,901
...determined the course
of his life...

146
00:10:40,103 --> 00:10:43,800
...and unlocked the secrets
of an alien civilization.

147
00:10:46,243 --> 00:10:49,906
Fourier had recently participated,
as one of many scientists...

148
00:10:50,113 --> 00:10:52,775
...in Napoleon's expedition
to the Middle East.

149
00:10:52,983 --> 00:10:57,682
He had been in charge of cataloging
the astronomical monuments of Egypt.

150
00:10:59,823 --> 00:11:02,917
The boy was entranced by
Fourier's collection...

151
00:11:03,126 --> 00:11:05,390
...of ancient Egyptian artifacts:

152
00:11:05,595 --> 00:11:08,530
The mysterious fragments
of a lost world.

153
00:11:17,307 --> 00:11:20,333
France at this time was flooded
with such artifacts...

154
00:11:20,544 --> 00:11:22,273
...plundered by Napoleon...

155
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:27,075
...and now arousing intense interest
among scholars and the general public.

156
00:11:38,829 --> 00:11:40,421
His attention was caught...

157
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:44,066
...by a specimen of
Egyptian hieroglyphics.

158
00:11:56,413 --> 00:11:58,472
"What do they mean? " he asked.

159
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:01,777
"Nobody knows," was Fourier's reply.

160
00:12:02,853 --> 00:12:05,253
Then and there,
Champollion resolved...

161
00:12:05,455 --> 00:12:08,583
...he would understand this language
no one could read...

162
00:12:08,792 --> 00:12:12,728
...he would decode the messages
from another world and another time.

163
00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:17,798
He became a superb linguist and
immersed himself in the hieroglyphics.

164
00:12:23,907 --> 00:12:28,469
Fourier edited the illustrated
description of Napoleon's expedition.

165
00:12:28,678 --> 00:12:31,977
The young Champollion
studied it hungrily.

166
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,915
To the people of Europe...

167
00:12:35,118 --> 00:12:40,055
...these exotic images revealed
an utterly alien civilization...

168
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:45,327
...a world of towering monuments
and magical names.

169
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,356
Dendera.

170
00:12:47,564 --> 00:12:49,122
Karnak.

171
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:50,966
Luxor.

172
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:58,607
Every illustration was a riddle
posed by the past to the present.

173
00:13:04,581 --> 00:13:09,018
And among them were pictures of
something called the Rosetta Stone...

174
00:13:11,488 --> 00:13:16,391
...and portraits of the people who
lived among the ruins of the pharaohs.

175
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:23,522
Egypt became the land of
Champollion's dreams.

176
00:13:25,535 --> 00:13:27,594
But it was not until 1828...

177
00:13:27,804 --> 00:13:31,069
...27 years after his fateful
visit with Fourier...

178
00:13:31,274 --> 00:13:34,710
...that Champollion
first set foot in Egypt.

179
00:13:40,717 --> 00:13:45,450
With his companions, Champollion
chartered boats in Cairo...

180
00:13:45,655 --> 00:13:48,590
...and sailed slowly upstream...

181
00:13:48,792 --> 00:13:52,250
...following the course of the Nile.

182
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,866
It was a journey of many weeks...

183
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:12,071
...which Champollion recorded
in extraordinary detail.

184
00:14:22,325 --> 00:14:25,317
This was an expedition through time...

185
00:14:25,528 --> 00:14:28,088
...a voyage across the centuries...

186
00:14:28,298 --> 00:14:29,890
...to another world.

187
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,941
Champollion, as an adult...

188
00:14:40,143 --> 00:14:44,011
...had worked out a brilliant
decipherment of the hieroglyphics.

189
00:14:44,214 --> 00:14:48,150
A word, incidentally,
that means "sacred carvings."

190
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:53,054
Now Champollion was making
a pilgrimage...

191
00:14:53,256 --> 00:14:58,023
...to the scene of ancient mysteries
he had been the first to understand.

192
00:15:26,656 --> 00:15:28,146
Champollion wrote:

193
00:15:28,358 --> 00:15:33,193
"The evening of the 16th,
we finally arrived at Dendera.

194
00:15:40,103 --> 00:15:43,436
We were only an hour away
from the temples.

195
00:15:46,609 --> 00:15:48,873
Could we resist the temptation?

196
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:52,412
I ask the coldest of you mortals!

197
00:15:55,986 --> 00:15:59,820
To dine and leave immediately
were the orders of the moment.

198
00:16:06,563 --> 00:16:11,159
Alone and without guides,
we crossed the fields.

199
00:16:14,771 --> 00:16:18,468
Presuming that the temples were
in a straight line from our boat...

200
00:16:18,675 --> 00:16:22,441
...we walked thus for an hour and
a half without finding anything.

201
00:16:22,645 --> 00:16:25,671
We discovered a man who put us
on the correct route...

202
00:16:25,882 --> 00:16:29,215
...and ended up walking with us
with good graces.

203
00:16:35,692 --> 00:16:39,287
The temple appeared to us at last.

204
00:16:49,773 --> 00:16:53,470
I shall not try to describe
the impression which the porches...

205
00:16:53,676 --> 00:16:56,509
...and above all,
the portico made on us.

206
00:16:59,082 --> 00:17:01,642
We stayed there two hours
in ecstasy...

207
00:17:01,851 --> 00:17:05,014
...running through the huge rooms
and trying to read...

208
00:17:05,221 --> 00:17:08,281
...the exterior inscriptions
in the moonlight."

209
00:17:14,898 --> 00:17:17,662
It was with no small rapture
that Champollion...

210
00:17:17,867 --> 00:17:22,361
...entered the secret places of
the temple and scanned the words...

211
00:17:22,572 --> 00:17:25,871
...that had waited patiently
through half a million nights...

212
00:17:26,076 --> 00:17:27,600
...for a reader.

213
00:17:31,081 --> 00:17:33,879
To his brother, Champollion
wrote of his joy...

214
00:17:34,084 --> 00:17:38,077
...in confirming that he could
understand the writing on these walls.

215
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:41,654
"I am now proud," he said...

216
00:17:41,858 --> 00:17:45,123
"...that having followed
the course of the Nile...

217
00:17:45,328 --> 00:17:49,662
...I have the right to announce there
is nothing to modify in our letter...

218
00:17:49,866 --> 00:17:52,232
...on the alphabet of hieroglyphics.

219
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,741
Our alphabet is good.

220
00:18:02,946 --> 00:18:06,347
It is applicable with the same
success, first of all...

221
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:08,881
...in Egyptian monuments of
the Roman epoch...

222
00:18:09,085 --> 00:18:10,985
...and, which is more interesting...

223
00:18:11,187 --> 00:18:15,214
...to the inscriptions on all
temples, palaces and tombs...

224
00:18:15,425 --> 00:18:17,620
...of the Pharaonic epoch."

225
00:18:22,832 --> 00:18:27,769
Champollion was overwhelmed by
the grandeur which surrounded him.

226
00:18:28,571 --> 00:18:30,129
"It is the union," he said...

227
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:34,606
"...of grace and majesty
in the highest degree.

228
00:18:34,811 --> 00:18:36,904
We in Europe are only dwafts.

229
00:18:37,113 --> 00:18:41,140
No nation, ancient or modern, has
conceived the art of architecture...

230
00:18:41,351 --> 00:18:45,185
...on such a sublime, great
and imposing style...

231
00:18:45,388 --> 00:18:47,083
...as the ancient Egyptians.

232
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:51,920
They ordered everything to be done
for people who are 100 feet high."

233
00:18:59,235 --> 00:19:03,103
This is the great temple of Karnak...

234
00:19:03,306 --> 00:19:04,705
...in upper Egypt...

235
00:19:04,908 --> 00:19:09,470
...continuously constructed over
a period of more than 2,000 years...

236
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,806
...until the time of Ptolemy.

237
00:19:12,015 --> 00:19:14,483
It was here Champollion wrote:

238
00:19:14,684 --> 00:19:19,587
"That all the Pharaonic magnificence
appeared to me."

239
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:21,950
What he had seen elsewhere, he said...

240
00:19:22,158 --> 00:19:23,955
..."Seemed to me, miserable...

241
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,563
...compared with the colossal
conceptions around me."

242
00:19:51,554 --> 00:19:54,421
On these walls and columns
at Karnak...

243
00:19:54,624 --> 00:19:56,922
...at Dendera and everywhere else
in Egypt...

244
00:19:57,126 --> 00:20:00,493
...Champollion found that
he could read inscriptions...

245
00:20:00,697 --> 00:20:04,224
...that his decipherment of a few
years earlier had been correct.

246
00:20:04,434 --> 00:20:06,766
But how had he figured it out?

247
00:20:09,772 --> 00:20:13,606
Many had tried and failed
to read the hieroglyphics.

248
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:18,645
A group of scholars thought they were
a picture code full of metaphors...

249
00:20:18,848 --> 00:20:23,649
...mostly about eyeballs,
wavy lines and animals.

250
00:20:23,853 --> 00:20:28,654
Birds, especially birds,
lots of birds.

251
00:20:31,494 --> 00:20:36,431
Some deduced that the Egyptians
had been colonists from China.

252
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,893
There were those who deduced it
the other way around.

253
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,802
There's one who, from one look at the
Rosetta Stone, deduced its meaning.

254
00:20:49,012 --> 00:20:51,674
He said that the quickness
of his decipherment...

255
00:20:51,881 --> 00:20:55,373
...enabled him "to avoid
the systematic errors...

256
00:20:55,585 --> 00:20:59,248
...which invariably arise
from prolonged reflection."

257
00:20:59,455 --> 00:21:03,551
You get better results, he's saying,
if you don't think about it too much.

258
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,958
As in the search for
extraterrestrial intelligence today...

259
00:21:08,164 --> 00:21:11,292
...the unbridled speculation
by amateurs...

260
00:21:11,501 --> 00:21:15,028
...served to frighten many
professionals right out of the field.

261
00:21:25,615 --> 00:21:27,412
Champollion was not frightened.

262
00:21:27,617 --> 00:21:30,245
He was also not distracted
by the idea...

263
00:21:30,453 --> 00:21:33,183
...of hieroglyphs as
pictorial metaphors.

264
00:21:33,389 --> 00:21:34,947
Instead...

265
00:21:35,158 --> 00:21:39,822
...using the insights of a brilliant
English physicist, Thomas Young...

266
00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:42,122
...he proceeded something like this:

267
00:21:42,732 --> 00:21:47,066
This is an exact replica
of the Rosetta Stone.

268
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:50,205
The original had been found
in the year 1 799...

269
00:21:50,406 --> 00:21:53,170
...by a French soldier working
on the fortifications...

270
00:21:53,376 --> 00:21:56,311
...of the Nile delta town of Rashid...

271
00:21:56,512 --> 00:22:00,676
...which the Europeans, in their
persistence not to learn Arabic...

272
00:22:00,883 --> 00:22:02,316
...called "Rosetta."

273
00:22:02,518 --> 00:22:07,285
It had been part of an ancient temple
which had been torn down.

274
00:22:07,557 --> 00:22:10,720
If we look at it,
we see that it clearly...

275
00:22:10,927 --> 00:22:14,727
...represents the same text
in three different languages.

276
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:18,267
Up at the top,
ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics.

277
00:22:18,468 --> 00:22:21,028
In the middle, a kind of cursive...

278
00:22:21,237 --> 00:22:23,728
...and later hieroglyphic
called "Demotic."

279
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:28,104
And down at the bottom,
the key to the enterprise: Greek.

280
00:22:28,478 --> 00:22:32,414
Champollion could read ancient Greek,
he was a superb linguist...

281
00:22:32,615 --> 00:22:36,642
...and discovered that this stone
had been inscribed...

282
00:22:36,853 --> 00:22:38,684
...to commemorate the coronation...

283
00:22:38,888 --> 00:22:42,085
...of King Ptolemy V
Epiphanes...

284
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:46,785
...in the spring of the year 196 B.C.

285
00:22:47,263 --> 00:22:52,166
As expected, the Greek text includes
many references to King Ptolemy.

286
00:22:52,368 --> 00:22:53,926
Here you can see it.

287
00:22:54,137 --> 00:22:58,471
"Ptolemaeus."

288
00:22:59,675 --> 00:23:03,668
In roughly the same positions
but in the hieroglyphic text...

289
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:09,116
...are these ovals or "cartouches"
as they are called.

290
00:23:09,318 --> 00:23:12,845
And if this cartouche really
means "Ptolemy"...

291
00:23:13,055 --> 00:23:17,992
...the individual hieroglyphs are not
likely to be pictograms or metaphors.

292
00:23:18,194 --> 00:23:22,153
Much more likely, they're letters
or at least syllables.

293
00:23:22,365 --> 00:23:24,799
Champollion had the presence
of mind...

294
00:23:25,001 --> 00:23:28,232
...to count up the number
of Greek words...

295
00:23:28,438 --> 00:23:31,601
...and the number of
individual hieroglyphics...

296
00:23:31,808 --> 00:23:34,072
...in what are presumably
equivalent texts.

297
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:38,543
He found that the number of
individual hieroglyphs...

298
00:23:38,748 --> 00:23:41,945
...is much larger than the number
of Greek words...

299
00:23:42,151 --> 00:23:46,087
...again implying that the hieroglyphs
are mainly letters and syllables.

300
00:23:46,289 --> 00:23:50,919
But which hieroglyphs correspond
to which letters?

301
00:23:51,127 --> 00:23:55,359
Fortunately, Champollion had available
a kind of second Rosetta Stone...

302
00:23:55,565 --> 00:23:59,524
...an obelisk which had been excavated
at the temple of Philae...

303
00:23:59,735 --> 00:24:03,364
...and which had inscribed upon it...

304
00:24:03,573 --> 00:24:07,942
...cartouches representing
the hieroglyphic equivalent...

305
00:24:08,144 --> 00:24:12,046
...of another Greek name: Cleopatra.

306
00:24:12,815 --> 00:24:17,047
So here we have
the Cleopatra cartouche.

307
00:24:17,253 --> 00:24:20,620
And here, the Ptolemaeus cartouche.

308
00:24:20,823 --> 00:24:24,350
Here, we've turned it around,
changing left to right...

309
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:28,496
...to right to left, and spread the
hieroglyphs out so we see them all.

310
00:24:28,865 --> 00:24:33,199
Now, immediately we notice that
there are some similarities.

311
00:24:33,402 --> 00:24:36,769
This first hieroglyph in Ptolemy
is a kind of square.

312
00:24:36,973 --> 00:24:40,500
The fifth hieroglyph in Cleopatra
is a square.

313
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:44,138
But "Cleopatra"...

314
00:24:44,347 --> 00:24:46,781
Both of them seem to represent a "p."

315
00:24:46,983 --> 00:24:50,612
So Ptolemy and Cleopatra...

316
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:53,220
...both give us
the same interpretation:

317
00:24:53,422 --> 00:24:56,050
A square is a "p."

318
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:59,294
Likewise, the fourth hieroglyph...

319
00:24:59,495 --> 00:25:02,020
...in Ptolemy is a lion.

320
00:25:02,231 --> 00:25:04,597
"P-t-o-I."

321
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:09,464
Likewise, the second hieroglyph
in Cleopatra is an "I."

322
00:25:10,273 --> 00:25:14,300
So again it's consistent.
The pattern is emerging.

323
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:18,207
Likewise, this rope or
hangman's noose...

324
00:25:18,414 --> 00:25:21,178
..."Ptolemy." It's an "o."

325
00:25:21,384 --> 00:25:24,046
"Cleopatra." It's an "o."

326
00:25:24,253 --> 00:25:28,451
And in this way, Champollion
was able to assign...

327
00:25:29,458 --> 00:25:34,395
...letters for each of
the hieroglyphs we see here.

328
00:25:36,032 --> 00:25:38,000
"Ptolemaeus."

329
00:25:38,334 --> 00:25:40,529
And, likewise...

330
00:25:40,736 --> 00:25:44,467
..."Cleopatra."

331
00:25:44,674 --> 00:25:47,802
The eagle is an "a."

332
00:25:48,511 --> 00:25:51,139
Notice there are two different
symbols for "t."

333
00:25:51,347 --> 00:25:54,077
But in English, the same sort
of thing, "f" and "ph."

334
00:25:54,984 --> 00:25:57,509
Champollion discovered that
the hieroglyphics...

335
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,813
...were a simple substitution cipher.

336
00:26:00,022 --> 00:26:02,582
Now, there's other stuff in here.

337
00:26:02,792 --> 00:26:05,352
All the rest of this:
What's that about?

338
00:26:05,561 --> 00:26:07,586
Well, he was later able to find out...

339
00:26:07,797 --> 00:26:10,527
...this is a symbol called
the "ankh" which means "life."

340
00:26:10,733 --> 00:26:14,328
There's a "pt." That's an "ah."
It makes "Ptah"...

341
00:26:14,537 --> 00:26:15,834
...name of a god.

342
00:26:16,038 --> 00:26:18,063
And the whole cartouche read:

343
00:26:18,274 --> 00:26:21,175
"Ptolemy, ever living...

344
00:26:21,377 --> 00:26:23,937
...beloved of the god, Ptah."

345
00:26:24,146 --> 00:26:26,944
And the end of the "Cleopatra"
is a short form...

346
00:26:27,149 --> 00:26:29,617
...meaning "Daughter of Isis."

347
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:34,256
So it turns out that Champollion's
opponents were not wholly wrong.

348
00:26:34,457 --> 00:26:38,325
Some of the hieroglyphs, for example,
the symbol "ankh"...

349
00:26:38,527 --> 00:26:42,361
...which means life, are ideograms
or pictograms.

350
00:26:42,565 --> 00:26:44,999
But the key to the enterprise...

351
00:26:45,201 --> 00:26:48,364
...Champollion's success, rested
on his realization...

352
00:26:48,571 --> 00:26:53,201
...that the hieroglyphs were
essentially letters and syllables.

353
00:26:53,409 --> 00:26:55,934
In retrospect, it sounds almost easy.

354
00:26:56,145 --> 00:27:00,707
But it took people hundreds of years
before they figured it out.

355
00:27:02,118 --> 00:27:07,021
Champollion walked these halls and
casually read the inscriptions...

356
00:27:07,223 --> 00:27:09,191
...which had mystified everybody else.

357
00:27:09,392 --> 00:27:13,488
Answering the question he had
posed as a child to Fourier:

358
00:27:13,696 --> 00:27:15,664
"What do they mean? "

359
00:27:16,298 --> 00:27:18,789
What a joy it must have
been for him...

360
00:27:19,001 --> 00:27:23,938
...to open this one-way communications
channel with another civilization...

361
00:27:24,206 --> 00:27:29,007
...to permit a culture which
had been mute for millennia...

362
00:27:29,211 --> 00:27:33,477
...to speak of its history,
magic, medicine...

363
00:27:33,683 --> 00:27:37,244
...religion, politics, philosophy.

364
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,368
Today, we also are seeking messages...

365
00:27:53,569 --> 00:27:56,333
...from an ancient and
exotic civilization.

366
00:27:56,539 --> 00:27:58,598
A civilization hidden from us...

367
00:27:59,909 --> 00:28:03,310
...not in time, but in space.

368
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:09,040
Today, we are searching for
a message from the stars.

369
00:28:09,251 --> 00:28:13,551
We have not found it so far.
We have, as yet, no Champollion.

370
00:28:13,756 --> 00:28:15,155
But we are just beginning.

371
00:28:15,357 --> 00:28:20,260
Perhaps those who will decipher the
first interstellar communications...

372
00:28:20,463 --> 00:28:25,366
...are alive at this moment,
somewhere on the planet Earth.

373
00:28:29,438 --> 00:28:32,771
Extraterrestrial beings will
have a different biology...

374
00:28:32,975 --> 00:28:35,842
...a different culture,
a different language.

375
00:28:36,045 --> 00:28:38,912
How could we possibly understand
their messages?

376
00:28:39,115 --> 00:28:42,983
Is there in any sense
a cosmic Rosetta Stone?

377
00:28:45,254 --> 00:28:46,516
I believe there is.

378
00:28:46,722 --> 00:28:51,216
All the technical civilizations in
the cosmos, no matter how different...

379
00:28:51,427 --> 00:28:53,691
...must have one language in common:

380
00:28:53,896 --> 00:28:56,956
The language called "science."

381
00:28:59,068 --> 00:29:03,004
The laws of nature are
everywhere the same.

382
00:29:05,941 --> 00:29:10,742
Every chemical element has
a specific signature in the spectrum.

383
00:29:10,946 --> 00:29:14,939
So there are identical patterns in the
light of a candle flame on Earth...

384
00:29:15,151 --> 00:29:18,052
...and in the light of
a distant galaxy.

385
00:29:20,422 --> 00:29:22,754
The spectra show not only...

386
00:29:22,958 --> 00:29:26,018
...that the same chemical elements
exist throughout space...

387
00:29:26,228 --> 00:29:30,358
...but also that the same
laws of quantum mechanics...

388
00:29:30,566 --> 00:29:32,227
...govern atoms everywhere.

389
00:29:32,434 --> 00:29:34,425
Beings growing up on any world...

390
00:29:34,637 --> 00:29:38,198
...must come to grips with
the identical laws of nature.

391
00:29:40,976 --> 00:29:45,913
Galaxies billions of light-years
distant evolve a spiral form.

392
00:29:46,182 --> 00:29:47,877
So does our own Milky Way.

393
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:51,746
The same gravitational forces
are at work.

394
00:29:52,588 --> 00:29:53,953
And on planets also:

395
00:29:54,156 --> 00:29:58,286
There are spiral storm
systems on Jupiter.

396
00:30:00,196 --> 00:30:03,393
The same patterns are common on Earth.

397
00:30:05,367 --> 00:30:08,962
The intelligent beings on every
world will, sooner or later...

398
00:30:09,171 --> 00:30:11,537
...understand the laws of nature.

399
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:14,106
Someday, perhaps soon...

400
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:18,508
...a message from the depths of space
may arrive on our small world.

401
00:30:18,714 --> 00:30:20,648
If we wish to understand it...

402
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:24,513
...we first have to understand
science.

403
00:30:31,727 --> 00:30:35,356
We do not expect an advanced
technical civilization...

404
00:30:35,564 --> 00:30:38,328
...on any other planet
of our solar system.

405
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:45,630
If they were only a little behind us,
10,000 years, say...

406
00:30:45,841 --> 00:30:48,867
...they would have no advanced
technology at all.

407
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,377
If they're a little ahead of us...

408
00:30:53,582 --> 00:30:57,143
...we who are already exploring
the solar system...

409
00:30:57,353 --> 00:30:59,344
...then they should be here by now.

410
00:31:00,322 --> 00:31:02,483
To communicate with other
civilizations...

411
00:31:02,691 --> 00:31:05,717
...our technology must reach across
not merely...

412
00:31:05,928 --> 00:31:08,362
...interplanetary distances...

413
00:31:08,564 --> 00:31:11,362
...but interstellar distances.

414
00:31:15,638 --> 00:31:17,936
Ideally, the method
should be inexpensive.

415
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:23,077
A huge amount of information could
be sent and received at little cost.

416
00:31:25,481 --> 00:31:26,448
It should be fast...

417
00:31:26,649 --> 00:31:30,517
...so an interstellar dialogue
is eventually possible.

418
00:31:31,487 --> 00:31:32,647
It ought to be obvious...

419
00:31:32,855 --> 00:31:36,757
...so that any technical civilization,
no matter its evolutionary path...

420
00:31:36,959 --> 00:31:39,120
...will discover it early.

421
00:31:41,196 --> 00:31:43,960
Surprisingly, there is such a method.

422
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:47,101
It's called radio astronomy.

423
00:31:50,005 --> 00:31:53,805
This is the largest
radio/radar telescope...

424
00:31:54,009 --> 00:31:58,070
...on the planet Earth,
the Arecibo Observatory.

425
00:32:00,883 --> 00:32:05,047
It's located in a remote valley
on the island of Puerto Rico.

426
00:32:07,957 --> 00:32:11,757
It sends and receives radio signals.

427
00:32:12,061 --> 00:32:14,256
But it's so large and powerful...

428
00:32:14,463 --> 00:32:17,296
...it can communicate with
an identical radio telescope...

429
00:32:17,499 --> 00:32:20,593
...15,000 light-years away...

430
00:32:20,803 --> 00:32:24,796
...halfway to the center
of the Milky Way galaxy.

431
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:32,247
The Arecibo Observatory has been
used, although sparingly...

432
00:32:32,448 --> 00:32:35,679
...to search for signals
from civilizations in space...

433
00:32:35,884 --> 00:32:37,875
...and, just once...

434
00:32:38,087 --> 00:32:42,023
...to broadcast a message
to a distant star cluster...

435
00:32:42,224 --> 00:32:45,091
...called "M13."

436
00:32:49,565 --> 00:32:52,227
But is there anyone out there
to talk to?

437
00:32:55,771 --> 00:32:59,832
With 400 billion stars in
the Milky Way galaxy alone...

438
00:33:00,042 --> 00:33:03,603
...could ours be the only one
with an inhabited planet?

439
00:33:06,348 --> 00:33:07,872
How much more likely it is...

440
00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:12,952
...that the galaxy is throbbing and
humming with advanced societies.

441
00:33:13,155 --> 00:33:16,682
Perhaps near one of those
pinpoints of light in our night sky...

442
00:33:16,892 --> 00:33:19,224
...someone quite different from us...

443
00:33:19,428 --> 00:33:22,761
...is glancing idly at
the star we call the sun...

444
00:33:22,965 --> 00:33:25,627
...and entertaining,
just for a moment...

445
00:33:25,834 --> 00:33:28,769
...an outrageous speculation.

446
00:33:39,114 --> 00:33:42,675
There are an enormous number
of stars.

447
00:33:44,286 --> 00:33:47,722
Only some of them will have
planets suitable for life.

448
00:33:49,458 --> 00:33:53,292
On only some of those worlds
will intelligence arise.

449
00:33:54,496 --> 00:33:57,693
And perhaps a few of those
civilizations will avoid...

450
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:02,633
...the trap jointly set by their
technology and their passions.

451
00:34:05,507 --> 00:34:10,035
If there are many civilizations,
one of them should be rather close by.

452
00:34:11,246 --> 00:34:13,407
If there are few civilizations...

453
00:34:13,615 --> 00:34:17,312
...then even the nearest
may be very far away.

454
00:34:26,528 --> 00:34:31,227
This is one of the great questions:
How many advanced civilizations...

455
00:34:31,433 --> 00:34:35,426
...capable at least of radio astronomy
are there in the Milky Way galaxy?

456
00:34:35,671 --> 00:34:40,608
Let's call the number of such
civilizations by capital letter "N."

457
00:34:41,009 --> 00:34:43,534
It's a number.
It depends on many things.

458
00:34:43,745 --> 00:34:46,305
It depends on the number
of stars in the Milky Way.

459
00:34:46,515 --> 00:34:49,245
Let's call that N sub-star.

460
00:34:49,451 --> 00:34:51,749
The fraction of stars
that have planets...

461
00:34:51,954 --> 00:34:54,354
...is called f sub-p.

462
00:34:54,857 --> 00:34:58,088
The average number of planets
in a given solar system...

463
00:34:58,293 --> 00:35:00,557
...ecologically suitable for life...

464
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:03,724
...is called n sub-e.

465
00:35:03,932 --> 00:35:07,925
The fraction of suitable planets
in which life actually arises...

466
00:35:08,137 --> 00:35:09,968
...is called f sub-I.

467
00:35:10,172 --> 00:35:12,436
The fraction of inhabited planets...

468
00:35:12,641 --> 00:35:14,734
...on which intelligence emerges...

469
00:35:14,943 --> 00:35:16,911
...is called f sub-i.

470
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:22,408
On the fraction of those planets in
which the intelligent beings evolve...

471
00:35:22,618 --> 00:35:25,712
...a technical, communicative
civilization...

472
00:35:25,921 --> 00:35:27,320
...call that f sub-c.

473
00:35:27,756 --> 00:35:32,125
Finally, it depends on the fraction
of a planet's lifetime...

474
00:35:32,327 --> 00:35:35,922
...that's graced by
a technical civilization.

475
00:35:36,131 --> 00:35:37,689
Call that f sub-L.

476
00:35:40,302 --> 00:35:43,362
If we multiply all these
numbers together...

477
00:35:43,572 --> 00:35:47,099
...we've estimated N,
the number of civilizations.

478
00:35:47,643 --> 00:35:50,737
This equation, due mainly to
Frank Drake of Cornell...

479
00:35:50,946 --> 00:35:52,607
...is only a sentence.

480
00:35:52,814 --> 00:35:55,442
The verb is "equals."

481
00:35:55,651 --> 00:35:59,985
So let's try to go through
the program of this equation.

482
00:36:00,189 --> 00:36:02,783
By carefully counting
the number of stars...

483
00:36:02,991 --> 00:36:05,858
...in small but representative regions
of the sky...

484
00:36:06,061 --> 00:36:09,758
...we find that the total number
of stars in the Milky Way...

485
00:36:09,965 --> 00:36:14,868
...is about 400 billion.

486
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:16,867
That's a lot of stars.

487
00:36:17,072 --> 00:36:18,403
What about planets?

488
00:36:18,607 --> 00:36:21,974
Well, in studies of double stars...

489
00:36:22,177 --> 00:36:26,477
...and investigations of
the motions of nearby stars...

490
00:36:26,682 --> 00:36:28,479
...and in many theoretical studies...

491
00:36:28,684 --> 00:36:33,280
...we get a strong hint that many...

492
00:36:33,488 --> 00:36:35,456
...perhaps even most stars...

493
00:36:35,657 --> 00:36:37,249
...are accompanied by planets.

494
00:36:37,459 --> 00:36:39,689
So let's take f sub-p...

495
00:36:39,895 --> 00:36:44,559
...the fraction of stars that
have planets as a quarter.

496
00:36:45,434 --> 00:36:48,631
Then, the total number of
planetary systems in the galaxy...

497
00:36:48,837 --> 00:36:51,829
...is 400 billion times a quarter...

498
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,099
...or 100 billion.

499
00:36:54,309 --> 00:36:58,302
We'll write down our running totals
in red.

500
00:36:58,914 --> 00:37:01,041
Now if each system were
to have, say...

501
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:05,346
...ten planets as ours does, there
would be 100 billion times ten...

502
00:37:05,554 --> 00:37:07,852
...or a trillion worlds in the galaxy.

503
00:37:08,056 --> 00:37:12,516
A vast arena for the cosmic drama.

504
00:37:12,961 --> 00:37:14,690
In our own solar system...

505
00:37:14,896 --> 00:37:18,263
...there are several bodies that
might be suitable for life...

506
00:37:18,467 --> 00:37:19,627
...life of some sort.

507
00:37:19,835 --> 00:37:21,598
There's the Earth, of course...

508
00:37:21,803 --> 00:37:26,240
...but there are possibilities for
Mars, for Titan, perhaps for Jupiter.

509
00:37:26,441 --> 00:37:30,969
If other systems are similar, there
may be many suitable worlds per system.

510
00:37:31,179 --> 00:37:33,511
But to be conservative,
let's choose...

511
00:37:33,715 --> 00:37:36,081
...n sub-e equal two.

512
00:37:36,285 --> 00:37:38,446
Two worlds suitable for life
per system.

513
00:37:38,754 --> 00:37:41,018
The planets that are
suitable for life...

514
00:37:41,223 --> 00:37:44,420
...would be 100 billion times
two, or 200 billion.

515
00:37:44,893 --> 00:37:46,360
Now what about life?

516
00:37:46,561 --> 00:37:48,586
Under very general
cosmic conditions...

517
00:37:48,797 --> 00:37:53,666
...the molecules of life are readily
made and spontaneously self-assemble.

518
00:37:53,869 --> 00:37:57,305
It's conceivable there might be
some impediment, like some...

519
00:37:57,506 --> 00:38:00,236
...difficulty in the origin of
the genetic code, say.

520
00:38:00,442 --> 00:38:04,071
Although that's very unlikely, given
billions of years for evolution.

521
00:38:04,279 --> 00:38:08,613
On the Earth, life arose very fast
after the planet was formed.

522
00:38:08,817 --> 00:38:11,342
So let's choose f sub-I...

523
00:38:11,553 --> 00:38:16,115
...the fraction of suitable worlds in
which life does arise, as a half.

524
00:38:16,491 --> 00:38:20,985
The number of planets in the Milky Way
in which life has arisen once...

525
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:24,458
...is 100 billion times
two, times a half.

526
00:38:24,666 --> 00:38:26,133
Or again, 100 billion.

527
00:38:28,904 --> 00:38:33,273
100 billion inhabited worlds.

528
00:38:33,942 --> 00:38:37,469
Now the estimates get tougher.

529
00:38:37,913 --> 00:38:40,939
Many individually unlikely events
had to occur for...

530
00:38:41,149 --> 00:38:44,312
...our species and our technology
to emerge.

531
00:38:44,553 --> 00:38:47,545
On the other hand, there might
be many different roads...

532
00:38:47,756 --> 00:38:49,519
...to high technology.

533
00:38:49,725 --> 00:38:51,625
Some scientists think that...

534
00:38:51,827 --> 00:38:55,729
...the path from trilobites to radio
telescopes, or the equivalent...

535
00:38:55,931 --> 00:38:58,456
...goes like a shot
in all planetary systems.

536
00:38:58,667 --> 00:39:00,567
Other scientists disagree.

537
00:39:00,769 --> 00:39:04,364
Let's take some middle ground
and choose f sub-i...

538
00:39:05,073 --> 00:39:06,540
...as a tenth...

539
00:39:06,742 --> 00:39:10,337
...and f sub-c as also a tenth.

540
00:39:10,545 --> 00:39:13,412
Meaning that only one percent,
a tenth times a tenth...

541
00:39:13,615 --> 00:39:17,176
...of inhabited planets eventually
produce a technical civilization.

542
00:39:18,086 --> 00:39:21,578
If we were to multiply
all these factors together...

543
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:25,351
...we would find 100 billion
times a tenth times a tenth.

544
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:29,621
Or one billion planets...

545
00:39:30,432 --> 00:39:34,892
...on which civilizations
have arisen at least once.

546
00:39:35,937 --> 00:39:39,896
Now what percentage of
the lifetime of a planet...

547
00:39:40,108 --> 00:39:43,077
...is marked by a technical
civilization?

548
00:39:43,311 --> 00:39:46,644
Earth has harbored a civilization
capable of radio astronomy...

549
00:39:46,848 --> 00:39:49,408
...only for a few decades,
the last few...

550
00:39:49,618 --> 00:39:52,451
...out of a lifetime of
a few billion years.

551
00:39:52,654 --> 00:39:55,214
It's hardly out of the question
that we might...

552
00:39:55,424 --> 00:39:57,392
...destroy ourselves tomorrow.

553
00:39:57,592 --> 00:40:02,029
If that's a typical case,
then f sub-L...

554
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:06,428
...would be a few decades divided
by a few billion years...

555
00:40:06,635 --> 00:40:10,571
...or one hundred millionth...

556
00:40:10,772 --> 00:40:12,740
...a very small number.

557
00:40:13,442 --> 00:40:16,536
And then, N would be a billion
times a hundred millionth.

558
00:40:16,745 --> 00:40:21,682
Or N may be just...

559
00:40:21,917 --> 00:40:23,748
...ten civilizations.

560
00:40:23,952 --> 00:40:27,012
A tiny smattering, a pitiful few...

561
00:40:27,222 --> 00:40:30,248
...technological civilizations
in the galaxy.

562
00:40:31,426 --> 00:40:33,587
But civilizations then...

563
00:40:33,795 --> 00:40:37,287
...might take billions of years
of tortuous evolution to arise...

564
00:40:37,499 --> 00:40:40,627
...and then snuff themselves out
in an instant of...

565
00:40:40,836 --> 00:40:42,770
...unforgivable neglect.

566
00:40:42,971 --> 00:40:44,461
If this is a typical case...

567
00:40:44,673 --> 00:40:46,436
...there may be few others...

568
00:40:46,641 --> 00:40:49,576
...maybe nobody else at all
for us to talk to.

569
00:40:53,915 --> 00:40:55,746
But consider the alternative:

570
00:40:55,951 --> 00:41:00,217
That occasionally civilizations
learn to live with high technology...

571
00:41:00,422 --> 00:41:04,017
...and survive for geological or
stellar evolutionary time scales.

572
00:41:04,226 --> 00:41:07,389
If only one percent
of civilizations can...

573
00:41:07,596 --> 00:41:10,588
...survive technological
adolescence...

574
00:41:10,999 --> 00:41:15,732
...then f sub-L would be
not 100 millionth...

575
00:41:15,937 --> 00:41:18,167
...but only a hundredth.

576
00:41:18,373 --> 00:41:23,310
And then the number of civilizations
would be a billion times a hundredth.

577
00:41:23,578 --> 00:41:26,843
The civilizations in the galaxy
would be measured...

578
00:41:27,048 --> 00:41:29,278
...in the millions.

579
00:41:30,819 --> 00:41:34,118
Millions of technical civilizations.

580
00:41:38,693 --> 00:41:42,561
So if civilizations do not
always destroy themselves...

581
00:41:42,764 --> 00:41:45,631
...shortly after discovering
radio astronomy...

582
00:41:45,834 --> 00:41:49,099
...then the sky may be
softly humming...

583
00:41:49,304 --> 00:41:51,568
...with messages from the stars...

584
00:41:51,773 --> 00:41:54,867
...with signals from civilizations
enormously older...

585
00:41:55,076 --> 00:41:57,374
...and wiser than we.

586
00:41:59,848 --> 00:42:03,215
If there are millions of civilizations
in the Milky Way...

587
00:42:03,418 --> 00:42:05,409
...each capable of radio astronomy...

588
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:08,748
...how far away is the nearest one?

589
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:18,058
If they're distributed randomly
through space...

590
00:42:18,533 --> 00:42:22,299
...then the nearest one will be
some 200 light-years away.

591
00:42:22,704 --> 00:42:24,433
But within 200 light-years...

592
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:27,802
...there are hundreds
of thousands of stars.

593
00:42:28,009 --> 00:42:30,477
To find the needle in this haystack...

594
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:34,308
...requires a dedicated
and systematic search.

595
00:42:38,019 --> 00:42:42,149
Many cosmic radio sources have nothing
to do with intelligent life.

596
00:42:42,357 --> 00:42:47,294
So how would we know that
we were receiving a message?

597
00:42:50,966 --> 00:42:55,494
The transmitting civilization can make
it very easy for us, if they wished.

598
00:42:55,704 --> 00:42:59,231
Imagine we're in the course
of a systematic search.

599
00:42:59,441 --> 00:43:03,377
Or in the midst of some more
conventional observations.

600
00:43:03,578 --> 00:43:05,478
And suppose one day...

601
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,478
...we find a strong signal
slowly emerging.

602
00:43:08,683 --> 00:43:11,174
Not just some background hiss...

603
00:43:11,386 --> 00:43:15,948
...but a methodical series of pulses.

604
00:43:16,157 --> 00:43:18,557
(SIGNAL PINGS)

605
00:43:19,761 --> 00:43:22,855
The numbers one, two, three, five...

606
00:43:23,064 --> 00:43:26,329
...seven, eleven, thirteen.

607
00:43:26,534 --> 00:43:28,695
A signal made of prime numbers.

608
00:43:28,903 --> 00:43:32,999
Numbers divisible only
by one and themselves.

609
00:43:36,211 --> 00:43:40,580
There is no natural astrophysical
process that generates prime numbers.

610
00:43:40,782 --> 00:43:42,340
We would have to conclude...

611
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:45,883
...that someone fond of
elementary mathematics...

612
00:43:46,087 --> 00:43:48,681
...was saying hello.

613
00:43:49,124 --> 00:43:51,649
(SIGNAL PINGS)

614
00:43:54,562 --> 00:43:58,191
This would be no more than a beacon
to attract our attention.

615
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,800
The main message will be subtler...

616
00:44:01,002 --> 00:44:03,470
...more hidden, far richer.

617
00:44:03,672 --> 00:44:06,334
We may have to work hard to find it.

618
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:14,740
But the beacon signal alone
would be profoundly significant.

619
00:44:14,949 --> 00:44:19,818
It would mean someone has learned to
survive technological adolescence...

620
00:44:20,021 --> 00:44:23,013
...that self-destruction
is not inevitable...

621
00:44:23,224 --> 00:44:26,625
...that we also may have a future.

622
00:44:31,466 --> 00:44:33,866
Such knowledge, it seems to me...

623
00:44:34,269 --> 00:44:37,102
...might be worth a great price.

624
00:44:40,642 --> 00:44:41,609
Very likely...

625
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:44,370
...some new Champollion
would go on...

626
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:48,743
...to decode the main message,
using our interstellar Rosetta Stone:

627
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:52,215
The common language of science
and mathematics.

628
00:44:57,225 --> 00:45:00,456
Think of the glories of
an exotic civilization...

629
00:45:00,662 --> 00:45:02,926
...far more advanced than we...

630
00:45:03,131 --> 00:45:07,363
...collected by the great
radio telescopes of Earth.

631
00:45:07,569 --> 00:45:12,472
Perhaps they'd send a compilation of
the knowledge of a million worlds:

632
00:45:12,674 --> 00:45:15,666
The Encyclopedia Galactica.

633
00:45:19,781 --> 00:45:21,806
Receiving an interstellar message...

634
00:45:22,016 --> 00:45:24,644
...would be a major event
in human history...

635
00:45:24,853 --> 00:45:29,790
...and the beginning of the
deprovincialization of our planet.

636
00:45:36,164 --> 00:45:38,860
A serious and systematic
radio search...

637
00:45:39,067 --> 00:45:43,094
...for extraterrestrial
civilizations may come soon.

638
00:45:43,304 --> 00:45:46,467
Preliminary steps are being taken
both in the United States...

639
00:45:46,674 --> 00:45:48,835
...and in the Soviet Union.

640
00:45:50,578 --> 00:45:52,705
It's comparatively inexpensive.

641
00:45:52,914 --> 00:45:57,851
A search taking decades would cost
less than the budget overruns...

642
00:45:58,052 --> 00:46:02,386
...on a single modest weapons system
in a single year.

643
00:46:05,093 --> 00:46:08,551
Our technology is now
fully adequate...

644
00:46:08,763 --> 00:46:10,788
...for this great challenge.

645
00:46:10,999 --> 00:46:13,160
But no systematic search program...

646
00:46:13,368 --> 00:46:17,236
...has ever been approved
by any nation on Earth.

647
00:46:20,275 --> 00:46:22,903
When will we decide to search for...

648
00:46:23,111 --> 00:46:27,844
...what other civilizations there
may be in the vast cosmic ocean?

649
00:46:33,555 --> 00:46:37,423
But whether there are only a few
advanced galactic civilizations...

650
00:46:37,625 --> 00:46:38,922
...or millions...

651
00:46:39,127 --> 00:46:43,325
...shouldn't some of them
have voyaged to Earth?

652
00:46:48,803 --> 00:46:53,172
On one hand, if even a small fraction
of technical civilizations...

653
00:46:53,374 --> 00:46:57,105
...learned to live with their
potential for self-destruction...

654
00:46:57,312 --> 00:47:00,475
...there should be enormous
numbers of them in the galaxy.

655
00:47:01,049 --> 00:47:05,543
On the other hand, despite claims
about UFOs and ancient astronauts...

656
00:47:05,753 --> 00:47:09,814
...there's no creditable evidence that
Earth has been visited, now or ever.

657
00:47:10,291 --> 00:47:12,521
But isn't this a contradiction?

658
00:47:12,727 --> 00:47:16,527
If the nearest civilization is,
say, 200 light-years away...

659
00:47:16,731 --> 00:47:20,132
...it'd take them only 200 years
to get from there to here...

660
00:47:20,335 --> 00:47:21,563
...at light speed.

661
00:47:21,769 --> 00:47:24,863
Even if they were traveling
1000 times slower than that...

662
00:47:25,073 --> 00:47:27,940
...aliens could've come here during...

663
00:47:28,142 --> 00:47:30,372
...the tenure of human beings
on Earth.

664
00:47:30,578 --> 00:47:32,443
So why aren't they here?

665
00:47:33,314 --> 00:47:36,147
There's many possible answers.
One is that...

666
00:47:36,351 --> 00:47:37,943
...maybe we're the first.

667
00:47:38,152 --> 00:47:41,019
Some technical civilization
has to be first...

668
00:47:41,222 --> 00:47:43,622
...to emerge in the history
of the galaxy.

669
00:47:43,825 --> 00:47:48,319
Or maybe all technical civilizations
promptly destroy themselves.

670
00:47:48,529 --> 00:47:50,895
That seems to me very unlikely.

671
00:47:51,099 --> 00:47:53,294
Maybe there's some problem
with space flight...

672
00:47:53,501 --> 00:47:56,026
...that we've been too dumb
to figure out.

673
00:47:56,237 --> 00:48:00,537
Or maybe they are here,
but in hiding...

674
00:48:00,742 --> 00:48:03,336
...because of an ethic of
non-interference...

675
00:48:03,544 --> 00:48:05,409
...with emerging civilizations.

676
00:48:05,613 --> 00:48:09,743
We might imagine them,
curious and dispassionate...

677
00:48:09,951 --> 00:48:13,387
...watching us to determine
whether this year again...

678
00:48:13,588 --> 00:48:15,613
...we manage to avoid
self-destruction.

679
00:48:16,491 --> 00:48:21,394
But there's another explanation which
is consistent with what we know.

680
00:48:21,629 --> 00:48:25,030
And that's that it's a big cosmos.

681
00:48:25,233 --> 00:48:29,829
If years ago, an advanced interstellar
spacefaring civilization emerged...

682
00:48:30,038 --> 00:48:33,007
...200 light-years away,
why would they come here?

683
00:48:33,374 --> 00:48:36,172
They'd have no reason to think
the Earth was special.

684
00:48:36,377 --> 00:48:41,041
There are no signs of technology,
not even our radio transmissions...

685
00:48:41,249 --> 00:48:43,945
...which have had time
to go 200 light-years.

686
00:48:44,152 --> 00:48:47,383
From their point of view,
all nearby planetary systems...

687
00:48:47,588 --> 00:48:51,024
...might seem equally attractive
for exploration.

688
00:48:54,529 --> 00:48:58,124
How would an interstellar
civilization set out to explore...

689
00:48:58,333 --> 00:49:00,961
...its neighboring star systems?

690
00:49:02,003 --> 00:49:04,267
It might establish staging posts...

691
00:49:04,472 --> 00:49:07,202
...colonies,
on planets of nearby stars.

692
00:49:07,408 --> 00:49:09,035
But this would take time.

693
00:49:09,243 --> 00:49:12,076
Time to find and modify
favorable planets.

694
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,441
Time to build new spacecraft.

695
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:19,609
Eventually, later generations
of explorers would set out...

696
00:49:19,821 --> 00:49:21,914
...wending their way
among the worlds...

697
00:49:22,123 --> 00:49:24,785
...creating an interstellar
nervous system...

698
00:49:24,993 --> 00:49:27,052
...binding up the stars.

699
00:49:27,762 --> 00:49:30,822
Perhaps they'd come upon another
expanding civilization...

700
00:49:31,032 --> 00:49:33,500
...and encounter beings
previously known...

701
00:49:33,701 --> 00:49:36,465
...only from their radio
transmissions.

702
00:49:36,671 --> 00:49:38,730
Star wars are unlikely.

703
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:42,808
One civilization certainly would be
far more advanced than the other.

704
00:49:43,011 --> 00:49:45,309
It would be no contest.

705
00:49:48,349 --> 00:49:50,044
Perhaps they would cooperate...

706
00:49:50,251 --> 00:49:55,018
...exploring together a small province
of the Milky Way.

707
00:49:59,594 --> 00:50:03,052
But even nearby civilizations
could spend millions of years...

708
00:50:03,264 --> 00:50:05,323
...roving between the stars...

709
00:50:05,533 --> 00:50:10,470
...without ever stumbling upon
our obscure solar system.

710
00:50:11,806 --> 00:50:15,640
In a galaxy of 400 billion suns...

711
00:50:15,843 --> 00:50:19,540
...perhaps no one has found us
just yet.

712
00:50:21,349 --> 00:50:25,479
Advanced interstellar civilizations
would know about many worlds.

713
00:50:25,686 --> 00:50:28,348
Some inhabited, some barren.

714
00:50:28,556 --> 00:50:30,888
Perhaps they would share
their findings...

715
00:50:31,092 --> 00:50:34,186
...assembling some vast repository...

716
00:50:34,395 --> 00:50:37,364
...of the knowledge of
countless worlds.

717
00:50:37,565 --> 00:50:42,502
They might compile an
Encyclopedia Galactica.

718
00:50:44,138 --> 00:50:48,199
Suppose we could browse through
that encyclopedia.

719
00:50:54,115 --> 00:50:58,074
We would choose some nearby
province of the galaxy...

720
00:50:58,286 --> 00:51:00,948
...a region that's fairly
well-explored.

721
00:51:01,155 --> 00:51:05,751
And then slowly leaf through
the worlds.

722
00:51:26,647 --> 00:51:29,172
The young Champollion was inspired...

723
00:51:29,383 --> 00:51:32,875
...by reading Fourier's
description of Egypt.

724
00:51:33,087 --> 00:51:34,816
Imagine the impact on us...

725
00:51:35,022 --> 00:51:37,752
...if we could study
a rich compilation...

726
00:51:37,959 --> 00:51:40,257
...of not merely one world...

727
00:51:40,461 --> 00:51:42,224
...but billions.

728
00:52:18,966 --> 00:52:22,959
Just possibly, not too far
from our solar system...

729
00:52:23,171 --> 00:52:25,731
...we might find
a technical civilization...

730
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:28,841
...only a little more
advanced than we.

731
00:52:29,043 --> 00:52:33,207
Let's look them up in
the Galactic Encyclopedia.

732
00:53:10,651 --> 00:53:14,314
What would a civilization
far more advanced than ours...

733
00:53:14,522 --> 00:53:15,989
...be up to?

734
00:53:19,627 --> 00:53:22,118
There may be engineering on a scale...

735
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:25,299
...that dwafts our proudest
achievements.

736
00:53:25,499 --> 00:53:29,333
There may be cultures that disassemble
other planets in their system...

737
00:53:29,537 --> 00:53:32,938
...and reassemble them around
their world to make a ring...

738
00:53:33,307 --> 00:53:36,868
...or a shell with
their planet inside.

739
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:54,127
Imagine the energy crisis of a really
advanced planetary civilization.

740
00:53:54,362 --> 00:53:56,193
They've used up all their fuels.

741
00:53:56,397 --> 00:53:58,524
They depend on solar power.

742
00:53:58,733 --> 00:54:02,362
But their growth is still severely
limited by the energy available.

743
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:05,903
An enormous amount of energy
is generated by the local star.

744
00:54:06,107 --> 00:54:09,804
But most of the star's light
doesn't fall on their planet.

745
00:54:10,011 --> 00:54:13,105
So perhaps they would build a shell...

746
00:54:13,314 --> 00:54:15,179
...to surround their star...

747
00:54:15,383 --> 00:54:19,183
...and harvest every photon
of sunlight.

748
00:54:20,488 --> 00:54:23,423
Such beings, such civilizations...

749
00:54:23,624 --> 00:54:27,116
...would bear little resemblance
to anything we know.

750
00:54:53,454 --> 00:54:58,391
Perhaps someday there will be an entry
in the Encyclopedia Galactica...

751
00:54:58,659 --> 00:55:00,388
...for our planet.

752
00:55:00,594 --> 00:55:03,495
Or perhaps even now
there exists somewhere...

753
00:55:03,698 --> 00:55:07,998
...a planetary dossier, garnered
from our television broadcasts...

754
00:55:08,202 --> 00:55:11,000
...or from some discreet
survey mission.

755
00:55:11,205 --> 00:55:15,642
They may summon up the index of blue
worlds in our part of the Milky Way...

756
00:55:15,843 --> 00:55:18,607
...until they came to
the listing for Earth.

757
00:55:18,813 --> 00:55:21,373
What would they know about us?

758
00:55:26,754 --> 00:55:28,847
What would they think of us?

759
00:55:49,443 --> 00:55:52,970
We have always watched
the stars and mused...

760
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:57,708
...about whether there are other
beings who think and wonder.

761
00:56:00,421 --> 00:56:02,753
In a cosmic setting vast and old...

762
00:56:02,957 --> 00:56:07,587
...beyond ordinary human
understanding, we are a little lonely.

763
00:56:12,466 --> 00:56:16,926
In the deepest sense, the search
for extraterrestrial intelligence...

764
00:56:17,138 --> 00:56:20,266
...is a search for who we are.

765
00:56:28,716 --> 00:56:30,513
Since Cosmos was released...

766
00:56:30,718 --> 00:56:33,915
...interest in UFOs has persisted.

767
00:56:34,121 --> 00:56:36,988
It seems to me that there
are fewer sightings of...

768
00:56:37,191 --> 00:56:39,751
...strange objects in the skies
these days...

769
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:44,693
...and more stories of encounters
with alleged extraterrestrials...

770
00:56:44,899 --> 00:56:48,995
...like the account of Betty and Barney
Hill that we dramatized.

771
00:56:49,203 --> 00:56:52,661
There are still people who claim
to have been abducted by aliens...

772
00:56:52,873 --> 00:56:57,071
...or even sexually abused,
or even impregnated by them.

773
00:56:57,278 --> 00:57:02,215
Best-selling purportedly serious books
have been written about such claims.

774
00:57:02,483 --> 00:57:05,975
But the critical fact remains
that all we have still is...

775
00:57:06,187 --> 00:57:07,415
...just anecdote.

776
00:57:07,621 --> 00:57:10,112
There are no close-up photos,
no artifacts...

777
00:57:10,324 --> 00:57:12,315
...nothing that'd convince a skeptic.

778
00:57:12,927 --> 00:57:15,157
All there are is stories.

779
00:57:15,362 --> 00:57:19,458
And stories just aren't good enough
on a matter of this importance.

780
00:57:19,667 --> 00:57:22,192
I'm still waiting for hard evidence.

781
00:57:22,736 --> 00:57:27,400
The radio search for extraterrestrial
intelligence has been picking up.

782
00:57:27,608 --> 00:57:31,476
In Harvard, Massachusetts, a radio
telescope monitoring 8 million...

783
00:57:31,679 --> 00:57:33,374
...separate radio channels...

784
00:57:33,581 --> 00:57:36,516
...has been scanning the skies
for signals.

785
00:57:36,717 --> 00:57:40,278
This program, called META,
is supported entirely by...

786
00:57:40,488 --> 00:57:43,514
...the Pasadena, California-based
Planetary Society.

787
00:57:43,724 --> 00:57:46,318
Paid for by members' contributions.

788
00:57:46,527 --> 00:57:48,825
A similar planetary society search...

789
00:57:49,029 --> 00:57:53,193
...to examine the southern skies
and the center of the Milky Way...

790
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,834
...is to be performed in Argentina.

791
00:57:56,036 --> 00:57:59,005
These searches are by far...

792
00:57:59,206 --> 00:58:01,902
...the most sophisticated
ever attempted.

793
00:58:02,109 --> 00:58:04,441
A much more sensitive program...

794
00:58:04,645 --> 00:58:08,103
...covering almost the entire
accessible radio spectrum...

795
00:58:08,315 --> 00:58:10,306
...is to be mustered by NASA.

796
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:14,545
The search for extraterrestrial
intelligence is central...

797
00:58:14,755 --> 00:58:18,418
...to our understanding of the universe
and our view of ourselves.

798
00:58:18,626 --> 00:58:20,321
It's well worth doing.

799
00:58:20,528 --> 00:58:22,621
But the simple fact is that...

800
00:58:22,830 --> 00:58:27,096
...while we may consider
extraterrestrial intelligence likely...

801
00:58:27,301 --> 00:58:30,793
...there is as yet
no evidence at all...

802
00:58:31,005 --> 00:58:32,404
...that it exists.

803
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:34,935
The search continues.
