1
00:00:02,007 --> 00:00:04,976
<i>It all started when a time travel
experiment I was conducting... </i>

2
00:00:05,043 --> 00:00:07,978
<i>went... a little caca. </i>

3
00:00:08,046 --> 00:00:11,538
<i>In the blink of a cosmic clock, </i>
<i>I went from quantum physicist... </i>

4
00:00:11,616 --> 00:00:14,983
<i>To air force test pilot, </i>

5
00:00:15,053 --> 00:00:18,454
<i>which could have been fun</i>
<i>if I knew how to fly. </i>

6
00:00:18,523 --> 00:00:21,788
<i>Fortunately, I had help... </i>
<i>an observer from the project named Al. </i>

7
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:26,729
<i>Unfortunately, Al's a hologram, </i>
<i>so all he can lend is moral support. </i>

8
00:00:26,798 --> 00:00:29,790
<i>Anyway, here I am, </i>
<i>bouncing around in time, </i>

9
00:00:29,868 --> 00:00:32,962
<i>putting things right</i>
<i>that once went wrong... </i>

10
00:00:33,038 --> 00:00:36,906
<i>a sort of time-traveling Lone Ranger</i>
<i>with Al as my Tonto, </i>

11
00:00:36,975 --> 00:00:39,910
<i>and I don't even need a mask. </i>

12
00:00:39,978 --> 00:00:41,445
Oh, boy.

13
00:02:03,194 --> 00:02:07,290
<i>This quantum leaping through time</i>
<i>is a lot like going on a blind date. </i>

14
00:02:14,205 --> 00:02:16,332
<i>You never know who</i>
<i>you'll end up with. </i>

15
00:02:16,408 --> 00:02:19,309
<i>Fortunately, I have Al</i>
<i>as my chaperone... </i>

16
00:02:19,377 --> 00:02:23,609
<i>to help me figure out what time I'm in</i>
<i>and when it's time to go. </i>

17
00:02:30,755 --> 00:02:34,088
<i>Thanks, Frankie. </i>
<i>You was terrific. </i>

18
00:02:37,028 --> 00:02:39,189
If I'm lyin', I'm dyin'.

19
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,834
As Al would say, timing is everything.

20
00:02:45,904 --> 00:02:49,601
What did she call me?
Terrific.

21
00:02:49,674 --> 00:02:52,336
No, dummy.
Frankie was terrific.

22
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,106
That's it... Frankie.
She called me Frankie.

23
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,307
Frankie what?

24
00:02:57,382 --> 00:02:59,316
Frankie who?

25
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,685
Frankie. Wow.

26
00:03:11,029 --> 00:03:14,863
Whatever I was here to improve,
it wasn't Frankie's looks.

27
00:03:19,704 --> 00:03:23,504
Aha! So that's what you're
supposed to look like in a tux.

28
00:03:23,575 --> 00:03:25,509
Eat your heart out, Al.

29
00:03:28,012 --> 00:03:30,640
Okay, you got a job to do,
so whatever it is...

30
00:03:30,715 --> 00:03:33,616
Let's get to it, killer.

31
00:03:42,293 --> 00:03:44,318
Mama, how you like Angela's hair?

32
00:03:54,172 --> 00:03:56,106
Dibs on winners.

33
00:03:56,174 --> 00:03:58,108
Oh, hey, Teresa, I don't know.

34
00:03:58,176 --> 00:04:00,371
What, afraid I'm gonna
beat your pants off?

35
00:04:00,445 --> 00:04:03,380
You can beat my pants off
any time you like, Teresa.

36
00:04:03,448 --> 00:04:05,882
You should be so lucky, Segundo.

37
00:04:10,688 --> 00:04:12,622
Ain't that calamari tasty, Nonna?

38
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:16,319
Tastes like a rubber.

39
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,434
Scusa.

40
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:30,566
Give me that.

41
00:04:38,082 --> 00:04:40,983
Who's playing with smooth balls?

42
00:04:42,487 --> 00:04:44,421
Your point, Tony.

43
00:04:46,991 --> 00:04:48,754
Sorry, Gino.

44
00:04:48,826 --> 00:04:50,919
We could've worked this out
for ourselves, Teresa.

45
00:04:50,995 --> 00:04:55,056
How? It's Tony's point, but no one's
gonna say so 'cause they're afraid of you.

46
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:57,397
If I'm lyin', I'm dyin'.

47
00:05:07,012 --> 00:05:08,043
Come on.

48
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:14,247
Buon giorno.

49
00:05:24,963 --> 00:05:28,729
I thought when you showed up
at my daughter's wedding,

50
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,893
you want to be friends again.

51
00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:34,530
I'm here because Angela
asked me to be her beautician.

52
00:05:34,606 --> 00:05:37,973
Now I think you come
to embarrass me.

53
00:05:38,042 --> 00:05:42,342
You're the godfather, Gino.
You don't need to cheat at "bocci".

54
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,548
That's what I like about you.

55
00:05:51,623 --> 00:05:55,286
You talk to me like
I'm some ordinary "gibbone".

56
00:05:59,631 --> 00:06:03,089
Why don't you meet me
at our old place tonight?

57
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:06,000
No.
Ah, come on.

58
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:09,005
I'll talk dirty to you.
We'll have a good time.

59
00:06:14,312 --> 00:06:16,746
You got somebody, don't you?

60
00:06:16,814 --> 00:06:20,648
Yeah. I got a guy who wants to
commit suicide. Who could I have?

61
00:06:20,718 --> 00:06:25,246
Everybody in Brooklyn knows you'll hit
any man over 14 who says hello to me.

62
00:06:25,323 --> 00:06:28,258
Why don't I believe you?
Why start now?

63
00:06:28,326 --> 00:06:30,954
You didn't believe me when I said we
were through either. We're not through.

64
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:33,259
Not until I say so.
Capisce?

65
00:06:37,402 --> 00:06:40,064
You're a piece of work, Teresa.

66
00:06:42,006 --> 00:06:44,839
A real piece of work.

67
00:07:02,727 --> 00:07:05,821
Oh, boy. I'm supposed
to speak Italian.

68
00:07:25,616 --> 00:07:28,380
Bingo?

69
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:37,723
Hey, Frankie, Papa wants you to meet
our cousins from Philadelphia.

70
00:07:37,795 --> 00:07:40,764
They're all doctors.
And Primo wants you to sing.

71
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:44,467
Si...
Sing?

72
00:07:44,535 --> 00:07:47,561
Yeah, sing.
Hey, che cosa, Nonna?

73
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:49,731
Don't you "che cosa" me, Segundo.

74
00:07:49,807 --> 00:07:52,139
That's the only thing you know
in Italian.

75
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,509
Why you don't speak-a good
like your brother Francesco?

76
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,242
I let my lips do the talking, Nonna.

77
00:08:03,121 --> 00:08:06,056
Let's go. Hurry up. Come on.
Primo's waiting. Everybody's waiting.

78
00:08:06,124 --> 00:08:10,754
Hey, everybody! My brother Frankie
gonna sing at my wedding!

79
00:08:15,967 --> 00:08:19,027
So, what do you want him to sing,
babe? You name it, you got it.

80
00:08:19,103 --> 00:08:21,037
Right, Frankie?
Uh-huh.

81
00:08:21,105 --> 00:08:26,737
"Volare. " Please, Frankie.
You sing "Volare" better than Modugno.

82
00:08:26,811 --> 00:08:29,939
Oh, I don't know about that.
Oh, "Volare. "

83
00:08:30,014 --> 00:08:33,814
Come on, baby!

84
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:43,393
Al.

85
00:08:43,461 --> 00:08:46,123
Just sing the song.
We'll go somewhere private.

86
00:08:46,197 --> 00:08:49,132
Then these people won't see you
talking to yourself like a lunatic.

87
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,760
Sing?
Make a noise with your voice.

88
00:08:51,836 --> 00:08:53,633
- I can sing?
- Trust me.

89
00:08:53,704 --> 00:08:56,901
- I don't know the words.
- "volare"

90
00:09:02,713 --> 00:09:05,409
- <i>volare</i>
- "Oh, oh. "

91
00:09:05,483 --> 00:09:08,611
<i>Oh, oh</i>

92
00:09:08,686 --> 00:09:11,120
Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh.

93
00:09:11,189 --> 00:09:14,454
<i>Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

94
00:09:14,525 --> 00:09:16,186
"Nel blu dipinto di blu. "

95
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,785
<i>Nel blu dipinto di blu</i>

96
00:09:18,863 --> 00:09:22,196
"Felice di stare lassu".

97
00:09:22,266 --> 00:09:26,168
"E volavo, volavo
felice piu in alto. "

98
00:09:26,237 --> 00:09:30,333
"Del sole ed ancora piu su".

99
00:09:35,546 --> 00:09:39,539
"Una musica dolce suonava
soltanto per me. "

100
00:09:39,617 --> 00:09:42,882
<i>Una musica dolce... per me</i>

101
00:09:42,954 --> 00:09:47,118
- "volare" again.
- <i>volare</i>

102
00:09:47,191 --> 00:09:50,160
<i>Oh, oh</i>

103
00:09:50,228 --> 00:09:52,287
I got it.

104
00:09:52,363 --> 00:09:54,729
<i>Cantare</i>

105
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:58,667
<i>Yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

106
00:10:00,271 --> 00:10:03,707
<i>Nel blu, dipinto di blu</i>

107
00:10:03,774 --> 00:10:06,174
<i>Felice di stare lassu</i>

108
00:10:06,244 --> 00:10:09,702
<i>volare</i>

109
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:13,978
<i>Oh, wo-oh-oh-oh, yeah</i>

110
00:10:14,051 --> 00:10:16,849
<i>Cantare</i>

111
00:10:16,921 --> 00:10:20,482
<i>Wo-oh-oh-oh</i>

112
00:10:21,726 --> 00:10:24,889
<i>Your love has given me wings</i>

113
00:10:24,962 --> 00:10:27,988
Teresa gave me the slip
for 20 minutes.

114
00:10:28,065 --> 00:10:32,934
<i>Vooooo... </i>

115
00:10:33,004 --> 00:10:36,030
One, two, one, two, three!

116
00:10:36,107 --> 00:10:39,736
See what happens when a
puttana like Teresa walks out on you?

117
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,744
You lose respect.

118
00:10:41,812 --> 00:10:45,908
And when you lose respect,
you lose fear.

119
00:10:45,983 --> 00:10:49,043
That's not true, Don Gino.
Now he tells me I'm wrong.

120
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,057
<i>Vo-o-o-olare</i>

121
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:57,458
- You want me to put Frankie on it?
- No, no. I can handle this, Don Gino.

122
00:10:57,528 --> 00:11:01,157
I swear it. Whoever she's with
is dead meat.

123
00:11:01,232 --> 00:11:05,430
I don't want him dead meat.
I want him singing soprano.

124
00:11:16,213 --> 00:11:18,477
Why do you have to know exactly where?

125
00:11:18,549 --> 00:11:20,642
I don't have to know, pal.

126
00:11:20,718 --> 00:11:23,380
But Ziggy has to know
if you want us to retrieve you.

127
00:11:23,454 --> 00:11:25,786
You're gonna try again? When?

128
00:11:25,856 --> 00:11:28,791
As soon as Ziggy has
the data that he needs.

129
00:11:28,859 --> 00:11:31,419
And I hope it happens
before I melt.

130
00:11:31,495 --> 00:11:35,795
Exactly where did you find yourself
when you popped into '65?

131
00:11:35,866 --> 00:11:39,063
Sixty-five? This is 1965?

132
00:11:39,136 --> 00:11:43,766
Sixty-five!
L. BJ. 's president. Vietnam.

133
00:11:43,841 --> 00:11:46,639
Don't remind me.
But think of the bright side!

134
00:11:46,711 --> 00:11:49,475
Sandy Koufax pitches
a perfect game.

135
00:11:53,351 --> 00:11:56,377
I'm 10, in the fourth grade.

136
00:11:57,855 --> 00:11:59,948
Marcia Green
sits right in front of me.

137
00:12:00,024 --> 00:12:03,016
And you used to dip her pigtails
into the inkwells.

138
00:12:03,094 --> 00:12:05,654
We didn't have inkwells.
Oh, we did.

139
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,096
I used to dip
Hanna Gretz's pigtails.

140
00:12:08,165 --> 00:12:12,295
That was until I discovered it was a lot
more fun to take Hanna into the cloakroom.

141
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:16,363
In the fourth grade?
I was... socially advanced.

142
00:12:17,908 --> 00:12:20,468
I'm so hot.

143
00:12:20,544 --> 00:12:26,483
Sam, I'm sweating off pounds here
I can't afford to lose.

144
00:12:28,552 --> 00:12:31,988
Now, where did you pop in?

145
00:12:37,395 --> 00:12:40,228
Hmm. Was it here?

146
00:12:40,297 --> 00:12:43,494
Hmm. What were you doing, Sam?

147
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:46,866
Why are you so hot?
It's cold in here.

148
00:12:46,937 --> 00:12:48,871
I'm a hologram, remember?

149
00:12:48,939 --> 00:12:51,703
In an imaging chamber
a couple of decades ahead of here.

150
00:12:51,776 --> 00:12:54,836
The imaging chamber
is air conditioned. Isn't it?

151
00:12:54,912 --> 00:12:56,573
Well, not anymore.

152
00:12:56,647 --> 00:13:00,845
Ziggy has shut down
all non-vital electrical systems.

153
00:13:00,918 --> 00:13:05,252
And since he's a computer,
that means no human comforts...

154
00:13:05,322 --> 00:13:09,691
no air conditioning, no TV,
no microwaved taco chips and cheese.

155
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,342
Why?

156
00:13:10,343 --> 00:13:13,423
Because his ego is bigger
than his memory banks.

157
00:13:13,497 --> 00:13:16,864
Ziggy refuses to accept responsibility...

158
00:13:16,934 --> 00:13:19,528
for not being able to get you back.

159
00:13:19,603 --> 00:13:24,370
Sam, it looks like you popped in
just a tad late, huh?

160
00:13:24,442 --> 00:13:27,206
Sort of. How'd you know?

161
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:30,736
Well, Frankie's condition when
he appeared in the waiting room...

162
00:13:30,815 --> 00:13:33,283
left very little to the imagination.

163
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,284
Who's Frankie?

164
00:13:35,352 --> 00:13:37,582
Frankie...
he's a... he's a hit man.

165
00:13:37,655 --> 00:13:40,715
A what?

166
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:43,191
A hit man. You know,
bang-a, bang-a, bang-a.

167
00:13:45,763 --> 00:13:48,789
Hey, I didn't say you were a hit man.

168
00:13:48,866 --> 00:13:51,300
It doesn't make me feel any better.

169
00:13:52,703 --> 00:13:54,728
Who's the girl?

170
00:13:54,805 --> 00:13:56,966
Girl? What girl?

171
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:00,404
The girl.

172
00:14:00,478 --> 00:14:04,278
Oh. Oh, no data. Uh, could have been
any one of a dozen.

173
00:14:04,348 --> 00:14:07,909
Now, Frankie, he's a very
good-lookin' stud, as you know.

174
00:14:07,985 --> 00:14:10,886
Take it from someone who knows.
When you're a good-lookin'stud...

175
00:14:10,955 --> 00:14:13,981
Al. Al. Al! You're gonna have a lot
of girls eating right out of...

176
00:14:14,058 --> 00:14:17,323
What? I'm in trouble here. I'm a Mafia hit man.

177
00:14:17,394 --> 00:14:20,227
- No, you're not. Frankie is.
- You know what I mean.

178
00:14:22,032 --> 00:14:24,933
What, uh...

179
00:14:25,002 --> 00:14:27,937
What am I here to do?

180
00:14:28,005 --> 00:14:31,372
Well, I don't know.
We only did a top line on Frankie.

181
00:14:31,442 --> 00:14:34,502
We didn't have any time
for in-depth research.

182
00:14:34,578 --> 00:14:37,809
Uh, it's on Ziggy's
nonessential electrical use list.

183
00:14:37,882 --> 00:14:39,816
Nonessential?

184
00:14:39,884 --> 00:14:44,082
Look, God or time or whoever the hell it is
leaping me around from one year to another...

185
00:14:44,155 --> 00:14:47,766
is gonna do it again as soon as I change
whatever happened in Frankie's life in '65,

186
00:14:47,767 --> 00:14:48,956
or someone around him, right?

187
00:14:49,026 --> 00:14:51,859
- Correct.
- Wouldn't it be nice to know what that is?

188
00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:54,295
Not necessarily.

189
00:14:54,365 --> 00:14:57,266
Because Ziggy is 97. 3% sure...

190
00:14:57,334 --> 00:14:59,825
that he can leap you back
if both of us...

191
00:14:59,904 --> 00:15:02,464
pay attention to his instructions
down to the decimal point.

192
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,839
What instructions?
Well, you're supposed to do...

193
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:10,279
whatever Frankie would do
until we receive further instructions.

194
00:15:10,347 --> 00:15:14,078
Uh, oh, by the way,
this, I think, is yours.

195
00:15:27,064 --> 00:15:29,692
What if I'm supposed to use this?

196
00:15:29,767 --> 00:15:32,395
Make sure you take the safety off.

197
00:15:33,971 --> 00:15:36,701
That's not funny, Al.

198
00:15:38,275 --> 00:15:40,209
Al?

199
00:15:49,053 --> 00:15:51,180
Okay, come on.

200
00:15:51,255 --> 00:15:55,089
I don't understand you.
Who, me?

201
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:59,357
You just got married yesterday.
Yeah. So?

202
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,921
Didn't Angela want a honeymoon?

203
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:05,628
Let me tell you something.
I gave her her honeymoon last night.

204
00:16:08,405 --> 00:16:12,603
You're sick.
I am? Hey, I look sick?

205
00:16:12,676 --> 00:16:15,236
You're hung-over.

206
00:16:15,312 --> 00:16:18,145
Don't you love her?
Who?

207
00:16:18,215 --> 00:16:20,149
Angela.

208
00:16:20,217 --> 00:16:23,812
Oh. Well, yeah, I like her.

209
00:16:23,888 --> 00:16:27,790
If you only like her,
why did you marry her?

210
00:16:27,858 --> 00:16:30,884
Because you told me
it'd be a good thing to do.

211
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,930
Oh.

212
00:16:34,999 --> 00:16:37,365
Hey, hey, hey! You animal!
Get outta the street!

213
00:16:37,434 --> 00:16:40,426
Up yours. ! Hey, don't
you remember you and Pop said...

214
00:16:40,504 --> 00:16:42,597
that if Primo
was the don's son-in-law,

215
00:16:42,673 --> 00:16:44,800
we could move on the Carlucci’s,
no problem?

216
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:48,003
Yeah.
Huh? What, did you change your mind?

217
00:16:49,713 --> 00:16:53,012
Well, I... I...

218
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,380
Hello!

219
00:16:56,654 --> 00:17:00,590
You know, I could use a haircut.
Maybe she's got an opening.

220
00:17:00,658 --> 00:17:04,116
What, you're gonna get
your hair cut from Teresa?

221
00:17:04,194 --> 00:17:08,062
Teresa. Yeah.

222
00:17:10,901 --> 00:17:13,062
<i>I had the sudden feeling that in '65... </i>

223
00:17:13,137 --> 00:17:15,628
<i>men weren't having</i>
<i>their hair styled by women. </i>

224
00:17:15,706 --> 00:17:18,402
<i>At least not in South Brooklyn. </i>

225
00:17:18,475 --> 00:17:20,874
<i>Maybe I'm here to start
the unisex revolution. </i>

226
00:17:20,945 --> 00:17:22,942
Can I get a trim?

227
00:17:24,982 --> 00:17:27,610
If you have the time,
uh, a little bit off the ears.

228
00:17:29,386 --> 00:17:33,254
This is nice.
It's round and full.

229
00:17:33,324 --> 00:17:35,519
Kind of "beehivey. "

230
00:17:44,101 --> 00:17:46,035
Want to give me
a shampoo first?

231
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,144
Hello.

232
00:17:54,611 --> 00:17:58,012
Hey.

233
00:18:09,493 --> 00:18:10,212
Thank you.

234
00:18:10,213 --> 00:18:13,953
Frankie, what are you trying to
do, get us killed or something?

235
00:18:14,031 --> 00:18:19,401
Trust me, in a year, men everywhere
will be getting their hair styled in salons.

236
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:23,770
Your father may have saved his life,
and Primo may be his son-in-law,

237
00:18:23,841 --> 00:18:26,742
but if Gino finds out about us,
you'll be feeding the fishes...

238
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:28,744
and I'll be wearing
concrete undies.

239
00:18:28,812 --> 00:18:30,871
If I'm lyin', I'm dyin'.

240
00:18:30,948 --> 00:18:34,440
Gino? Like in Don Gino?

241
00:18:34,518 --> 00:18:37,180
Come on, Frankie, be serious.

242
00:18:37,254 --> 00:18:41,554
Look, I wanna be able to lead a normal life
with you too, but this is stupido.

243
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:44,287
I can see that.
Then why did you do it?

244
00:18:44,361 --> 00:18:48,798
Well, I... I saw you in the window,
and it seemed like a good idea.

245
00:18:48,866 --> 00:18:52,996
You mean you got the hots for me
so bad, you don't care?

246
00:18:54,138 --> 00:18:57,403
Well, uh...
Oh, oh, Frankie.

247
00:18:57,474 --> 00:19:00,307
I feel the same way.

248
00:19:00,377 --> 00:19:05,246
I got the hots for you the...
the minute I laid my eyes on you.

249
00:19:05,315 --> 00:19:08,978
You were standing outside
Luigi's Fish Market...

250
00:19:09,053 --> 00:19:11,954
with that big '45 in your hand,

251
00:19:12,022 --> 00:19:15,651
blowing holes
in the Giacanni brothers.

252
00:19:15,726 --> 00:19:20,493
And when you noticed that I was hiding
behind the salted cod and winked,

253
00:19:20,564 --> 00:19:23,499
ah, I knew it was kismet.

254
00:19:23,567 --> 00:19:26,331
If I'm lyin', I'm dyin'.

255
00:19:47,724 --> 00:19:50,989
My condolences on the loss
of your eldest son, paisan.

256
00:19:52,296 --> 00:19:54,924
But, Gino, this is my idea.

257
00:19:54,998 --> 00:19:58,195
Well, you know how women,
they talk in the beauty parlors.

258
00:19:58,268 --> 00:20:02,932
I mean, they say things to each other that they
wouldn't tell their priest on their deathbed.

259
00:20:03,006 --> 00:20:07,102
I figure, well, Frankie goes in there,
maybe gets a haircut from Teresa.

260
00:20:07,177 --> 00:20:11,978
She may for one split second forget
that he's a man, and let something slip.

261
00:20:14,184 --> 00:20:16,709
You live long enough,
you see everything.

262
00:20:16,787 --> 00:20:20,951
Even your most trusted paisan
trying to slip you the salami. No.

263
00:20:21,024 --> 00:20:23,458
No?

264
00:20:23,527 --> 00:20:26,985
You think for one moment
that if Frankie was boffin' Teresa...

265
00:20:27,064 --> 00:20:29,760
that he would be sitting
in that chair in that window?

266
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:34,600
Gino, I swear
on my firstborn grandchild...

267
00:20:34,671 --> 00:20:38,038
Angela told you?

268
00:20:41,211 --> 00:20:44,772
Frankie is not the one
you want singing soprano.

269
00:20:46,483 --> 00:20:50,613
Swearing on Primo and Angela's
firstborn touches me, Tony.

270
00:20:50,687 --> 00:20:53,554
It's very Sicilian. I like that.

271
00:20:53,624 --> 00:20:56,525
So, I'm gonna give Frankie a chance.

272
00:21:00,597 --> 00:21:02,895
Mille grazie, Godfather.

273
00:21:02,966 --> 00:21:08,131
I'm gonna ask him why he's getting his
hair cut in a woman's beauty parlor.

274
00:21:08,205 --> 00:21:12,107
And he better tell me
it was your idea.

275
00:21:15,112 --> 00:21:17,171
Now who's stupido?

276
00:21:17,247 --> 00:21:19,579
And don't talk with your hands.

277
00:21:26,089 --> 00:21:29,547
Woops. Sorry.

278
00:21:32,296 --> 00:21:34,526
Gino! What a surprise.

279
00:21:34,598 --> 00:21:37,829
This is a surprise.

280
00:21:37,901 --> 00:21:40,062
It does seem to attract attention.

281
00:21:40,137 --> 00:21:42,037
Give me a razor, Teresa.

282
00:21:42,105 --> 00:21:44,767
A razor?

283
00:21:49,513 --> 00:21:52,949
You know, the haircut
looks great, Teresa. I...

284
00:21:53,016 --> 00:21:55,883
You haven't had your shave yet.

285
00:21:57,688 --> 00:22:00,782
Actually, I shaved this morning.

286
00:22:00,857 --> 00:22:03,257
Always shave in the morning.

287
00:22:03,327 --> 00:22:06,160
It's kind of a habit, I guess.

288
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:08,357
You got 5:00 shadow.

289
00:22:08,432 --> 00:22:11,401
Women don't like men
with 5:00 shadow.

290
00:22:11,468 --> 00:22:13,436
Well, th-that depends.

291
00:22:13,503 --> 00:22:15,437
On what?

292
00:22:15,505 --> 00:22:17,439
The date?

293
00:22:17,507 --> 00:22:22,410
How about November the 9th, 1965?

294
00:22:23,714 --> 00:22:25,875
Well, see, you got me.

295
00:22:25,949 --> 00:22:29,510
5:00 shadow, uh...
wasn't big in '65.

296
00:22:31,054 --> 00:22:33,784
I meant a straight razor, Teresa.

297
00:22:33,857 --> 00:22:36,485
This ain't a barbershop, Gino.

298
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,528
Go tease some hair.

299
00:22:42,466 --> 00:22:44,400
Frankie.
Uh-huh.

300
00:22:44,468 --> 00:22:47,096
I'm gonna ask you a question.

301
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:51,436
If you answer correctly, all that
happens is you get a good shave.

302
00:22:51,508 --> 00:22:54,773
Why do I feel like
I better answer it correctly?

303
00:22:54,845 --> 00:22:59,145
'Cause if you don't, I'm gonna slice
your throat and cut off your naso.

304
00:22:59,216 --> 00:23:01,650
I was afraid of that.

305
00:23:01,718 --> 00:23:04,209
You ready?

306
00:23:04,288 --> 00:23:06,222
No.

307
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:08,781
I'm gonna ask anyway.

308
00:23:17,701 --> 00:23:20,693
<i>Oh, God, he's asking me in Italian. </i>

309
00:23:36,353 --> 00:23:40,119
<i>Teresa? He wants to know if she's giving</i>
<i>Frankie more than a shampoo and a trim. </i>

310
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,851
<i>What would Frankie say?</i>

311
00:23:41,925 --> 00:23:44,860
- No.
- No?

312
00:23:52,269 --> 00:23:55,329
<i>Maybe that isn't what Frankie would say. </i>

313
00:23:55,405 --> 00:23:58,067
<i>Frankie would say something in Italian. </i>

314
00:23:59,142 --> 00:24:01,235
Volare.

315
00:24:01,311 --> 00:24:03,677
- Volare?
- Hmm.

316
00:24:03,747 --> 00:24:07,376
- Sam.
- Al!

317
00:24:07,451 --> 00:24:09,681
Don't look at me.
Look at him.

318
00:24:09,753 --> 00:24:11,687
You just told him to fly away.

319
00:24:11,755 --> 00:24:15,088
- Che Al?
- I know what he wants to hear,

320
00:24:15,158 --> 00:24:17,353
so you repeat after me.

321
00:24:17,427 --> 00:24:20,885
Albert.

322
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,354
No, don't...
Repeat after me, Sam.

323
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,089
- No.
- No.

324
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:32,397
No.

325
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:57,582
No? Too much for you, huh?
Okay, just say...

326
00:26:05,936 --> 00:26:07,801
That's it.

327
00:26:23,687 --> 00:26:27,418
Getting your hair cut by a woman
is one thing, but by Teresa!

328
00:26:27,491 --> 00:26:31,291
Marrone! Frankie, what
were you thinking about?

329
00:26:31,361 --> 00:26:33,454
It was getting a little long
around the ears.

330
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:36,693
I don't know, Pop. Frankie's
hair's looking really good.

331
00:26:36,766 --> 00:26:39,257
Better than the haircuts
you get at Angelo's.

332
00:26:39,336 --> 00:26:42,169
You don't get your throat cut
at Angelo's.

333
00:26:43,673 --> 00:26:45,971
Ah, well, that was business.

334
00:26:46,042 --> 00:26:49,739
Anyway, I know the godfather
like a brother.

335
00:26:49,813 --> 00:26:53,772
The only reason why he believed you today
is because of the bullet I took for him.

336
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:57,479
Now, until you find the "stugazzo"
that Teresa is cheating with,

337
00:26:57,554 --> 00:27:00,717
Don Gino's gonna be watching you
with a Sicilian eye.

338
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:04,590
The "stugazt" she's cheating with?
What about the cheating that he's doing?

339
00:27:04,661 --> 00:27:07,289
What cheating?
On his wife.

340
00:27:07,364 --> 00:27:10,026
What is he talking about?
Beats me, Pop.

341
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,591
All right, look, just forget it.

342
00:27:14,638 --> 00:27:18,335
Just find the "stugazzo",
and everything will be "va bene"?

343
00:27:18,408 --> 00:27:20,433
Capisce?

344
00:27:21,811 --> 00:27:23,745
Capisce.

345
00:27:25,582 --> 00:27:27,675
Take me home.

346
00:27:27,751 --> 00:27:29,742
What?
Come here.

347
00:27:29,819 --> 00:27:32,344
You make the collections.

348
00:27:32,422 --> 00:27:36,791
And don't forget, you're supposed
to take Nonna to the bingo tonight.

349
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,954
Humor her. She hasn't
won a game in three years,

350
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:42,123
and she thinks you're lucky.

351
00:27:42,198 --> 00:27:45,031
"Stugazt, " bingo. Got it.

352
00:27:45,101 --> 00:27:48,366
Frankie, you okay?

353
00:27:50,173 --> 00:27:53,074
I'm fine, Papa.

354
00:27:55,111 --> 00:27:57,045
Come on. Let's go.

355
00:27:57,113 --> 00:27:59,513
Andiamo. Let's go.

356
00:27:59,583 --> 00:28:03,280
Pop, I've been thinking:
Since Gino's my father-in-law,

357
00:28:03,353 --> 00:28:06,618
I don't think he'd mind
if Teresa gave me a haircut.

358
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,920
Don't think, Primo.
Don't think. It's not for you.

359
00:28:08,992 --> 00:28:11,654
You know, he probably wouldn't care
if you got a perm and a set.

360
00:28:11,728 --> 00:28:14,663
Hey, I got your perm and set right here. Where?

361
00:28:14,731 --> 00:28:16,665
Right here.
Aaah!

362
00:28:16,733 --> 00:28:20,225
My old man was Italian. From Abruzzi.

363
00:28:20,303 --> 00:28:23,067
A regular Hop along "Cassaditch. "

364
00:28:23,139 --> 00:28:25,972
I remember when I was a kid,
my dad and his girlfriend...

365
00:28:26,042 --> 00:28:28,567
used to sneak me out of the orphanage
on Saturday nights...

366
00:28:28,645 --> 00:28:31,239
for a little homemade risotto
and Chianti.

367
00:28:31,314 --> 00:28:34,408
One night, he brought along
this extra girl, and he says to me,

368
00:28:34,484 --> 00:28:37,078
"Son, I think it's about time... "
Al,

369
00:28:37,153 --> 00:28:40,554
I don't have time to hear your stories
about your Hop along Cassidy father.

370
00:28:40,624 --> 00:28:43,991
Cassaditch. Hop along Cassaditch. It's
an expression that goes way back... Al!

371
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:48,190
Al, I'm in trouble here. I gotta leap
out of here before Gino finds out...

372
00:28:48,264 --> 00:28:51,199
that Frankie's the guy beating
his time with Teresa. Capisce?

373
00:28:51,267 --> 00:28:53,633
Look at me.
I'm talking like them.

374
00:28:53,703 --> 00:28:56,729
Teresa! This is the little lady...

375
00:28:56,806 --> 00:29:00,264
you were bingo-bango-bongoing
up in the attic, huh?

376
00:29:00,343 --> 00:29:03,039
Teresa is the lady that Frankie was...

377
00:29:03,113 --> 00:29:05,047
whatever in the attic.

378
00:29:05,115 --> 00:29:09,051
Oh, this is going to make retrieving
you tonight very interesting.

379
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:13,055
Tonight? You're leaping me out
tonight? At 22:28 Greenwich Mean Time.

380
00:29:13,123 --> 00:29:15,057
Great.
Provided...

381
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:17,855
Here it comes.
You follow Ziggy's program.

382
00:29:17,927 --> 00:29:23,297
One: At 22:15 Greenwich Mean Time,

383
00:29:23,366 --> 00:29:27,393
you must plug in
a thousand-watt hair dryer...

384
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:30,530
in a house located
at 111 Erie Drive, Buffalo, New York.

385
00:29:30,607 --> 00:29:34,134
What? Two: At the designated retrieval time...

386
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:36,974
22:28 Greenwich Mean Time,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

387
00:29:37,047 --> 00:29:41,313
You got that. You must be at the exact
same location arrived at yesterday.

388
00:29:41,384 --> 00:29:43,511
Don Gino's attic.
Don Gino's attic?

389
00:29:43,586 --> 00:29:46,646
Whatever.
How can I be in Buffalo at 22:15...

390
00:29:46,723 --> 00:29:49,191
and back in Brooklyn 13 minutes later?

391
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:51,318
I never said it would be easy.

392
00:29:51,394 --> 00:29:54,591
Okay, okay. Um,

393
00:29:54,664 --> 00:29:57,656
I'll get Primo and Segundo
to go to Buffalo.

394
00:29:57,734 --> 00:30:00,828
You'd trust your leap to them?
I'm trusting you and Ziggy.

395
00:30:02,706 --> 00:30:05,800
Three: You must duplicate...

396
00:30:05,875 --> 00:30:09,402
the event that was occurring
when you arrived.

397
00:30:09,479 --> 00:30:13,848
In other words, you have to be with
whomever was present in that attic.

398
00:30:13,917 --> 00:30:18,786
Teresa. And engaged in whatever
activity was taking place.

399
00:30:21,791 --> 00:30:24,521
Geez, I'm hot.

400
00:30:27,263 --> 00:30:29,754
Thanks a lot.
I'll return it to you tomorrow.

401
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:31,960
Come on, hurry up, Primo.

402
00:30:32,035 --> 00:30:35,994
You know, hitting Buffalo I understand.

403
00:30:36,072 --> 00:30:39,132
A hair dryer in Buffalo, non capisco.

404
00:30:39,209 --> 00:30:41,734
Hey, Frankie says we do it,
we do it.

405
00:30:41,811 --> 00:30:45,508
If Frankie says you jump off
the Brooklyn Bridge, would you jump?

406
00:30:45,582 --> 00:30:49,211
No. That'd be stupid.

407
00:30:52,021 --> 00:30:54,012
Yah!

408
00:30:56,126 --> 00:30:58,959
- Teresa.
- Uh, hi.

409
00:30:59,028 --> 00:31:01,553
Frankie!

410
00:31:01,631 --> 00:31:05,294
Teresa, I need to see you tonight.

411
00:31:05,368 --> 00:31:07,996
You mean, after today
you still want to make it with me?

412
00:31:10,874 --> 00:31:14,071
More than ever. But you gotta meet me
by 4:00, 4:30 at the latest.

413
00:31:14,144 --> 00:31:16,078
I don't close till 5:00.

414
00:31:16,146 --> 00:31:19,479
Teresa, this is important.

415
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:22,677
It has to do with the future.

416
00:31:22,752 --> 00:31:25,585
You think we got one?

417
00:31:25,655 --> 00:31:27,748
Of course we got one.

418
00:31:27,824 --> 00:31:30,622
Oh, Frankie!
Where you wanna meet, hon?

419
00:31:30,693 --> 00:31:34,595
- Don Gino's attic?
- Where!

420
00:31:37,567 --> 00:31:40,468
Now, don't panic. Don't panic.
We can sneak up the trellis.

421
00:31:40,537 --> 00:31:42,971
No one will ever know we're there.
I'll know!

422
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:46,907
Teresa, you said I was terrific
in the attic.

423
00:31:46,976 --> 00:31:51,606
Frankie, you're terrific anywhere. But why go
somewhere as stupido as Gino's attic?

424
00:31:51,681 --> 00:31:53,649
Because...

425
00:31:55,418 --> 00:31:58,353
you were terrific in the attic.

426
00:31:58,421 --> 00:32:01,686
In Gino's attic, you were
better than anywhere else.

427
00:32:03,226 --> 00:32:05,160
I was?

428
00:32:06,629 --> 00:32:09,325
If I'm lyin', I'm dyin'.

429
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:11,390
Better than anywhere?

430
00:32:11,467 --> 00:32:13,867
Anywhere.

431
00:32:15,205 --> 00:32:19,301
Better than under the table
at the Sons of Italy?

432
00:32:19,375 --> 00:32:22,606
Under the table...

433
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:26,240
Uh... yeah.

434
00:32:26,316 --> 00:32:31,083
Better than...
beneath the West End El?

435
00:32:33,089 --> 00:32:35,489
Definitely.

436
00:32:35,558 --> 00:32:38,254
Or behind the furnace
at St. Francis?

437
00:32:39,329 --> 00:32:42,196
Behind the furnace?
Uh-huh.

438
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:48,166
Teresa, you were awesome
behind the furnace.

439
00:32:48,238 --> 00:32:49,830
Awesome?

440
00:32:49,906 --> 00:32:52,704
Uh, it's an expression.

441
00:32:52,775 --> 00:32:56,040
Oh. Awesome.

442
00:32:57,947 --> 00:33:00,347
I like it.

443
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,543
Let's be awesome.

444
00:33:05,588 --> 00:33:08,682
In my attic? In my attic!

445
00:33:08,758 --> 00:33:12,194
Si, Don Gino. I watched them
climb up there with my own eyes.

446
00:33:12,262 --> 00:33:14,856
My wife lives there.
My daughter...

447
00:33:14,931 --> 00:33:17,866
Some people,
they got no respect.

448
00:33:17,934 --> 00:33:20,630
Oh, they gonna have respect.

449
00:33:20,703 --> 00:33:23,763
If I don't teach them
anything else tonight,

450
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,104
I'm gonna teach 'em respect.

451
00:33:32,215 --> 00:33:35,241
What's the matter with these
people? Don't they pay electric bills?

452
00:33:35,318 --> 00:33:37,946
This is fraternity row, you idiot.
Their folks pay the bills.

453
00:33:38,021 --> 00:33:40,956
All right. It should be the last one
on the right. That one.

454
00:33:41,024 --> 00:33:42,616
Where?
There.

455
00:33:42,692 --> 00:33:45,991
A&P has a fraternity!

456
00:33:46,062 --> 00:33:49,828
That's Alpha Rho, you idiot!
Primo, it's Greek!

457
00:33:49,899 --> 00:33:54,393
No kidding. I didn't know
A&P supermarkets were Greek.

458
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:57,735
- Come here.
- What?

459
00:33:57,807 --> 00:33:59,741
What time is it?

460
00:34:01,177 --> 00:34:03,111
"What time is it"?

461
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:06,444
I'm hotter than your old man's pepe rosa,
and you wanna know the time?

462
00:34:06,516 --> 00:34:10,384
It's... critical to our future.

463
00:34:10,453 --> 00:34:15,390
Oh, you mean like... like the stars
gotta be in the right place or something?

464
00:34:15,458 --> 00:34:17,722
Yeah.

465
00:34:17,794 --> 00:34:20,490
Yeah, yeah,
that's exactly what I mean.

466
00:34:20,563 --> 00:34:24,158
Betelgeuse in Orion has to be aligned
with the North Celestial Pole.

467
00:34:24,233 --> 00:34:27,293
I didn't know
you knew the stars.

468
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:29,395
Neither did I.

469
00:34:29,472 --> 00:34:33,203
So, where is this Betel...
Betelgeuse.

470
00:34:33,276 --> 00:34:36,006
Yeah. Star.
There, in Orion's shoulder.

471
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:40,379
Frankie, I wouldn't know Orion's
shoulder from his culo.

472
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:44,011
It's that bright red star
just above the trees.

473
00:34:44,087 --> 00:34:48,114
See it?
Oh. Huh.

474
00:34:48,191 --> 00:34:52,389
It's real pretty... like a diamond.

475
00:34:52,462 --> 00:34:57,365
So, what time do these stars
have to get... aligned?

476
00:34:57,433 --> 00:35:00,766
22:28 Greenwich Mean Time.

477
00:35:00,837 --> 00:35:03,101
Huh?

478
00:35:03,172 --> 00:35:05,834
5:28 Eastern Standard Time.

479
00:35:07,176 --> 00:35:11,203
It's a quarter after.
Shouldn't we be getting started?

480
00:35:13,149 --> 00:35:15,811
Come on, Primo.
It's almost 5:15.

481
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:20,581
Hey, what the hell
you think you're doing?

482
00:35:20,656 --> 00:35:22,647
I'm lookin' for a plug.

483
00:35:22,725 --> 00:35:25,319
For what?
For this.

484
00:35:25,395 --> 00:35:28,023
You from the Beta house?

485
00:35:28,097 --> 00:35:32,090
No, Brooklyn. You know
where I can plug this in?

486
00:35:32,168 --> 00:35:35,296
Yeah, I'll show you
where you can plug it.

487
00:35:36,506 --> 00:35:40,442
You can... You can plug it in
right here.

488
00:35:51,287 --> 00:35:52,754
Primo, come on!

489
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:56,683
Hurry up!

490
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,408
Wow!

491
00:36:21,717 --> 00:36:24,880
Did you hear that?
That was my zipper.

492
00:36:30,493 --> 00:36:33,792
What now?

493
00:36:33,863 --> 00:36:36,991
You know I'm supposed to meet
Nonna at bingo.

494
00:36:37,066 --> 00:36:39,466
You're thinking about bingo?

495
00:36:39,535 --> 00:36:41,730
Well, it just crossed my mind.

496
00:36:41,804 --> 00:36:46,298
I'm about to be awesome, and you're worried
about putting the arm on Father Sebastian?

497
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:48,309
What?

498
00:36:48,377 --> 00:36:51,141
Well, ain't that what you're
doing so Nonna can win?

499
00:36:51,214 --> 00:36:53,307
Coerce a priest?

500
00:36:53,382 --> 00:36:56,874
Frankie, what the hell
is going on here?

501
00:36:56,953 --> 00:36:59,615
Nothing.
That's for sure.

502
00:36:59,689 --> 00:37:04,558
I risk life and limb to come up here,
and you're acting like a pinocchio.

503
00:37:04,627 --> 00:37:06,561
Teresa...

504
00:37:09,165 --> 00:37:11,497
I'm not the Frankie you know.

505
00:37:11,567 --> 00:37:13,762
Boy, is that ever right.

506
00:37:13,836 --> 00:37:16,066
I could never...

507
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:20,075
I could never stand outside
of Luigi's Fish Market...

508
00:37:20,143 --> 00:37:23,112
blowing holes
in the Giacanni brothers.

509
00:37:23,179 --> 00:37:26,171
Or make love to you
behind the furnace at St. Francis...

510
00:37:26,249 --> 00:37:28,183
or even cheat at bingo.

511
00:37:28,251 --> 00:37:33,188
And if I can't do any of those things,
I can't lie to you either.

512
00:37:33,256 --> 00:37:35,224
Why stop now?

513
00:37:35,291 --> 00:37:37,919
What do you mean?

514
00:37:37,994 --> 00:37:41,395
Frankie, I know you lie to me.

515
00:37:41,464 --> 00:37:44,763
All men lie to me.
They always have.

516
00:37:44,834 --> 00:37:48,235
They tell me what I want to hear
so they can get what they want.

517
00:37:48,304 --> 00:37:50,636
That's life.

518
00:37:52,775 --> 00:37:57,007
That's wrong. You deserve
better than that, Teresa.

519
00:37:57,079 --> 00:37:59,411
Why? 'Cause I can cut hair?

520
00:37:59,482 --> 00:38:01,780
For starters.

521
00:38:01,851 --> 00:38:05,685
It's a gift, a talent
that makes you special.

522
00:38:05,755 --> 00:38:09,213
You got a lot of things that make you
special, Teresa. You're pretty, you're sweet...

523
00:38:09,292 --> 00:38:13,353
No, Frankie. Don't say it
unless you mean it.

524
00:38:15,598 --> 00:38:17,657
Look, I don't know
about the old Frankie,

525
00:38:17,733 --> 00:38:21,464
but this Frankie is telling you...

526
00:38:21,537 --> 00:38:24,097
you're special, Teresa.

527
00:38:24,173 --> 00:38:26,403
Very special.

528
00:38:29,745 --> 00:38:32,407
God help me, I believe you.

529
00:38:48,164 --> 00:38:50,598
Holy hell!
We just lost Niagara Falls!

530
00:38:50,666 --> 00:38:54,102
Automatic circuits have switched over
to Rochester to pick up the load.

531
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:56,331
Rochester can't handle it.
Override!

532
00:38:56,405 --> 00:38:59,568
It's too late.
There goes Toronto.

533
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,622
Scusi.

534
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:18,387
How is it possible...

535
00:39:18,461 --> 00:39:22,124
that two of mine...

536
00:39:22,198 --> 00:39:24,996
do something
as dishonorable as this?

537
00:39:28,237 --> 00:39:30,228
There goes Massachusetts.

538
00:39:40,316 --> 00:39:44,150
My God! We're losing
the whole East Coast.

539
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:48,418
It was all...
It was all my fault, Don Gino.

540
00:39:48,491 --> 00:39:53,986
That's nice. I like a man
who faces his death with honesty.

541
00:39:56,198 --> 00:39:59,361
I lied to Teresa...

542
00:39:59,435 --> 00:40:02,666
to get her...
to get her up here with me.

543
00:40:02,738 --> 00:40:07,937
I, uh... I wanted to make love to her,
but she refused.

544
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:16,109
Is that so, Teresa?

545
00:40:16,185 --> 00:40:19,154
No. Frankie's lying
to protect me.

546
00:40:19,221 --> 00:40:22,054
But you don't own me.
I can be with who I want to be with.

547
00:40:22,124 --> 00:40:25,150
And I wanted to be with Frankie.

548
00:40:26,395 --> 00:40:30,661
But he wouldn't look at me.
He said it was disrespectful to you,

549
00:40:30,733 --> 00:40:32,894
so I tricked him
into coming up here.

550
00:40:38,374 --> 00:40:41,866
Frankie!

551
00:40:59,128 --> 00:41:02,154
Oh, God.
Now I'm Don Gino.

552
00:41:02,231 --> 00:41:04,893
Frankie, are you all right, hon?

553
00:41:04,967 --> 00:41:07,834
Teresa, hey, you talk
about your earth moving.

554
00:41:07,903 --> 00:41:10,565
- Oh, God.
- Don Gino!

555
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:12,800
What's happening?

556
00:41:12,875 --> 00:41:14,900
Happening?
Nothings happening.

557
00:41:14,977 --> 00:41:17,741
We was, uh...
We was looking for a suitcase.

558
00:41:17,813 --> 00:41:20,179
Uh, Primo wanted us to get
a suitcase for the honeymoon.

559
00:41:20,249 --> 00:41:22,877
Were we hit by lightning?

560
00:41:23,986 --> 00:41:26,147
Something like that.

561
00:41:26,222 --> 00:41:28,596
It's night time.
What happened to the wedding?

562
00:41:28,597 --> 00:41:29,680
That was yesterday.

563
00:41:29,759 --> 00:41:33,058
Yesterday?
You got a concussion.

564
00:41:33,129 --> 00:41:35,359
Lightning can do that.

565
00:41:35,431 --> 00:41:37,695
<i>Either Ziggy's blown it again, </i>

566
00:41:37,767 --> 00:41:41,134
<i>or whoever's bouncing me around in time</i>
<i>isn't letting me off the hook. </i>

567
00:41:41,203 --> 00:41:43,412
<i>I was put here to do something,
and now that I was Don Gino, </i>

568
00:41:43,413 --> 00:41:45,267
<i>I finally knew what it was. </i>

569
00:41:45,941 --> 00:41:50,071
Teresa, do you love Frankie?

570
00:41:52,715 --> 00:41:54,649
Yeah.

571
00:41:54,717 --> 00:41:56,947
And Frankie, do you love Teresa?

572
00:41:57,019 --> 00:41:59,044
Love Teresa?

573
00:41:59,121 --> 00:42:02,113
Godfather, anyone even
looks at Teresa, it's...

574
00:42:02,191 --> 00:42:05,718
What if it wasn't...
Do you love her?

575
00:42:08,631 --> 00:42:13,159
With all due respect, Godfather,
I love her so much it hurts.

576
00:42:13,235 --> 00:42:16,432
Oh, Frankie.
Terrific.

577
00:42:16,505 --> 00:42:19,440
What's best for all of us
is for you two to be together.

578
00:42:19,508 --> 00:42:22,443
The trouble is as soon as I put
you together, I'm outta here,

579
00:42:22,511 --> 00:42:25,241
the old Gino is back,
and you end up like Jimmy Hoffa.

580
00:42:25,314 --> 00:42:27,839
Running the Teamsters?

581
00:42:27,917 --> 00:42:30,249
Wow!

582
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:34,085
I gotta find a way to let all of Brooklyn
know that I approve of your liaison...

583
00:42:34,156 --> 00:42:36,351
a way that Gino can...

584
00:42:39,328 --> 00:42:42,456
a way that Gino can't back out of.

585
00:42:42,531 --> 00:42:44,465
Relax.

586
00:42:53,042 --> 00:42:57,308
Banns of marriage, they
have to be formally announced.

587
00:42:57,379 --> 00:42:59,939
I understand. But, uh,
couldn't you sort of formally...

588
00:43:00,015 --> 00:43:02,483
announce it informally now?

589
00:43:04,386 --> 00:43:06,616
At bingo?
Please.

590
00:43:10,626 --> 00:43:14,494
I have an announcement to make.

591
00:43:16,265 --> 00:43:20,463
Don Gino Frascotti
wishes it to be known that...

592
00:43:22,204 --> 00:43:26,140
Frankie La Palma and Teresa Pacchi...

593
00:43:27,776 --> 00:43:31,872
are to be married...
with his blessing.

594
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:38,284
Gino, grazie. Mille grazie.

595
00:43:38,354 --> 00:43:41,016
If I'm lyin', I'm dyin'.
I'm dyin'.

596
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:44,321
One more thing.

597
00:43:44,393 --> 00:43:46,827
From now on, you're
out of the family business.

598
00:43:46,896 --> 00:43:49,490
I don't care what you do.
Have Teresa teach you how to cut hair.

599
00:43:49,565 --> 00:43:52,830
- But no more banga-banga. Capisce?
- Capisce.

600
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:06,314
Congratulations, Don Gino.

601
00:44:29,872 --> 00:44:33,933
Ladies, if you'll take your seats
now, we'll finish this card.

602
00:44:34,009 --> 00:44:36,876
- Didn't work, huh?
- My idea or Ziggy's?

603
00:44:36,946 --> 00:44:39,915
The both of them
were "flopperoonis. "

604
00:44:42,184 --> 00:44:44,982
Are you warm enough?

605
00:44:45,054 --> 00:44:48,990
Yeah, well, you know... the desert. You
burn up in the daytime. You freeze at night.

606
00:44:49,058 --> 00:44:53,324
It's gonna warm up though, because
Ziggy's gonna turn the support systems back on.

607
00:44:53,395 --> 00:44:55,727
He gave up on me, did he?

608
00:44:55,798 --> 00:44:59,894
Well, he blames you for not following
his instructions down to the decimal.

609
00:44:59,969 --> 00:45:02,631
There's more to it than that.
I'll say there is.

610
00:45:02,705 --> 00:45:06,402
Who ever heard of one lousy hair dryer
blacking out all of the East Coast?

611
00:45:06,475 --> 00:45:09,137
No, that's not what I mean.
Or maybe it is what I mean.

612
00:45:09,211 --> 00:45:12,009
Look, whatever I was put here
to do didn't get done.

613
00:45:12,081 --> 00:45:14,447
And now that I've leaped
from Frankie to Gino,

614
00:45:14,516 --> 00:45:16,984
maybe it can't be done.

615
00:45:17,052 --> 00:45:22,046
Al, what... what if I have to live
the next 40 years as a Mafia don?

616
00:45:22,124 --> 00:45:24,285
No chance, no chance.
How do you know?

617
