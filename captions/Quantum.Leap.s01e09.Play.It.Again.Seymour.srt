1
00:00:12,277 --> 00:00:16,839
<i>Sometimes when I'm quantum
leaping, I have really good days. </i>

2
00:00:16,915 --> 00:00:19,383
<i>Days when I win the race, </i>

3
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,384
<i>stop the bad guy... </i>

4
00:00:21,452 --> 00:00:23,477
<i>and kiss the girl. </i>

5
00:00:34,432 --> 00:00:37,299
<i>And then there are
the bad days. </i>

6
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:47,134
Oh, boy.

7
00:00:47,212 --> 00:00:49,146
Uh, this... this is not
what it looks like.

8
00:00:49,214 --> 00:00:51,148
Uh, he was dead
when I got here?

9
00:00:51,216 --> 00:00:53,980
Mm-hmm. Anybody besides you
and him to corroborate that?

10
00:00:54,052 --> 00:00:57,681
I don't know. Then you're gonna
miss the Dodger opener, Nick.

11
00:00:57,755 --> 00:00:59,780
I'm still in L. A.

12
00:00:59,857 --> 00:01:05,295
"L. A. " Yeah, sure. And, uh, Ebbets
Field is in Hollywood. Call the coroner.

13
00:01:05,363 --> 00:01:08,196
What are you gonna do,
try the insanity plea?

14
00:02:41,392 --> 00:02:44,793
<i>Tales can come true</i>

15
00:02:44,862 --> 00:02:47,330
<i>It could happen to you</i>

16
00:02:47,398 --> 00:02:50,629
<i>It was 1953. </i>

17
00:02:50,702 --> 00:02:56,299
<i>The Dodgers were still in Brooklyn, and I
was a private detective named Nick Allen. </i>

18
00:02:56,374 --> 00:03:00,208
<i>The dead man on the floor
was my partner, Phil Grimsley. </i>

19
00:03:00,278 --> 00:03:03,008
<i>And if that wasn't enough
to cause chills, </i>

20
00:03:03,081 --> 00:03:05,174
<i>there was the image
in the mirror. </i>

21
00:03:07,452 --> 00:03:10,012
<i>Play it again, Sam. </i>

22
00:03:13,091 --> 00:03:15,685
Uh, am I Bogie?

23
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,322
No. No, he's on Long Island with
Audrey Hepburn making "Sabrina".

24
00:03:20,398 --> 00:03:22,559
But the resemblance
is amazing.

25
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:25,500
That might be why Nick
became a gumshoe.

26
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,504
Gumshoe?

27
00:03:27,572 --> 00:03:30,370
Shamus, tec, dick.

28
00:03:30,441 --> 00:03:33,205
You don't know the lingo.

29
00:03:33,277 --> 00:03:35,211
I don't remember.

30
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:37,941
What kind of peep
are you gonna make?

31
00:03:38,015 --> 00:03:40,540
At least I remember him.

32
00:03:40,618 --> 00:03:44,076
Here's lookin' at you, kid.

33
00:03:44,155 --> 00:03:47,591
If you're through playing,
can we get down to business?

34
00:03:47,658 --> 00:03:50,786
Yeah. I'm sorry.
Um, what am I here to do?

35
00:03:50,862 --> 00:03:53,296
Find the killer probably.

36
00:03:53,364 --> 00:03:55,491
Then I didn't do it!
Uh, Nick didn't do it.

37
00:03:55,566 --> 00:03:58,899
Uh, Ziggy says
it's 4-to-1 against.

38
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,234
Your partner Phil
was into seedy divorce cases,

39
00:04:01,305 --> 00:04:03,364
so he was probably
of fed by someone...

40
00:04:03,441 --> 00:04:06,968
he snapshot
in a compromising position or two.

41
00:04:07,044 --> 00:04:09,535
Who? Well, there's no data on that.

42
00:04:09,614 --> 00:04:11,548
You're the shamus.
You figure it out.

43
00:04:11,616 --> 00:04:13,709
I'm not the shamus.

44
00:04:13,785 --> 00:04:15,980
Oh, you know.

45
00:04:20,258 --> 00:04:22,192
You dirty rat.

46
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,728
You dirty, rotten rat.
No, Sam.

47
00:04:24,796 --> 00:04:27,196
You killed my brother...
S- Sam!

48
00:04:27,265 --> 00:04:30,291
That's Cagney, not Bogart.

49
00:04:30,368 --> 00:04:33,098
Yeah. Uh, right.

50
00:04:33,171 --> 00:04:37,073
Yeah, well, I gotta go.
Tina's got this friend.

51
00:04:37,141 --> 00:04:41,043
Al, don't tell me you're
cheating on Tina with her friend.

52
00:04:41,112 --> 00:04:45,446
A friend that knows a guy who's
got a kid that works for a trainer,

53
00:04:45,516 --> 00:04:48,781
who happens to have a sure thing
in the fourth race at Santa Anita.

54
00:04:48,853 --> 00:04:51,185
Now don't you feel bad
about jumping to conclusions?

55
00:04:51,255 --> 00:04:53,189
No, I don't feel bad.

56
00:04:53,257 --> 00:04:56,784
Al, I'm in jail for a murder I didn't
commit in the decade that I was born.

57
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:59,557
All you care about
is getting to...

58
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:04,596
What? What?

59
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:07,536
- I'm gonna be set free.
- By whom?

60
00:05:07,605 --> 00:05:10,472
You!

61
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:13,977
You, you I'm in love with you
Al, don't ask me how I know this,

62
00:05:14,045 --> 00:05:19,415
but any second, a bald detective with
a cigar is gonna come walking through...

63
00:05:19,484 --> 00:05:23,477
That door and tell me that
the bullet that Grimsley took...

64
00:05:23,554 --> 00:05:25,488
didn't come from my gun.

65
00:05:25,556 --> 00:05:29,356
You're outta here, Nick. Ballistics
said the slugs Grimsley stopped...

66
00:05:29,427 --> 00:05:31,452
didn't match your gun.

67
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:33,861
- Déjà vu.
- I don't think so.

68
00:05:33,931 --> 00:05:36,195
Fine, stay here
for all I care.

69
00:05:36,267 --> 00:05:40,169
Uh, no. That's not what I
meant. I wanna get out. Really.

70
00:05:43,975 --> 00:05:47,706
Well, if you're outta here,
I'll see you later.

71
00:05:47,778 --> 00:05:51,680
Al, I...

72
00:05:51,749 --> 00:05:54,912
You've been hit in the head
too many times with a sap, Nick.

73
00:06:16,774 --> 00:06:19,902
<i>In a funny way, that
detective might have been right. </i>

74
00:06:19,977 --> 00:06:24,243
<i>Maybe leaping from one year to another
had done more than Swiss cheese my brain, </i>

75
00:06:24,315 --> 00:06:27,716
<i>because the feeling of déjà vu
had just struck again. </i>

76
00:06:27,785 --> 00:06:31,744
<i>Someone in publishing named
Seymour was about to speak to me. </i>

77
00:06:31,822 --> 00:06:34,120
- Seymour?
- Bogie.

78
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:36,125
Oh, uh, no, ma'am.

79
00:06:36,193 --> 00:06:38,957
He's in Long Island with Audrey
Hepburn and William Holden.

80
00:06:47,338 --> 00:06:47,785
Nick!

81
00:06:47,785 --> 00:06:49,374
<i>I knew them all. </i>

82
00:06:49,374 --> 00:06:52,233
<i>The older guy was Lionel,
the building superintendent. </i>

83
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:56,406
<i>The elevator operator was Chuck, and
Seymour was the boy behind the news stand. </i>

84
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,812
<i>I guess you could consider that
being in publishing. </i>

85
00:06:58,883 --> 00:07:01,511
Sorry about Phil, Nick.
You okay?

86
00:07:01,586 --> 00:07:05,352
I can't believe Phil's gone. Seems like
yesterday that I was taking him up and down.

87
00:07:05,423 --> 00:07:07,414
It was yesterday.

88
00:07:09,594 --> 00:07:11,562
How'd Allison take it?

89
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:15,497
How bad could she take it? A body like
that doesn't marry a guy like Phil for love.

90
00:07:15,566 --> 00:07:17,761
Any idea who killed him?

91
00:07:17,835 --> 00:07:20,827
Word on the street is he was
fogged by a dropper called Klapper.

92
00:07:20,905 --> 00:07:23,840
A dropper called Klapper?

93
00:07:23,908 --> 00:07:25,842
Why would a dropper be
after Phil? Are you kidding?

94
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,606
I bet Phil and Nick put a dozen
Hard Harry’s in the slammer.

95
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:31,671
Any one of them could have paid
a dropper to fog him. Right, Nick?

96
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,684
Well, I-I hope not.

97
00:07:34,752 --> 00:07:38,381
- I don't like tenants with hit men after them.
- No, no, neither do I.

98
00:07:38,456 --> 00:07:40,481
What are you gonna
do, let the cops handle it?

99
00:07:40,558 --> 00:07:44,426
Are you kidding? The man's partner buys it,
he doesn't stop until he nails the dropper.

100
00:07:44,495 --> 00:07:48,932
Like Tommy Trueblood. Tommy's partner
was found in the Pacific, sucking kelp.

101
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,025
Tommy had to take on
the cops, the mob,

102
00:07:51,102 --> 00:07:54,003
and bad criminal elements,
but he got the dropper.

103
00:07:54,071 --> 00:07:56,005
And that's what you're
gonna do, right, Nick?

104
00:07:58,075 --> 00:08:00,737
Well, I-I don't know.
But not here.

105
00:08:00,811 --> 00:08:02,972
I don't want any shooting
around here.

106
00:08:03,047 --> 00:08:05,140
It frightens the tenants.

107
00:08:05,216 --> 00:08:08,379
Well, I'll, uh,
I'll try not to get shot...

108
00:08:08,452 --> 00:08:10,386
here.

109
00:08:17,194 --> 00:08:19,128
Something wrong?

110
00:08:19,196 --> 00:08:21,790
You never paid me
for a paper before.

111
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,299
Well, it's about time I started.

112
00:08:32,943 --> 00:08:35,377
What's the record? Twelve
minutes and eight seconds.

113
00:08:35,446 --> 00:08:37,380
It didn't take that long.

114
00:08:37,448 --> 00:08:39,678
I got a buck says
he can't fix it quicker.

115
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,878
Make that two.
You want a piece of this, Nick?

116
00:08:52,263 --> 00:08:54,356
Gee, thanks, Nick.

117
00:08:54,432 --> 00:08:56,366
You're welcome.

118
00:09:14,485 --> 00:09:16,476
Thanks.

119
00:09:21,292 --> 00:09:27,253
Uh, Nick. I, uh, I got these tickets
to the Dodger game tomorrow, and, um...

120
00:09:27,331 --> 00:09:32,064
Oh, uh, thanks, Chuck, but I don't
think I'll be able to make it.

121
00:09:32,136 --> 00:09:34,070
Oh, I didn't mean you.

122
00:09:34,138 --> 00:09:37,596
I was wondering if maybe you could
ask Allison if she wanted to go.

123
00:09:37,675 --> 00:09:40,269
You know, to take her mind
off Phil's dying.

124
00:09:41,378 --> 00:09:44,870
Yeah, right.
It's too soon.

125
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:46,883
It's a bad idea.

126
00:09:55,593 --> 00:09:59,620
<i>I was still trying to figure out how
anyone could be as tasteless as Chuck... </i>

127
00:10:00,898 --> 00:10:04,265
<i>when the déjà vu
feeling hit me again. </i>

128
00:10:10,741 --> 00:10:13,107
<i>Someone was in my office. </i>

129
00:10:14,378 --> 00:10:17,370
<i>Someone... dangerous. </i>

130
00:10:21,152 --> 00:10:24,053
<i>Boy, was I right. </i>

131
00:10:24,121 --> 00:10:27,056
Oh, Nick,
it's so horrible.

132
00:10:27,124 --> 00:10:29,058
When I found out the police
thought you killed Phil...

133
00:10:29,126 --> 00:10:31,458
Allison. I was so afraid
they'd find out about us.

134
00:10:32,763 --> 00:10:35,163
Oh, boy. I mean, it would be motive...

135
00:10:35,232 --> 00:10:37,166
for you to kill Phil.

136
00:10:37,234 --> 00:10:39,168
Wouldn't it?

137
00:10:39,236 --> 00:10:41,568
Uh, yeah.

138
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:43,766
But you didn't.

139
00:10:43,841 --> 00:10:45,809
No.

140
00:10:45,876 --> 00:10:48,674
Oh, Nick, I'm so glad.

141
00:10:48,746 --> 00:10:52,546
I don't know if I could love
a man who killed my husband.

142
00:10:54,585 --> 00:10:57,019
But if you didn't do it,
who did?

143
00:10:57,087 --> 00:11:00,056
Phil ever mention someone
called Klapper?

144
00:11:00,124 --> 00:11:02,058
The dropper?

145
00:11:02,126 --> 00:11:04,617
You know him?
No.

146
00:11:04,695 --> 00:11:09,997
One night in bed... Uh, you
know we slept in twin beds.

147
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:12,262
Uh-huh.
Yeah.

148
00:11:12,336 --> 00:11:15,305
Well, one night Phil
was having this nightmare,

149
00:11:15,372 --> 00:11:19,240
mumbling something
about a dropper named Klapper.

150
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,369
Is he the murderer?

151
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:26,577
Could be.
Oh, Nick, I'm so scared.

152
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:31,019
I can't go back to my apartment.
I just can't.

153
00:11:31,088 --> 00:11:33,750
Don't you have
somewhere else to stay?

154
00:11:35,192 --> 00:11:37,524
Well, what about your place?

155
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,898
My place?

156
00:11:41,966 --> 00:11:45,993
Well, I-I know
it's a little sudden,

157
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:49,528
maybe in bad taste,

158
00:11:49,607 --> 00:11:51,768
but Phillip's dead.

159
00:11:51,842 --> 00:11:55,073
And we've been waiting
so long.

160
00:11:56,981 --> 00:11:59,745
Waiting?
You mean, we never...

161
00:12:01,051 --> 00:12:06,717
No, of course we never.
Phil... Phillip was your husband.

162
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,724
And your partner.
Yeah.

163
00:12:08,792 --> 00:12:11,192
And a man can't...

164
00:12:11,262 --> 00:12:14,629
With his partner's wife.

165
00:12:14,698 --> 00:12:17,963
Until his partner... is gone.

166
00:12:39,657 --> 00:12:42,990
Thank you.

167
00:13:25,369 --> 00:13:27,303
"I found Phil emptying a bottle...

168
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:31,705
"with a hand shakier
than a grass skirt on Waikiki.

169
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:36,007
"He looked like a cat
working on his ninth life...

170
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,982
ever since he heard a dropper
named Klapper was looking for him. "

171
00:13:41,618 --> 00:13:43,711
It's not déjà vu.

172
00:13:46,323 --> 00:13:48,450
I read this book.

173
00:13:52,997 --> 00:13:55,090
"She was a flamer.

174
00:13:55,165 --> 00:13:58,896
A redhead who could make
Father Flanagan forget Boys Town. "

175
00:13:58,969 --> 00:14:01,301
My first wife
was just like that.

176
00:14:01,372 --> 00:14:04,398
Al. Look, I read this book,
Nick's writing.

177
00:14:04,475 --> 00:14:07,706
That's why I know everything.
It's not déjà vu.

178
00:14:07,778 --> 00:14:11,270
Another illusion
shattered forever.

179
00:14:11,348 --> 00:14:13,475
Nick and Allison
loved each other,

180
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:16,144
but they were too loyal to Phil
to do anything about it.

181
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,154
Listen to this.

182
00:14:18,222 --> 00:14:21,419
"The heat between us was like
a six-day jaunt in the Sahara,

183
00:14:21,492 --> 00:14:25,553
but our ties to Phil were as tight
as the drunk on the corner stool. "

184
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:29,531
- Not exactly Faulkner.
- Yeah, you can say that again.

185
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,434
I think I'm here to find Phil's killer, so that
Allison and I can live happily ever after.

186
00:14:33,504 --> 00:14:36,200
Sam, don't you mean
Allison and Nick?

187
00:14:37,808 --> 00:14:40,368
Well, yeah, sure.

188
00:14:41,812 --> 00:14:45,714
Sam, you know,
Allison could be the killer.

189
00:14:46,784 --> 00:14:48,411
No.
No?

190
00:14:48,485 --> 00:14:51,784
- No.
- No? Why do you say no?

191
00:14:51,855 --> 00:14:55,188
Because "her body
could part the Red Army"?

192
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:59,787
No, because...
we've got Klapper.

193
00:14:59,863 --> 00:15:03,196
Careful, Sam. There was no cure for that in 1953.

194
00:15:03,267 --> 00:15:07,465
Al, Klapper is the dropper who shot
Phil. At least that's the rumor.

195
00:15:07,538 --> 00:15:10,939
Yeah, but people hire droppers.
It wasn't Allison.

196
00:15:11,008 --> 00:15:14,774
But whoever it was
is probably here in Nick's book.

197
00:15:14,845 --> 00:15:19,805
So, if you could just find me...
"Dead Men Don't Die".

198
00:15:19,883 --> 00:15:23,375
Uh, I doubt that it was published
under that title.

199
00:15:23,454 --> 00:15:25,388
Check under Nick Allen.

200
00:15:25,456 --> 00:15:28,448
Maybe he used a nom de plume.
I would.

201
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:31,221
Just have Ziggy do it, okay?
That's what computers are for.

202
00:15:31,295 --> 00:15:34,992
Just find me the rest of this book, because for
the life of me, I can't remember how it ended.

203
00:15:35,065 --> 00:15:37,431
Well, it wasn't with Allison and
Nick living happily ever after.

204
00:15:37,501 --> 00:15:40,698
You read it?
No. But if it ended like that,

205
00:15:40,771 --> 00:15:44,730
why would you be here...
so they could live unhappily ever after?

206
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:56,479
<i>Maybe Al's right. </i>

207
00:15:56,553 --> 00:16:00,182
<i>Maybe Nick and Allison
didn't end up together. </i>

208
00:16:01,258 --> 00:16:03,385
<i>But that was then, </i>

209
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,451
<i>and this is now. </i>

210
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:08,054
<i>And I'm here to see
that they do. </i>

211
00:16:08,132 --> 00:16:12,694
<i>And to do that,
I've gotta find Phil's killer. </i>

212
00:16:18,475 --> 00:16:20,443
Must be Phil's...

213
00:16:31,655 --> 00:16:33,953
Hey, Nick, I got
a lead on the Klapper.

214
00:16:34,024 --> 00:16:36,185
He's gonna be
at the Blue Island tonight.

215
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,627
I read about the Blue... Phil
told me about the Blue Island.

216
00:16:39,696 --> 00:16:42,494
I got tipped by a kid I was in
the orphanage with who works there,

217
00:16:42,566 --> 00:16:45,228
but he couldn't or wouldn't
give me a face.

218
00:16:45,302 --> 00:16:47,395
How are we gonna know
what he looks like?

219
00:16:47,471 --> 00:16:50,804
Same way Tommy Trueblood
did in The Lipstick Murders.

220
00:16:50,874 --> 00:16:54,139
Pose as a couple of mafioso who want to
offer him a contract. You got your roscoe?

221
00:16:54,211 --> 00:16:56,202
- Roscoe?
- Your piece, gat, shooter.

222
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,010
My gun?
Uh, no, the police have it.

223
00:16:59,082 --> 00:17:02,108
That's okay. We always got our
dukes. Ain't that right, Nick?

224
00:17:02,186 --> 00:17:05,349
Yeah, that we got.
Seymour!

225
00:17:29,379 --> 00:17:32,746
Seymour, what...

226
00:17:38,989 --> 00:17:42,948
This can't happen. The doors won't
open unless the elevator's there.

227
00:17:43,026 --> 00:17:45,324
They can if the safety latch
is broken.

228
00:17:45,395 --> 00:17:48,296
Broken?
It happens.

229
00:17:48,365 --> 00:17:50,560
This is your fault.
Mine?

230
00:17:50,634 --> 00:17:53,569
I told you this elevator was old
and needed replacing.

231
00:17:53,637 --> 00:17:55,730
Klapper did it.

232
00:17:55,806 --> 00:17:59,833
I don't think so, Seymour.
Klapper's a pro, and pros rarely miss.

233
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:03,368
Anyway, how could he be sure I'd use the
elevator next, or walk blindly into it?

234
00:18:03,447 --> 00:18:07,611
That was my fault. I distracted
you. I’m always getting in the way.

235
00:18:07,684 --> 00:18:11,780
Look, Seymour, it's not your
fault. I should have looked first.

236
00:18:11,855 --> 00:18:15,416
I've caused accidents since
I was born, probably before.

237
00:18:15,492 --> 00:18:17,790
Maybe that's why
my folks dumped me.

238
00:18:17,861 --> 00:18:22,059
Seymour,
you were abandoned?

239
00:18:22,132 --> 00:18:24,066
Left on a stoop
in the Village.

240
00:18:24,134 --> 00:18:27,729
I grew up in the East End
Orphanage, mostly in the library.

241
00:18:27,804 --> 00:18:30,102
Hey, there's nothing wrong
with liking to read.

242
00:18:30,173 --> 00:18:32,107
I slept there.

243
00:18:32,175 --> 00:18:34,575
Only place
nobody would bother me.

244
00:18:35,812 --> 00:18:37,780
If I could just be like you.

245
00:18:37,848 --> 00:18:40,578
What, a two-bit detective
who deals in divorce cases?

246
00:18:40,651 --> 00:18:44,348
Don't say that. You're
Nick Allen. You're the best.

247
00:18:44,421 --> 00:18:47,185
That's what I always said.

248
00:18:47,257 --> 00:18:49,191
Oh, boy.

249
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,490
Something wrong?

250
00:18:52,562 --> 00:18:57,761
Sorry, I just never saw
a widow look like you.

251
00:18:57,834 --> 00:19:00,166
Can I help it
if I look good in black?

252
00:19:00,237 --> 00:19:02,262
Besides, I hadn't planned
on dressing tonight.

253
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:05,536
- Nick, we gotta go.
- Go?

254
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:08,442
We got a lead
at the Blue Island.

255
00:19:08,512 --> 00:19:10,446
Nick, you can't go there.
Why not?

256
00:19:10,514 --> 00:19:12,641
God, Nick, that's where Phillip
went the night he was killed.

257
00:19:12,716 --> 00:19:15,651
Why didn't you tell me?

258
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:17,914
You went with him.

259
00:19:19,723 --> 00:19:22,191
Of course I did.

260
00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:24,625
- Nick, what's wrong?
- He's a little shook.

261
00:19:24,695 --> 00:19:26,629
He nearly fell down
the elevator shaft.

262
00:19:26,697 --> 00:19:28,528
- What?
- It was my fault.

263
00:19:28,598 --> 00:19:30,657
It was not your fault.
It was an accident.

264
00:19:30,734 --> 00:19:33,669
Whoever killed Phillip
is after you, isn't he?

265
00:19:33,737 --> 00:19:35,898
- Well...
- Klapper's a pro.

266
00:19:35,972 --> 00:19:40,739
He knows the code, and Nick won't stop tracking
his crushers till they're pushing daisies.

267
00:19:40,811 --> 00:19:43,974
Nick, please don't go
to the Blue Island.

268
00:19:44,047 --> 00:19:48,006
Well, I have to, Allison. You want
me to find Phillip's killer, don't you?

269
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:17,206
<i>I had two theories as to why Allison
insisted on coming to the Blue Island. </i>

270
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,340
<i>One, she had hired Klapper
to kill Phil... </i>

271
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:22,351
<i>and wanted to be sure
that I didn't find him. </i>

272
00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:25,445
<i>Two, she really loved me...
uh, Nick... </i>

273
00:20:25,522 --> 00:20:27,456
<i>and was frightened for his safety. </i>

274
00:20:27,524 --> 00:20:31,290
I really should be frightened,
but I feel so safe in your arms.

275
00:20:31,361 --> 00:20:33,761
<i>Guess which one I believed?</i>

276
00:20:48,311 --> 00:20:50,245
You spotted him?
Who?

277
00:20:50,313 --> 00:20:52,247
Klapper.
No, no.

278
00:20:52,315 --> 00:20:55,842
Just thought I recognized an old
client. You know, messy divorce case.

279
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,446
Thank God I didn't have to
go through that.

280
00:20:59,523 --> 00:21:02,720
Oh, I didn't mean that the
way it sounded, Nick. I swear.

281
00:21:02,793 --> 00:21:04,727
I'm...

282
00:21:14,905 --> 00:21:16,964
You do see him!

283
00:21:25,849 --> 00:21:28,317
Klapper's in the band,
isn't he?

284
00:21:28,385 --> 00:21:31,013
How can I spot someone if I don't
even know what he looks like?

285
00:21:31,087 --> 00:21:34,853
- He may look like a she.
- What?

286
00:21:34,925 --> 00:21:38,588
My buddy just told me the word on the
street is that Klapper's a woman.

287
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,998
I think I'll go get us
some fresh drinks.

288
00:21:43,066 --> 00:21:45,296
- Oh, I'll get 'em, Nick.
- That's all right.

289
00:21:45,368 --> 00:21:48,804
- You stay here and keep Allison company.
- Sure!

290
00:21:51,308 --> 00:21:53,742
You ever read
Tommy Trueblood?

291
00:22:03,253 --> 00:22:05,312
Oh, Sam, wow.

292
00:22:05,388 --> 00:22:08,323
Allison is a killer.

293
00:22:08,391 --> 00:22:11,758
Nick wrote that?
Nick? Oh, the book.

294
00:22:11,828 --> 00:22:15,286
No, no, I'm talking
about her body... deadly.

295
00:22:15,365 --> 00:22:18,493
Oh, Al. She reminds me of
this redhead in billing.

296
00:22:18,568 --> 00:22:21,560
Al, so help me, if you start
with one of your sleazy sex stories,

297
00:22:21,638 --> 00:22:24,072
hologram or no hologram,
I'll slug ya.

298
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,074
- Sleazy?
- Sleazy.

299
00:22:26,142 --> 00:22:29,976
Well, Sam, you know there's
sleaze and there's sleaze, please.

300
00:22:30,046 --> 00:22:32,173
Who killed Phil?
I don't know.

301
00:22:32,249 --> 00:22:34,240
What do you mean?
You got the book. I saw you.

302
00:22:34,317 --> 00:22:36,410
Yeah, but, you know,
it's an unfinished mystery.

303
00:22:36,486 --> 00:22:39,182
It's one of those contest books
they had in the '50s.

304
00:22:39,256 --> 00:22:45,126
You figure out who did the murder and if
the cops can prove it, then you win 10 grand.

305
00:22:45,195 --> 00:22:50,155
Al, it says,
"Who Killed Grimsley and Allen? "

306
00:22:50,233 --> 00:22:54,101
Yeah, I-I thought you'd
notice that last part.

307
00:23:07,117 --> 00:23:09,449
This pin jabber tried to fog him
with a stick of nitro,

308
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:13,421
but Tommy smelled the blow, and creased
the horse rider with an ounce of lead.

309
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,890
Really. That was nothing compared to the time...

310
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:17,893
Tommy ran afoul
on Hound Dog Harry.

311
00:23:17,961 --> 00:23:20,862
He was tracking this dropper who
creased a wheelchair rider from Queens.

312
00:23:20,931 --> 00:23:24,799
Uh-huh.

313
00:23:24,868 --> 00:23:29,066
Two martinis, extra dry and a
Shirley Temple... three dollars.

314
00:23:29,139 --> 00:23:31,664
Three dollars?
What a rip-off.

315
00:23:31,741 --> 00:23:36,440
It's 1953. Any downtown bar would
charge you a buck and a quarter, tops.

316
00:23:36,513 --> 00:23:40,244
- How did I, uh, die?
- Back-stopped an ounce of lead.

317
00:23:40,317 --> 00:23:43,775
- Klapper?
- Probably. But nobody ever collected on it.

318
00:23:43,853 --> 00:23:45,912
Who did the readers suspect?

319
00:23:45,989 --> 00:23:48,651
Everybody, from Joseph Stalin
to Colonel Mustard.

320
00:23:48,725 --> 00:23:53,753
But most of the folks voted for
your paramour, the Red Widow.

321
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,991
- But they didn't prove it.
- Well, they couldn't...

322
00:23:56,066 --> 00:23:59,126
because Allison and Seymour disappeared
on the night of Nick's murder,

323
00:23:59,202 --> 00:24:01,295
which, by the way,
is tonight.

324
00:24:02,706 --> 00:24:04,640
Allison and Seymour?

325
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:08,337
Rumor has it that they
flew off to Rio together.

326
00:24:08,411 --> 00:24:11,444
- Cigars. Cigarettes.
- I can't believe that.

327
00:24:11,445 --> 00:24:12,248
Hi, Nick.

328
00:24:12,249 --> 00:24:14,750
It does kind of stretch
the imagination, doesn't it?

329
00:24:14,818 --> 00:24:20,347
But, you know, some women have
kinky taste in men. Thank you.

330
00:24:20,423 --> 00:24:23,290
Thank God.
Al.

331
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,521
Maybe Klapper killed them
and then hid the bodies.

332
00:24:25,595 --> 00:24:28,962
No, your partner Phil, his
body was found in the office.

333
00:24:29,032 --> 00:24:33,492
And your... uh, Nick's body...
was found at La Guardia.

334
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:36,937
So, if they were left where they were
dropped, why hide Allison and Seymour?

335
00:24:37,007 --> 00:24:39,669
I don't know, Al.
It just seems like...

336
00:24:39,743 --> 00:24:42,712
the most logical explanation.

337
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:46,681
Well, the more logical one
is that Allison is Klapper.

338
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,776
If you wanna have safe sex with her,
you'd better wear a bulletproof vest.

339
00:24:49,853 --> 00:24:53,186
- Al, come on.
- Oh, well, maybe I'm wrong.

340
00:24:53,256 --> 00:24:57,522
But with a body like that, how
could she be interested in Seymour,

341
00:24:57,594 --> 00:24:59,789
no matter
how kinky she is?

342
00:24:59,863 --> 00:25:04,891
She must have used him, and then when she
got tired of him, she blew him away in Rio.

343
00:25:04,968 --> 00:25:09,371
- Allison didn't blow anyone away.
- How do you know?

344
00:25:09,439 --> 00:25:12,203
- How do you know?
- Instinct.

345
00:25:12,275 --> 00:25:16,473
Well, my instinct tells me that that broad
has got you tied in knots this way, that way...

346
00:25:16,546 --> 00:25:19,208
Your instincts got you married
five times, right?

347
00:25:19,282 --> 00:25:22,046
That your Swiss
cheese brain remembers.

348
00:25:22,118 --> 00:25:24,814
Well, I wanna tell you
something, pal.

349
00:25:24,888 --> 00:25:27,254
You haven't been
getting any lately.

350
00:25:27,323 --> 00:25:29,257
Don't compare me to yourself.

351
00:25:29,325 --> 00:25:31,816
I think with my brain, and I don't
cloud my judgment with a bottle.

352
00:25:39,936 --> 00:25:44,600
Well, yeah, well, uh,
Tina's waiting for me.

353
00:25:44,674 --> 00:25:46,835
Uh, got a hot tip
in the eighth.

354
00:25:49,112 --> 00:25:51,342
A "Nostalgia Kills. "

355
00:25:51,414 --> 00:25:56,442
That's a funny name, huh,
for a filly?

356
00:25:56,519 --> 00:25:58,919
You take my advice, pal.

357
00:25:58,988 --> 00:26:03,584
Don't go near La Guardia.
Anyplace but La Guardia.

358
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:12,928
<i>Why do we hurt people
for telling us the truth?</i>

359
00:26:15,605 --> 00:26:17,664
<i>Al was right. </i>

360
00:26:17,741 --> 00:26:20,676
<i>When it came to Allison,
I was as blind as a dead bat... </i>

361
00:26:20,744 --> 00:26:24,111
<i>and tighter than a granny knot
at a Cub Scout picnic. </i>

362
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,944
<i>My God, I'm thinking like Seymour. </i>

363
00:26:38,895 --> 00:26:40,863
This is for you, Bogie.

364
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,005
Everybody must think
Bogie looks like you.

365
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:02,051
I think that's the other way
around, Seymour.

366
00:27:02,118 --> 00:27:04,518
Looks like it's gonna pour.
You wait here.

367
00:27:04,587 --> 00:27:07,112
I'll catch us a cab
on Madison.

368
00:27:14,397 --> 00:27:16,331
What's wrong?

369
00:27:17,801 --> 00:27:20,065
Look, Allison, um...

370
00:27:21,638 --> 00:27:24,539
Did you love Phil?

371
00:27:24,607 --> 00:27:26,541
What kind of a question
is that?

372
00:27:26,609 --> 00:27:28,702
The kind
that has to be asked.

373
00:27:28,778 --> 00:27:33,044
I was 16 when I met Phil.

374
00:27:34,384 --> 00:27:36,818
He was in Pittsburgh
for a divorce case.

375
00:27:38,588 --> 00:27:41,386
I guess you could say
he swept me off my feet.

376
00:27:41,457 --> 00:27:43,425
So you loved him.

377
00:27:43,493 --> 00:27:45,825
I loved the idea
of him.

378
00:27:45,895 --> 00:27:50,127
He was older.
He was from New York.

379
00:27:52,502 --> 00:27:55,903
To the daughter
of a steelworker,

380
00:27:55,972 --> 00:27:58,167
he was very sophisticated.

381
00:27:59,542 --> 00:28:01,567
Guess I was as naive
as Seymour, huh?

382
00:28:04,981 --> 00:28:06,915
No, I didn't love him.

383
00:28:12,488 --> 00:28:15,048
I think the only man
I ever loved is you.

384
00:28:41,417 --> 00:28:43,715
Where's that cab?

385
00:28:49,292 --> 00:28:52,386
I'll go get one.
Hurry.

386
00:28:55,563 --> 00:28:57,091
Nick!

387
00:28:57,166 --> 00:28:59,896
Get back!

388
00:29:06,609 --> 00:29:09,737
Where is he?
In the alley.

389
00:29:14,817 --> 00:29:17,149
He's gone.

390
00:29:19,055 --> 00:29:22,388
You're bleeding.

391
00:29:22,458 --> 00:29:25,086
Just a scratch.

392
00:29:25,161 --> 00:29:27,095
Angel.

393
00:29:38,007 --> 00:29:41,568
Sorry it took so long!

394
00:29:43,379 --> 00:29:45,779
Nick, you're creased.
Somebody shot at us.

395
00:29:45,848 --> 00:29:49,784
- Klapper?
- Gotham Towers.

396
00:29:49,852 --> 00:29:51,843
What took you so long, Seymour?

397
00:29:51,921 --> 00:29:54,617
The canaries were harder to find
than a hooker on Sunday morning.

398
00:29:54,691 --> 00:29:56,625
Plenty of canaries...

399
00:29:56,693 --> 00:29:59,287
- Plenty of cabs from what I could see.
- When I finally got one,

400
00:29:59,362 --> 00:30:02,559
this Hard Harry with a kisser that could
break a mirror in the next apartment...

401
00:30:02,632 --> 00:30:04,657
stepped on my daisy crushers...
Stop it!

402
00:30:04,734 --> 00:30:07,794
No one can be
as nerdy as you're acting.

403
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:09,804
Nerdy?

404
00:30:09,872 --> 00:30:12,966
Wimpy, wussy,
dopey, goofy.

405
00:30:13,042 --> 00:30:15,442
You don't mean that, Nick. Every word of it.

406
00:30:15,511 --> 00:30:17,979
Look, you've been on me,
closer than my underwear,

407
00:30:18,047 --> 00:30:19,981
and it's getting boring.
Take it easy, Nick.

408
00:30:20,049 --> 00:30:23,985
He's gotta find out sometime that he's not gonna
be Sam Spade, Philip Marlowe or Thomas Magnum.

409
00:30:24,053 --> 00:30:26,385
Magnum? I don't wanna be like those guys.

410
00:30:26,456 --> 00:30:28,515
I just wanna be like you. Me?

411
00:30:28,591 --> 00:30:30,889
Kid.

412
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,487
If I'm lucky, I'm gonna spend the rest of my life
leaping around from one place to another...

413
00:30:34,564 --> 00:30:36,964
instead of face down
in a pool of blood.

414
00:30:37,033 --> 00:30:39,729
- Don't do this, Nick!
- It's done.

415
00:30:39,802 --> 00:30:43,294
From now on, you find
some other shamus to pester.

416
00:30:51,581 --> 00:30:54,379
Be right back.

417
00:30:56,085 --> 00:30:59,782
Nick's just tired and hurt.
He didn't mean it, Seymour.

418
00:30:59,856 --> 00:31:02,188
I think he did.

419
00:32:21,104 --> 00:32:23,038
Thank you.

420
00:32:25,842 --> 00:32:29,369
I already hurt one friend tonight.
I can't hurt two.

421
00:32:31,614 --> 00:32:35,550
Look, Seymour, you...

422
00:32:35,618 --> 00:32:39,952
you're not a nerd
or a wuss or a wimp...

423
00:32:40,022 --> 00:32:42,490
or any of the other names
that I called you.

424
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:45,925
You're a neat kid
and a good friend.

425
00:32:45,995 --> 00:32:47,929
Thank you.

426
00:32:47,997 --> 00:32:53,094
The kind a guy can count on,
which is why I said what I did.

427
00:32:53,169 --> 00:32:55,103
I don't get it.

428
00:32:56,172 --> 00:32:58,504
I'm going after
Klapper tonight.

429
00:32:59,609 --> 00:33:02,134
I didn't want you
tagging along.

430
00:33:04,213 --> 00:33:06,147
You were afraid
I'd get hurt.

431
00:33:06,215 --> 00:33:08,149
Or in the way.

432
00:33:08,217 --> 00:33:10,913
Who is he, Nick?
I don't know.

433
00:33:10,987 --> 00:33:13,114
For a while,
I thought it was you.

434
00:33:13,189 --> 00:33:15,123
Me?
Yeah.

435
00:33:15,191 --> 00:33:17,125
You practically shoved me
into the elevator.

436
00:33:17,193 --> 00:33:21,186
And tonight when he tried to fog
me, you were flagging a canary.

437
00:33:21,264 --> 00:33:23,698
It could have been me, but it wasn't. Yeah.

438
00:33:23,766 --> 00:33:26,291
No, I realized that
in the cab.

439
00:33:26,369 --> 00:33:29,236
It was raining when Klapper
shot at me from the alley.

440
00:33:29,305 --> 00:33:31,432
If you were Klapper,
you would have been soaked.

441
00:33:31,507 --> 00:33:33,805
But you don't know who he is. I know where he is.

442
00:33:33,876 --> 00:33:37,039
And we're going after him.
No.

443
00:33:37,113 --> 00:33:39,172
I'm going after him.

444
00:33:39,248 --> 00:33:43,446
I could be an extra pair
of peepers, cover your seat.

445
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:48,479
Nick, after what you said,
you owe it to me.

446
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:52,725
Okay, kid,

447
00:33:52,795 --> 00:33:55,559
on two conditions.
Name 'em.

448
00:33:55,631 --> 00:33:57,826
One: You follow my orders
to the letter.

449
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,834
And?

450
00:33:59,902 --> 00:34:01,927
Go get a raincoat
so you don't catch pneumonia.

451
00:34:02,004 --> 00:34:04,268
Gotcha!

452
00:34:08,277 --> 00:34:10,302
So long, Seymour.

453
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,687
I thought you'd never get here.

454
00:34:43,145 --> 00:34:45,807
Just missed the cab, huh?

455
00:34:52,355 --> 00:34:56,223
I got it. You laid a Ben Franklin on
the cocktail shaker at the Blue Island,

456
00:34:56,292 --> 00:35:00,228
and he opened up like a pencil pusher
from Toledo on his third martini.

457
00:35:00,296 --> 00:35:03,322
I gave the bartender
at the club $100,

458
00:35:03,399 --> 00:35:06,800
and he started talking like an accountant
from Toledo who'd had one too many?

459
00:35:06,869 --> 00:35:09,360
- That's what I said.
- Oh, God, I understood you.

460
00:35:09,438 --> 00:35:11,838
- Am I right?
- No.

461
00:35:11,907 --> 00:35:14,705
Then how do you know Klapper's
taking Allison to La Guardia?

462
00:35:14,777 --> 00:35:17,575
- And not vice versa.
- Al.

463
00:35:17,647 --> 00:35:19,842
Al? Who's Al?

464
00:35:19,915 --> 00:35:22,611
A... A friend.
A real good friend.

465
00:35:22,685 --> 00:35:24,812
Well, let's not get mushy
about it.

466
00:35:24,887 --> 00:35:26,946
The one who tipped you
to the Klapper.

467
00:35:27,023 --> 00:35:29,287
Well, he tipped me about a lot
of things, and I wouldn't listen.

468
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:32,589
Well, maybe I went
a little too far.

469
00:35:32,662 --> 00:35:36,257
I got angry and I said some
things that I regret.

470
00:35:36,332 --> 00:35:39,529
He's the other friend
you hurt tonight?

471
00:35:39,602 --> 00:35:41,695
What, you jumped
on the kid too?

472
00:35:42,905 --> 00:35:45,465
- I'm afraid so.
- Aw, Sam.

473
00:35:45,541 --> 00:35:48,009
I'll bet you didn't want
him to get hurt either.

474
00:35:48,077 --> 00:35:50,602
Hurt?

475
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,478
Where are we going, Sam?

476
00:35:53,549 --> 00:35:56,450
- La Guardia.
- Yeah.

477
00:36:11,133 --> 00:36:15,627
Sam, uh, this is
very dangerous.

478
00:36:18,107 --> 00:36:22,043
- Allison's in there somewhere.
- That's why it's dangerous.

479
00:36:25,715 --> 00:36:27,808
It's a big bird roost, Nick.

480
00:36:27,883 --> 00:36:32,547
Yeah. All right, you take that end, I'll take
this one, and I'll meet you in the middle.

481
00:36:32,621 --> 00:36:35,590
- Gotcha!
- Seymour.

482
00:36:35,658 --> 00:36:41,324
Allison may have hired
Klapper to kill Phil.

483
00:36:41,397 --> 00:36:44,525
- Thanks.
- Nick, you can't think that.

484
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,899
- Well, no, but,
- Oh, Sam.

485
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:50,200
As long as
there's a possibility,

486
00:36:50,272 --> 00:36:52,866
if you eyeball
my main squeeze,

487
00:36:52,942 --> 00:36:56,002
Peeping Tom her
until you can semaphore me.

488
00:36:56,078 --> 00:36:59,445
"Main squeeze"?

489
00:36:59,515 --> 00:37:02,109
Allison.

490
00:37:02,184 --> 00:37:05,915
"Main squeeze. "
I gotta remember that one.

491
00:37:12,762 --> 00:37:17,062
What's wrong, Al? I thought you
were up on all this private eye lingo.

492
00:37:17,133 --> 00:37:20,864
I understood you.
I'm just wondering how in 20 years...

493
00:37:20,936 --> 00:37:25,339
"main squeeze" gets from
Seymour to black slang.

494
00:37:27,176 --> 00:37:30,111
I assume you're packing a roscoe.

495
00:37:30,179 --> 00:37:32,306
Yep.

496
00:37:32,381 --> 00:37:36,374
Would you use it on Allison
if you had to?

497
00:37:36,452 --> 00:37:38,647
Probably not.

498
00:37:38,721 --> 00:37:41,315
Great.

499
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:44,882
Where you going? I’m going
to check the ladies' room.

500
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,861
- Al!
- Somebody's gotta do it.

501
00:37:56,038 --> 00:37:58,768
Bogie! Don't point, Allen. It's not polite.

502
00:37:58,841 --> 00:38:01,969
But it's Humphrey Bogart.
Mr. Bogart. Mr. Bogart!

503
00:38:02,044 --> 00:38:04,877
- This can't be.
- Oh, it is you. I knew it!

504
00:38:04,947 --> 00:38:08,246
- Allen, leave the poor man alone.
- I've seen all your movies.

505
00:38:08,317 --> 00:38:12,777
Ever since I could curl my lip, I wanted
to be like you. I even dream you talk to me.

506
00:38:12,855 --> 00:38:15,756
You know, give me advice, like
how to get Annie up to my bedroom.

507
00:38:17,193 --> 00:38:20,185
Lionel, gee,
what are you doing here?

508
00:38:22,698 --> 00:38:24,632
Move.

509
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:28,033
My analyst calls it neurotic.
Of course it's neurotic.

510
00:38:28,103 --> 00:38:30,196
If he lived with my mother,
he'd be neurotic too.

511
00:38:30,272 --> 00:38:33,105
She drives me bananas.

512
00:38:33,175 --> 00:38:35,109
Excuse me.

513
00:38:39,448 --> 00:38:41,382
- See what you did?
- I just wanted his autograph.

514
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:43,850
You want an autograph?
Here's an autograph.

515
00:39:30,366 --> 00:39:32,493
Lionel, let him go.

516
00:39:34,637 --> 00:39:37,162
We don't wanna
hurt him, Nick.

517
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:40,504
All Allison and I want
is out of New York.

518
00:39:40,576 --> 00:39:44,672
Nick won't let... Nick, you have to face reality.

519
00:39:44,747 --> 00:39:48,205
She doesn't love you
any more than she loved Phil.

520
00:39:48,284 --> 00:39:51,651
- Is that why you killed him?
- He wouldn't face the truth.

521
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:55,451
We had no choice.
But you're smarter, Nick.

522
00:39:55,524 --> 00:39:57,549
Always were!

523
00:39:57,626 --> 00:40:00,356
Where's Allison?

524
00:40:00,429 --> 00:40:03,489
Seymour's dying, Nick!

525
00:40:03,566 --> 00:40:05,693
What's it gonna be?

526
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:25,381
How many shots was that now
that he fired so far?

527
00:40:25,454 --> 00:40:27,479
- Get down, Al!
- Why?

528
00:40:27,556 --> 00:40:30,047
He can't see me
or hear me.

529
00:40:30,125 --> 00:40:33,754
You stay down.
I'll go find him for you.

530
00:40:33,829 --> 00:40:36,423
Al.

531
00:40:39,602 --> 00:40:41,968
There you are,
you sneaky devil.

532
00:40:44,306 --> 00:40:46,240
He's right over here, Sam.

533
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:53,170
You couldn't hit an elephant
in a tunnel.

534
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,239
Boy, are you in
for a big surprise.

535
00:40:55,317 --> 00:40:57,285
Sam, he doesn't know
where you are.

536
00:40:57,353 --> 00:40:59,446
He's gonna shoot,
now duck!

537
00:41:00,856 --> 00:41:06,658
Sam, go to the back of the hangar,
and then make your way toward me.

538
00:41:06,729 --> 00:41:10,165
Don't you ever clean your mustache?
You got gunk in there. It's yucky.

539
00:41:10,232 --> 00:41:12,291
Gonna shoot again!

540
00:41:12,368 --> 00:41:15,166
Ah! Now, Sam!

541
00:41:15,237 --> 00:41:19,697
He's out of bullets. He's loading
up. Get over here. Hurry Up!

542
00:41:19,775 --> 00:41:23,040
Sam, hurry! Where the hell are you, Sam?

543
00:41:26,615 --> 00:41:29,482
Don't even think about it,
you mug.

544
00:41:29,551 --> 00:41:33,510
Oh, no, Sam. Sam,
that's Edward G. Robinson.

545
00:41:52,274 --> 00:41:55,471
How could I have turned Lionel on
and not realized it?

546
00:41:58,414 --> 00:42:02,180
You know, the funny part is
I kind of feel sorry for him.

547
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,253
Yeah, me too.

548
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:10,156
Nick, take me away from this.

549
00:42:12,361 --> 00:42:15,489
My apartment?

550
00:42:15,564 --> 00:42:20,160
Actually, I was thinking
of someplace a little farther.

551
00:42:27,476 --> 00:42:29,740
Where'd you get those?

552
00:42:29,812 --> 00:42:34,215
Well, I know some people
might think it's a little bizarre,

553
00:42:34,283 --> 00:42:36,911
but the poor soul
did pay for them.

554
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,054
Where are they to?

555
00:42:41,557 --> 00:42:43,582
Does it matter?

556
00:43:14,757 --> 00:43:18,523
You, uh,
you wanna board, Angel?

557
00:43:18,594 --> 00:43:21,119
I'll join you in a minute.

558
00:43:23,732 --> 00:43:26,565
Don't make me wait too long.

559
00:43:27,636 --> 00:43:29,763
It's a sleeper flight.

560
00:43:43,986 --> 00:43:47,717
I don't think
you can take that plane.

561
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:51,658
Oh, Al.
I'm gonna get on that plane,

562
00:43:51,727 --> 00:43:54,059
'cause if I don't, I'm gonna
regret it for the rest of my life.

563
00:43:54,129 --> 00:43:56,063
Maybe not today,
maybe not tomorrow, but...

564
00:43:56,131 --> 00:43:59,430
No, no, I've seen
the picture, Sam.

565
00:43:59,501 --> 00:44:03,437
Oh, well, good.
Then you know how it ends.

566
00:44:26,028 --> 00:44:28,997
- Sam.
- What?

567
00:44:29,064 --> 00:44:33,296
I didn't say you didn't want to go with her.
I said I didn't think you could.

568
00:44:33,368 --> 00:44:36,064
- Who's gonna stop me?
- Nick!

569
00:44:37,139 --> 00:44:40,939
He tried to kill me,
to choke me to death.

570
00:44:41,009 --> 00:44:44,809
Don't you mean the loony tune tried
to fog me with a chicken throttle?

571
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,075
Nick, this was for real.

572
00:44:47,149 --> 00:44:49,811
Isn't that what
you're looking for, Seymour?

573
00:44:49,885 --> 00:44:52,445
A chance to duke it out
with the Hard Harry’s...

574
00:44:52,521 --> 00:44:56,423
on a night as quiet as the
city morgue on a slow day.

575
00:44:56,491 --> 00:44:59,392
Maybe it would be more fun
to just read about it.

576
00:44:59,461 --> 00:45:03,397
Yeah, or write about it.

577
00:45:03,465 --> 00:45:07,026
Me?
Become a writer?

578
00:45:07,102 --> 00:45:09,468
Yeah, why not?
With your imagination...

579
00:45:09,538 --> 00:45:13,804
and flair for similes,
how could you miss?

580
00:45:13,876 --> 00:45:16,743
Nick?

581
00:45:16,812 --> 00:45:19,246
Hurry.

582
00:45:19,314 --> 00:45:21,248
Oh, boy.

583
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:28,587
The fog was as thick
as hash house oatmeal...

584
00:45:28,657 --> 00:45:32,753
and twice as cold,
as her hips said good-bye.

585
00:45:32,828 --> 00:45:35,922
Maybe she was too much
moonlight and orchids for me,

586
00:45:35,998 --> 00:45:39,661
but I couldn't help wishing
that my daisy crunchers and hers...

587
00:45:39,735 --> 00:45:42,465
could be outside
the same hotel room door.

588
00:45:42,537 --> 00:45:46,064
You were here to launch
a new pulp novelist.

589
00:45:46,141 --> 00:45:49,042
No. No, no, no.

590
00:45:49,111 --> 00:45:51,841
Sam, I think...
Don't say it, Al.

591
00:45:51,914 --> 00:45:55,247
This is the start
of a wonderful friendship.

592
00:45:55,317 --> 00:45:57,251
You couldn't resist,
could you?

593
00:46:12,234 --> 00:46:15,169
You'd better hurry.
You'll be late for your new job,

594
00:46:15,237 --> 00:46:18,729
Miss Youngest Executive Secretary
at the company.

595
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:24,303
"Miss"?
