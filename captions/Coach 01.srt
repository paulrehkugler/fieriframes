1
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,670
It's the middle of
the night there, right?

2
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:34,990
Is this an emergency?

3
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,870
Please face
toward your right.

4
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,270
Fifty tons of Iowa beef.

5
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:42,980
What about the quality?

6
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,020
How much per kilo?

7
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,370
Please hold your breath.

8
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:51,540
It sounds like a great offer.

9
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,750
Don't inform the company
yet. I'll call you back.

10
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,390
If you sleep, I'll fire you!

11
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,320
Yamamoto? It's unusual for
you to be at the office

12
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,390
so early in the morning.

13
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:06,460
So you can
be useful.

14
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,930
Mr. Minamoto from
Chicago just called me

15
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,000
There's a surplus of beef
that was supposed

16
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,530
to be shipped to Canada.

17
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,230
Right. It's 2,000 yen
per kilo. We'll buy it.

18
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,800
I want you to inform
Mr. Shimizu immediately.

19
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,020
It'll all depend on his
client Kanto Foods.

20
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:22,100
Ouch!

21
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,670
When Minamoto's fax
regarding the

22
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,580
beef's quality is received
tell Mr. Shimizu to take it.

23
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,090
I'll talk to the president
of Kanto Foods.

24
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,140
What? The physical...?
I'm undergoing it right now!

25
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,590
lt's a waste of time, though.

26
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,140
Please go to your
next examination.

27
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,890
Make reservations for a
cargo shipment tonight,

28
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,100
Chicago to Narita.

29
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,110
I want you to negotiate a
favorable freight charge.

30
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,830
This is Kubota
President, how are things?

31
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:52,380
Forty-five! My, my...

32
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:57,170
By the way, your supermarket
is running a food fair, right?

33
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,740
We were able to obtain 50 tons of Iowa beef.

34
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,110
Yes, it's 2100 yen per kilo.

35
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,680
I will guarantee the quality.

36
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,370
No, nothing in particular.

37
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,230
Is it a deal?

38
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,700
Thank you very much.

39
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,570
What a fast decision.
That's very promising.

40
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:25,210
Yes, definitely next week.
Goodbye.

41
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:33,020
Yamamoto?
The deal is sealed.

42
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,010
There are actually fools who
purchase merchandise sight unseen.

43
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,980
It's a rush.
Wait a minute!

44
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,850
Don't tell the manager yet,
I'll tell him personally.

45
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,610
I closed the deal...
All by myself.

46
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,870
Any complaints? Goodbye.

47
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,860
Please stop your calls.
It's prohibited.

48
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,230
I'm done.

49
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,500
We're not done yet.

50
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,620
You're wasting your time.
There's nothing wrong.

51
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,860
There's a fatty substance
on your liver.

52
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,850
You should change 
your diet.

53
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,500
Reduce your meats and
eat more fish products.

54
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,850
I hate fish. I had food
poisoning from mackerel.

55
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,760
Furthermore,
your stress level...

56
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,200
What is stress?

57
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,630
Don't you have
any complaints?

58
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,050
My personal life is fine,
and my work is perfect.

59
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,330
I have no complaints.

60
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,970
Hello, this is Kubota...

61
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,540
Is it going to be the
President's Award again?

62
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,850
What is?

63
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,400
I understand you sealed a
100 million yen deal,

64
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,810
while undergoing
a physical.

65
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,890
You heard already?

66
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,420
It only took a few seconds
to reach the 11th floor.

67
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,110
Rumors have no legs.

68
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,170
I hope the news reached
the president.

69
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,120
I'm envious.
You're doing well.

70
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,160
Nothing's qood about it!

71
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,890
We're doing poorly, so
I have to work extra hard.

72
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,310
Our company services
international telephone circuits.

73
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,690
No matter how
hard I work,

74
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,200
there're  so many
complicated obstacles

75
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,400
like regulations
and authorizations.

76
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,070
Griping is recognized as 
lack of competency.

77
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:43,110
I'm not griping,
I'm bragging.

78
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,280
We're on the verge of
winning over the head of

79
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,620
the Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications

80
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:48,960
Within this month, we'll get
the authorization,

81
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,030
thanks to my
great performance.

82
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,500
Oolala! Bravo!

83
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:55,320
Once we get the authorization,
we're going to mass market

84
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,090
to all the companies.
We have to repay our debt

85
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,830
to the government agency.

86
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,930
Be careful of wiretap 
microphones.

87
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,520
They are in the ceiling.

88
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,640
Please be good to
Iwasa of the

89
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,390
Telecommunications Department.

90
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,070
What about tonight...?

91
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,210
I won't be too late.

92
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,010
I'll be waiting at
the apartment.

93
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,010
Sixth Floor...

94
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,750
I'll be waiting while I drink.

95
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,020
Don't fall asleep.
We have something to do.

96
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,040
Welcome back.

97
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,890
How was the physical?

98
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,240
Don't talk to me about
anything else but work.

99
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:39,730
I'm sorry.

100
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:43,570
What about our contract
with Kanto Foods?

101
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,920
It's a done deal
The client was elated.

102
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,490
I want you to arrange
for a dinner meeting.

103
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,840
How is your schedule?

104
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,740
I can't attend everything.
Use your discretion.

105
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,200
It doesn't have to be
too expensive.

106
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,450
This is the consignment schedule
and freight budget.

107
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,150
I've already discussed this with
 Mr. Minamata in Chicago.

108
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,780
Don't discuss things
without me.

109
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:01,040
I'll keep an eye out
for the merchandise.

110
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,750
Please take care of it
with Mr. Yamamoto.

111
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,490
I understand.

112
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,250
Don't you dare
make a mistake.

113
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,440
It's a deal that I closed.

114
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,990
You had 5 phone calls.

115
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,800
Get me a cup of coffee.
Right away.

116
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,570
Where's the material
for the meeting?

117
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,460
What about the point at
issue from the last meeting?

118
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,190
Is it easier
to understand?

119
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,430
It's been reduced
to one page.

120
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:24,960
This should've been done
from the beginning.

121
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,970
I hope today's
presentation goes well.

122
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,470
You're too naive.

123
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,290
That's why you can't
make promising deals.

124
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:41,400
It's not "I hope it goes well".
I know it will.

125
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:46,000
Section Chief Kubota will,
make another proposal.

126
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:51,680
As I've explained over and
over, this is a new market

127
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,140
development plan
for imported beef.

128
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,410
In other words,
we don't buy beef

129
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:59,130
from ranches overseas.
We'll build our own

130
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,380
ranch overseas and
become self-producing.

131
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,190
If you look at the
materials provided

132
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,950
based on the development
of this strategy

133
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,990
you'll understand that
imported beef

134
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,020
will become even more
economical to purchase.

135
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,980
The prospective ranch to be
purchased is 20,000 acres,

136
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,760
located in the suburb
of Australia's Gold Coast.

137
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:24,000
If successful, 100 tons
of beef will be exclusively

138
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,220
secured every week.

139
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:29,740
There's an image that
imported beef is not good.

140
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,950
Will that affect sales?

141
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,250
That was 10 years ago.

142
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,520
Current consumers
aren't concerned with

143
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,560
domestic or imported,
as long as they can eat

144
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:41,420
an abundance of
cheap meat.

145
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,460
Breeding will be 100
percent, Japanese style.

146
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,030
We'll guarantee the taste.

147
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,480
This way, Sir.

148
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:07,650
Thank you.

149
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:16,360
I'm Hirabayashi.

150
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,640
I'm Nagamine, Manager of
the Food Department.

151
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,530
I'm Kubota of
the 3rd Section.

152
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,370
I'm in charge of
beef importation.

153
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:32,690
A female section chief?
That's very promising.

154
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:38,570
I didn't call you here for
entertainment purposes.

155
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,790
This is a study session.

156
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,000
I understand thoroughly.

157
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,910
Please have a drink.

158
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,320
No, thank you.

159
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:59,830
We have a beautiful
snapper tonight.

160
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,790
We'll have that.
Is that all right?

161
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:08,460
I'm sorry. I don't eat fish.

162
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:09,860
You hate it?

163
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:11,960
I've had food poisoning
from mackerel.

164
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,240
This is a special occasion.

165
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,150
I can't eat it.

166
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,200
Please prepare meat
for this young lady.

167
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:24,760
Thank you.
We'll serve ourselves.

168
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,070
I don't have time,
so I'll get to the point.

169
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,600
A friend of mine from
the Ministry of

170
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:49,710
Agriculture and Forestry
informed me...

171
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,440
You intend to buy out
a ranch in Australia.

172
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,580
Yes. Well...we're still
formulating the plan.

173
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,700
Is it a consideration?

174
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,130
Yes, it is.

175
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,280
It's my idea.

176
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:11,050
Terminate it. I promise to
return the favor next time.

177
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,200
Okay. Everything's set.

178
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:19,710
Please listen
to our proposal.

179
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,820
Stop it. Let's drink
until dinner.

180
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,920
I'd like an explanation...

181
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:29,840
Don't misunderstand.
I'm not commanding you.

182
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:37,040
Please understand...I just
asked you to terminate it...

183
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,450
That's all I have to say.

184
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,410
I don't understand.

185
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,080
Ms. Kubota..!

186
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,830
We haven't violated the
law and there aren't

187
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,030
any regulations.
We're appeasing the needs

188
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,810
of the consumers by
providing them with

189
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:54,430
cheap, abundant, imported
beef at a very low cost...

190
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:05,170
Yes...Mr. Hirabayashi is
currently in a meeting...

191
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:18,930
Let me be frank then.
The ranch in my hometown

192
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:25,490
is worried. The cheap beef
which you import,

193
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,960
has created a low demand
for domestic beef.

194
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:34,240
Please don'tl torment them.
I pity the people

195
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,880
of my hometown.
That's the way it is.

196
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,400
I understand
We will re-evaluate...

197
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,330
Pity is illogical. I want
hard data that proves

198
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,940
their financial distress.

199
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:48,490
Politics cannot
be run by logic.

200
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:53,620
Our job is to save
pitiful people.

201
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,460
Our work has
no compassion.

202
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,080
Compassion is the
protest of weak people.

203
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,440
We don't have to
tend to them.

204
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,480
That's enough, Ms. Kubota.

205
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,500
I don't mind. However,
you can't ignore your fellow

206
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:19,130
Japanese citizen,
who is suffering.

207
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:22,160
Domestic tunnel vision is
adequate for you, but

208
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:25,350
we look at Japanese
economy on an

209
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,420
international level.
Historically speaking,

210
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,230
there are times when
the needs of the mass

211
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,380
outweigh the
needs of the few...

212
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,020
Will you please turn that off!

213
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:40,600
Mr. Hirabayashi has an
emergency phone call.

214
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,640
This is important
to me too!

215
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:49,170
It's irritating.
Please turn it off.

216
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,050
I'll call you back.

217
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,150
Ms Kubota, right?

218
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:59,270
Do you hate telephones?

219
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:08,040
You hate telephones. I see.

220
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,930
What were your intentions?

221
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:28,030
It would have been favorable
for him to be happy.

222
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,440
I was in a cold sweat.

223
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:32,560
He agreed,
after we explained.

224
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,050
You're too simple-minded.

225
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,090
Politicians live
purely on honor.

226
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:39,020
It's because of politicians
like him that prevent

227
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,000
the consumers from
purchasing cheap,

228
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,910
fine quality items.

229
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,920
That's not the point.

230
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:48,390
You couldn't say it,
so I said it for you.

231
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,610
Stop acting so tough!

232
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,890
Good work.
Good work.

233
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:24,450
Baseball results
won't help your job.

234
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,170
Change the channel!

235
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:31,040
What's amusing about
an adult swinging a bat?

236
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,430
Aren't you interested
in the sudden drop

237
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,260
of the New York
Stock Exchange?

238
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,340
What's bothering you?

239
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:49,850
I'm excited. My great success
will be exhibited tomorrow.

240
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,870
Your protect's 
materializing already?

241
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:54,590
Cheers!

242
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:55,440
No way.

243
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,630
I'm not so naive
as to celebrate

244
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:58,820
someone else's victory.

245
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:07,790
I cornered a politician.
He'll soon admit that I was right

246
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:11,080
and there was no
reason to refute.

247
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,730
I'm taking a shower.
Open a bottle of wine.

248
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:20,090
I don't have much time.
I'm going to work, first thing.

249
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:24,770
Do you understand?
If you pause, you lose.

250
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,980
What is it?

251
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,610
You're right.
There's no reason to refute.

252
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,640
I'm exhausted.

253
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,530
Griping is considered as
a lack of competency.

254
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,610
I don't care,
if it's in front of you

255
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,620
You never know when
I'll be your enemy.

256
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,140
Good morning!

257
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:18,890
Good morning!

258
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,750
Mr. Iwasa!
Something terrible...!

259
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,850
Good morning!

260
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,370
The project is being
materialized!

261
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,590
Don't be a fool.
Nothing's been decided upon.

262
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,550
The emergency meeting
started at 8 am.

263
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,250
Really?

264
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,780
They're voting
on your project.

265
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,070
This early in the morning?

266
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,770
The Manager's in the
Director's office too.

267
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,650
It's definite.

268
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,600
Even that slowpoke
is in early.

269
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,310
What in the world
did you do?

270
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,780
What is it? Explain!

271
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,500
Our international telephone circuit project was called off!

272
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:20,300
What?

273
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,210
We got a call from the Ministry of Posts
and Telecommunications this morning!

274
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,790
We'll have to start all over
again for the authorization!

275
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,850
What does that
have to do with me?

276
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,480
Your manager was called into
an emergency directors' meeting.

277
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,950
You met with Hirabayashi Junzaburo

278
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,800
yesterday, right?

279
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,720
So what about it!

280
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,260
That's the problem!

281
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,440
What's going on?

282
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,480
It's turned into an
extremely messy situation.

283
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,310
Tell me.

284
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,570
Hirabayashi Junzaburo
got angry at your attitude.

285
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,580
And...?

286
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,500
You owe me one.

287
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,500
I understand.
Tell me.

288
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,470
Hirabayashi is an
agricultural representative

289
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,620
but until the last election,
he was a member

290
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,750
of the Telecommunications
Review  Board.

291
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,010
He has power with the
Ministry of Posts and

292
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,850
Telecommunications.
He placed a lot of pressure

293
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,160
in retaliation against you.

294
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,190
It doesn't concern the
Telecommunications Department.

295
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:03,020
It's the same company
He retaliated.

296
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,630
We have a 2 billion yen
debt for this project.

297
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,020
if we don't get the
authorization,

298
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,070
it's the end.

299
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:11,890
It wasn't smart to
anger Hirabayashi.

300
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,480
Mr. Hirabayashi is in a
meeting. Please leave

301
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,630
I apologize for my
subordinate's rudeness.

302
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:29,130
I don't know how
to apologize.

303
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:35,780
Please forgive us.

304
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,630
This is our company's
proposal, in formal apology.

305
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:53,300
First, we will double last
year's political contribution

306
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:58,560
to your party. Second,
our company will sponsor

307
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:04,670
your financial seminars
5 time in the next year.

308
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:10,780
Women are no good.
They're emotional animals.

309
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:17,200
I'll allow the authorization of
your international telephone

310
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:20,370
circuit. I intend to
keep my relationship

311
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,410
with your company.

312
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:32,040
I will severely
caution my subordinate.

313
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:38,070
If my daughter spoke to
an older man like that

314
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:43,070
I would spank her in the
rear and kick her out.

315
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:51,850
That's what l would do.
That's the end.

316
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:56,080
Please move forward with the
international telephone

317
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,990
circuit project.

318
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,840
Thank you very much.

319
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:09,040
Mr. Nagamine...
Regarding Ms. Kubota...

320
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:17,600
Is this all right?

321
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,350
I believe that's appropriate.

322
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:20,510
Do you agree?

323
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,550
If the Director agrees...

324
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,710
Let's go with this.

325
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,040
In this regarding
Section Chief Kubota

326
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,090
of the Foods Division?

327
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,660
We've decided to
terminate her.

328
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:39,500
Are you dissatisfied with
a sacrifice for your sake?

329
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,710
It can't be helped.

330
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,880
Please pardon my intrusion.

331
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,870
We'll leave.

332
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,100
Sit down.

333
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,410
Is this regarding
yesterday's incident?

334
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:25,450
I represented the
company and apologized.

335
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:28,160
Won't you listen to me?

336
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,840
You'll be removed
from your position,

337
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:32,080
for a period of time.

338
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,420
Please wait...

339
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:38,290
I the recognize the
fault on my part...

340
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,340
It's for one month.

341
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:43,490
When things settle down,
you can return.

342
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,950
But Manager...!
My department needs me...!

343
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:49,420
Don't worry.
I'll find a replacement.

344
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,350
I will apologize to
Mr. Hirabayashi.

345
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:52,950
Please allow me
to apologize!

346
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:53,830
There's no need.

347
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:58,180
The decision is made.

348
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:18,340
Thank you.
You may leave.

349
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,810
Director...

350
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:30,090
Please listen,
one more time.

351
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,500
I cannot leave
my department

352
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,570
for one month.
I have many projects

353
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,980
that are in
process right now.

354
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:41,680
Please look at this!

355
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,980
I promise to
make it a success.

356
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:50,670
Please look at this, too.

357
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,120
This is how much
I've improved on the

358
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,570
company's profits since
my employment.

359
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:58,450
A lot of projects
have been successful and...

360
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:01,670
It's all written here...!
My performance had climbed

361
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,530
higher than any other manager
 of the same rank.

362
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:06,670
The food department
needs me!

363
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:09,070
I've already devised a
reform plan for the

364
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:11,130
organization, when I
become manager!

365
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,380
I want to centralize
all 4 departments...!

366
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:15,550
Open your eyes!

367
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,420
The first few hours this
morning were critical

368
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:24,490
to the existence
of the company!

369
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,860
Even my position!

370
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,860
I am the interim section
chief for the Third Section,

371
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:01,030
I will be taking over all
the current work-in-process

372
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,580
projects and any other
current matters.

373
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,990
When I return, I'll worki
ten times harder.

374
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,650
I'm not throwing away my
life because of this.

375
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:18,710
If you pause you lose.

376
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:24,020
That's right.
That's what I've decided.

377
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:29,640
My work is my life.

378
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,850
Is it a transfer?

379
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:42,500
It's our affiliate
food product factory.

380
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,780
The head of the factory
retired and we have

381
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:51,440
an opening. You'll work
there for one month.

382
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:55,870
Where is that
factory located?

383
00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:00,000
We'll momentarily
be arriving at

384
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:03,940
Kujukunhama Kominato.

385
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,450
I'm looking for a factory.

386
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:00,780
Factory?

387
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,430
It's here somewhere.

388
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:10,130
They went bankrupt
a long time ago.

389
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:12,140
That's impossible.

390
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,520
It used to be down
that small lane.

391
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,610
You're wasting
your time.

392
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,850
I'm not buying
any insurance.

393
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,000
My name is Kubota Nagisa

394
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:15,070
Leave your pamphlet
and I'll look at it later.

395
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:21,740
Ms. Kubota...? Are you
from Godai Bussan?

396
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:23,190
Yes.

397
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,050
She's our new
factory chief.

398
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:41,020
Over there...

399
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,090
Do I look like an
insurance salesperson?

400
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,130
Only insurance sales people
are dressed like you

401
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:59,030
in the countryside.

402
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,960
I'll take note of that.

403
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,700
Where are the
other employees?

404
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:14,780
They're around...

405
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:19,450
Somewhere...

406
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:31,020
She's our new factory chief.

407
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,830
You're an employee?

408
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,350
I guess.

409
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,770
She's the assistant chief,
Mochizuki Shijimi.

410
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:43,410
Apparently, that's what I am.
I'm not thrilled.

411
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:45,940
I just do miscellaneous chores.

412
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,540
You were goofing off
during working hours?

413
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,500
The weather was nice.

414
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,610
It's a wonderful feeling,
reading on the seashore.

415
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,640
Aren't you supposed
to be working!

416
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,920
Am I being reprimanded?

417
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,880
The binding machine
is causing problems.

418
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:09,960
Don't tell us every little
problem! Nobu's there!

419
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,630
He won't wake up!

420
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,000
He was out playing
all night in Tokyo.

421
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,890
Kick it. Kick it,
and it'll work.

422
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,430
I'll try it.

423
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:26,890
Please take our factory chief
on a a tour of the factory...

424
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:27,890
Yes, I will.

425
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,190
What are you producing?

426
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,450
Canned mackerel.

427
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,000
Mackerel?

428
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,750
It's a fish.

429
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,910
I know that!

430
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,030
Why don't you go ahead?

431
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,800
Who do you think
you're speaking to?

432
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:50,190
Watch your behavior.

433
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:54,720
We're already her servants.

434
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,700
I'm pleased to meet you.
My name is Ishii Takeshi.

435
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,510
Is he an employee too?

436
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,120
Yes.

437
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:16,880
You're all very unique.

438
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,690
Yes. They're all good people.

439
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,090
I'm being sarcastic.

440
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,390
Please go in.

441
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:36,680
Please come this way.

442
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,770
This is the canning process.

443
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,500
I'll start from
the beginning.

444
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:58,370
I will explain the
work process.

445
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:02,830
First, they cut up
the mackerel.

446
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:40,900
Are you all right?

447
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,610
Fish...

448
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:47,420
I hate them.

449
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,710
Are you all right?

450
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,800
Don't shake me!

451
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,630
What's the matter?

452
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,020
The new factory chief...

453
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,130
Is she here?

454
00:37:57,930 --> 00:37:59,400
Why are you hugging her?

455
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,640
You're mistaken!

456
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,060
She got ill.

457
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:07,180
Really? Are you all right?

458
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:08,160
Are you all right?

459
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,210
You hate fish.

460
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,210
You came to a
a terrible place.

461
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,790
We only deal with fish here.

462
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:44,010
If you take fish out of
this town, there's nothing.

463
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:47,130
What shall we do?

464
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,030
Don't get friendly with me.

465
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:51,920
Gather all the employees.

466
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:55,010
This is your podium.
Please use it.

467
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,430
I'm a transferee from
the main office.

468
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:03,980
My name is Kubota Nagisa.

469
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,920
It'll only be for one month,
but it's been determined

470
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:10,060
that I'll be working here.

471
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,460
You all seem to be relaxed
and laid back, but...

472
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:19,030
People with that attitude
will be fired in 2 minutes.

473
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,990
Remember that.

474
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:25,090
Henceforth, at this factory...

475
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:37,410
Wait one moment!
I haven't finished!

476
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,400
Get back here!

477
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,710
We have work to do.

478
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:47,490
It's an important matter.

479
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,500
Let's put some spirit into it!

480
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:04,060
The game is just
around the corner!

481
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,020
Let's get a win!

482
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,980
Is this the important matter?

483
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:01,330
Would you like to play, too?
