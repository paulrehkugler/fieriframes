Hi, Larry.
Oh, hi, Susan.

20
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:42,336
The mailman put this
in my box by mistake.

21
00:01:42,403 --> 00:01:44,405
Another letter from Ed McMahon.

22
00:01:44,472 --> 00:01:46,874
I feel bad about
not getting back to him.

23
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,245
Susan.
Hi, Balki.

24
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,417
Let me bathe
in your beauty.

25
00:01:56,484 --> 00:02:00,254
All right, up.
Bath time is over.

26
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:04,192
You'll have
to forgive Balki.

27
00:02:05,593 --> 00:02:09,597
Susan, let me shine
your shoes with my heart.

28
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:14,235
He is so cute.

29
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:16,604
Balki, save something
for your honeymoon.

30
00:02:19,307 --> 00:02:20,874
See ya.
Bye-bye, Susan.

31
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:22,610
Goodbye, love goddess.

32
00:02:26,214 --> 00:02:27,981
You don't do that
to other women.

33
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:30,318
I don't know any other women.

34
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:32,220
Well, maybe you should
go out and meet some.

35
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:35,323
Easy for you,
you're a happening guy.

36
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:39,493
Well, true.
But anybody can do it.

37
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,495
I mean, you see a woman,
you smile.

38
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:43,831
Pay her a compliment,
ask her her name.

39
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:55,042
It's easy.

40
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:03,351
Can I help you?
Uh, yeah.

41
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,653
Do you have any sweatshirts?
Right over there.

42
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,721
Ah, fantastic.
Yes.

43
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:11,259
And speaking of fantastic,
you have perfect bone structure

44
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:12,760
for having babies.

45
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:18,999
What your name is?
Uh, excuse me.

46
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:22,035
Oh, I see. It's written on
the back of your pants.

47
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:24,405
"Levi Strauss."

48
00:03:24,472 --> 00:03:28,075
Hello, Levi.
My name is Balki.

49
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,043
Hey, where do you
get off anyway?

50
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:34,315
Well, I got off in New York, but
then I took the bus to Chicago.

51
00:03:35,683 --> 00:03:38,252
It's my kind of town,
Chicago is.

52
00:03:40,254 --> 00:03:45,359
Levi, after work, do you want
to have a happy hour with me?

53
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:47,761
Excuse me,
he means no harm.

54
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:51,965
He's from another country.
And he has a head injury.

55
00:03:58,306 --> 00:04:00,508
Don't you give me that face.

56
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:04,345
I did what you told me.
It didn't work.

57
00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:06,179
Balki, that's not
how you meet women.

58
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,416
That's how muggers
meet women.

59
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:14,522
If I pick any losers,
I'll think of you.

60
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,990
Move it. Move it.
Get away from my money.

61
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,263
Well, that's easy.

62
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:28,101
You see a woman, you offer her
50 bucks, not a penny more.

63
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:31,138
I don't think that's the kind
of date he's talking about.

64
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,040
Well, bite my tongue.

65
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:36,744
That mean I don't get to play
St. Francis in the school play?

66
00:04:40,381 --> 00:04:43,751
Balki, you gotta go to a place
where single women hang out.

67
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:45,786
Maybe you should
go to a singles bar.

68
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:48,456
Oh, a singles bar.
I have seen that on TV.

69
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:53,361
"Give me a light.
Go for the gusto."

70
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:55,563
"Here's to good friends."

71
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,398
Will you come with me,
Cousin Larry?

72
00:04:57,465 --> 00:04:59,633
Tonight is kinda special.

73
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:06,407
No, Balki.

74
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:09,377
I prefer more formal
situations, you know, uh,

75
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:14,314
weddings, tax audit,
Heimlich maneuver.

76
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,885
Oh, please, Cousin.

77
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,187
No, I just don't like
those kinds of places.

78
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:23,357
Please, you have to go with me.
You're the love expert.

79
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:26,226
I don't think so.

80
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:30,030
Oh! Bobo.

81
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:34,067
I see. You're afraid if I learn
the secrets of your power

82
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:35,803
I'll misuse it.

83
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,474
Yes, that's it.

84
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,596
So, this is one of your
American mating places?

85
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:05,232
Meeting. A meeting place.

86
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:09,102
People meet each other here.
They mate somewhere else.

87
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:18,178
So many beautiful women.

88
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:21,982
You know, you're right.

89
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,852
You really know your stuff,
Cousin Larry.

90
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:28,155
Well, I think
I'll pick out my woman now.

91
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:32,092
This is not a cafeteria.

92
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:38,966
I know how to be cool.

93
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:47,875
Hey, mama. You be getting
down with your bad self.

94
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,844
What are you doing?

95
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:56,617
Everyone is looking at us.
I don't like that.

96
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:05,593
Now, the first thing
is what we call eye contact.

97
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:08,161
Eye contact.
Like the Three Stooges?

98
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:16,303
All right, I'm gone, outta here.
No, no, Cousin, Cousin.

99
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,105
Okay, okay.

100
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:21,709
Look, for safety's sake, we had
better define eye contact.

101
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:25,913
You look, you look
into a woman's eyes
from across the room.

102
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,782
And if she looks back, you know,
you kind of hold the look.

103
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:30,718
That's eye contact.

104
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:34,855
Like that woman is
looking at you?

105
00:07:36,524 --> 00:07:37,925
What woman?

106
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:42,930
Don't point.

107
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,579
She must be looking
at someone else.

108
00:08:04,752 --> 00:08:06,687
you work your way
over to the woman

109
00:08:06,754 --> 00:08:09,289
and you use your
opening line.

110
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:12,593
Something like,
"Do you come here often?"

111
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,227
"Can I buy you a drink?"

112
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:17,164
"Didn't we meet
in the Oval Office?"

113
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,666
Things like that.

114
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:23,070
Okay.

115
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:38,986
I have made eye contact.

116
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:42,255
Oh, boy.
Can I try my opening line?

117
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:46,259
All right, go ahead.
Just don't tell her you know me.

118
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:54,768
Hello.

119
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:59,940
Do you come here often?
No.

120
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:03,611
Would you smother me with
your beautiful American body?

121
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,881
Excuse us.

122
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:14,021
You were one step away
from throwing yourself

123
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:15,956
at that woman's feet,
weren't you?

124
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:23,897
Why don't you show me, Cousin
Larry? You're the expert.

125
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:26,366
Look. Look, I just don't
like these places.

126
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:31,271
And besides, I'm more of a kind
of a talking expert than a,

127
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:34,574
uh, I really don't
wanna meet anyone.

128
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:39,246
That woman is still
looking at you.

129
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,748
She is?

130
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:44,084
Yes, she is.

131
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:49,089
Oh, my God, she is.

132
00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:51,659
Go ahead and get her,
you love devil.

133
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,228
All right. But this is
a little faster

134
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:57,898
than I usually like
to operate.

135
00:09:57,965 --> 00:10:00,100
I'm only doing this
for you.

136
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:20,187
So--
Hey, that's my girlfriend.

137
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:23,456
Balki, Balki.

138
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:25,893
Balki, Balki.

139
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:34,334
♪ Young girl
get out of my mind

140
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:37,404
♪ My love for you
is way out of line

141
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,373
♪ Better run girl ♪

142
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,175
Cousin Larry, I'm so happy.

143
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:45,178
I met one fox-like
American woman.

144
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:49,750
Sounds like
you had fun, too.

145
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:53,754
Hey, you disappeared
pretty fast.

146
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:56,289
Did you...get lucky?

147
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:00,961
Yeah, I got lucky.

148
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:04,097
I'm lucky I wasn't killed.

149
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:07,134
That's nice.

150
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:15,142
Aren't you happy for me?
Yeah, why not?

151
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:18,178
While you were inside meeting
your fox-like American chick,

152
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:20,013
I was out in
the parking lot

153
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,383
learning that the human body
can bounce off of concrete.

154
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,989
I have so much to learn.

155
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,762
Reams.

156
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:39,566
Well, you can show me
tomorrow night

157
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:42,970
We'll double the pleasure,
double the fun.

158
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:52,312
Let me try to make something
absolutely crystal clear
for you.

159
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,415
I would rather spend the evening
with Jabba the Hutt.

160
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,253
Well, call him up.
We'll all party!

161
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,391
♪ Young girl
get out of my mind ♪

162
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,875
Will you stop it?

163
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:28,782
I'm sorry.
I'm just nervous about my date.

164
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:30,851
She'll love you,
I guarantee it.

165
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:32,452
Well, maybe you're right.

166
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,789
My underarms are safe,
my scalp is not flaky

167
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:38,758
and my breath
is lemon fresh.

168
00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:40,193
Well, other than gargling
with Pledge

169
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,462
I think you're off
to a good start.

170
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:46,699
Hi, guys.
LARRY: Oh, hi, Susan.

171
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,569
So, Balki,
ready for your big date?

172
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:50,871
Well, let me see.

173
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:53,941
I open the door for her,
I pull out the chair

174
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:55,575
I don't speak
with my mouth full

175
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:58,545
and I don't touch her body
unless I am asked.

176
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:02,950
Larry.

177
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:05,919
Well, these are questions
that came up.

178
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:10,657
Please, Cousin Larry,
please come with me.

179
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:17,330
No.
Please.

180
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:21,368
Now, don't worry.
I believe in you.

181
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:29,142
You have got the right stuff.

182
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,279
He is doomed.

183
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:38,986
Larry, why don't you go
with him?
Oh, oh, no, no, no.

184
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:40,453
You're thinking,
Balki's my friend,

185
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,789
my roommate.
A stranger from another country.

186
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:45,692
He looks up to me.
How can I cast him aside?

187
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,194
Like this!

188
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:53,333
Larry--
Nice try.

189
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,602
I don't like
to be embarrassed.

190
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,805
I have spent my life avoiding
embarrassing situations.

191
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:04,544
Who knows when it started?

192
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:06,980
Larry, I don't see
how going on a date

193
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:08,949
with a friend
can be embarrassing.

194
00:14:10,117 --> 00:14:12,619
We are talking about Balki.

195
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:16,456
The man who doesn't believe
the refrigerator light goes off.

196
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:20,827
The man who knows
a thousand and one
unfunny jokes about sheep.

197
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:24,331
The man who thinks Bo Derek
is a fine little actress.

198
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:30,703
And you are telling me that
he's not going to embarrass me?

199
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,906
Take a reality pill.

200
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:39,412
If you're gonna be embarrassed,
don't go.

201
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:43,050
Oh, great,
lay a guilt trip on me.

202
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:46,686
You don't have to tell me
that tonight is going
be a disaster.

203
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:50,157
And you don't have to tell me
how terrible I'm going to feel

204
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,892
if I'm not there
to pick up the pieces.

205
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,861
All right, I'll go.

206
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:57,097
There. I hope you're happy.

207
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:01,468
If it'll be easier for you,
I'll go with you.

208
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:05,805
Oh, sure, come along.

209
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:08,841
I'm gonna go put on my face.
Sure, easy for you.

210
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,510
You get to wear a disguise.

211
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:14,047
She is so manipulative.

212
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:35,568
Don't be shy.
Come, come.

213
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:44,077
So, Diane, what do you do?

214
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:47,414
Good opening line, Cousin Larry,
but she is my date.

215
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,618
I teach high school
geography.

216
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:54,587
That's why I'm so fascinated
by Balki's homeland.

217
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:56,156
It is a fascinating place.

218
00:15:56,223 --> 00:15:58,825
We have no sewers.
And in the rainy season, it--

219
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:01,094
LARRY:
I-I, uh, ahem.

220
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:03,396
I-I come from Wisconsin.

221
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:05,332
That's nice.

222
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:09,069
Oh!

223
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:11,504
Oh, you don't wanna do that.

224
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:14,341
This is the funniest joke
in all of Mypos.

225
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:16,009
It's a small country.

226
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:21,514
These three sheepherders
want to find out

227
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:24,451
who has the most beautiful
sheep in all of Mypos.

228
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:26,886
So they decide to bring
each the prize animal

229
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:28,521
to be judged by the others.

230
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:30,257
Waiter. Waiter!

231
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:37,130
And the others say, "This is
a very beautiful animal.

232
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:39,999
"So big, so white,
so fluffy, good gums."

233
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:42,602
Waiter, yo!

234
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,638
You know this one.
You're so funny.

235
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:49,309
So the next one presents his
sheep, even more beautiful.

236
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:51,611
And then the next
one presents his sheep.

237
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:54,181
But it's just a horrible
looking animal.

238
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:57,717
Skinny, dirty,
wrinkled face.

239
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:02,722
And they say, "This has got
to be the most ugly animal

240
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:08,361
"in the world."

241
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:11,998
and the sheep says,
"You think I'm ugly?

242
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:13,766
"Well, I'm not."

243
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:27,780
And?
That's the punch line.

244
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:33,186
Anybody for the salad bar?
There is no salad bar.

245
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:35,188
There's no punch line either.

246
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:37,056
That didn't stop him.

247
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:40,827
Oh!

248
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:45,098
Hey, you know, this sounds
like a song from my country.

249
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:47,100
Oh no, it doesn't.

250
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:50,403
DIANE: Really?

251
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,439
It's a lovely dance
with lots of people.

252
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:54,841
Oh, look,
they have takeout.

253
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,910
Can you show us the dance?
Oh no. No dancing.

254
00:17:57,977 --> 00:18:01,748
Oh, come on. Show us.
It takes a lot of people.

255
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:05,218
We'll stay here. Susan.
SUSAN: Oh no, come on, Larry.

256
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:07,154
Waiter, check, please.

257
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:16,329
Hey!
Hey!

258
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:18,498
Come on, everybody,
feel the beat.

259
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:20,600
Put on your boogie sandals.

260
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:24,737
Hey!

261
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:27,674
Hey! Hey!

262
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:34,214
"The Dance of Joy" is over.

263
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:37,284
Hey, we're havin' a good time.

264
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:40,887
Dance.
Five, six, seven, eight.

265
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:47,794
ALL: Hey! Hey!

266
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:50,863
Hey! Hey!

267
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:54,234
Hey! Hey!

268
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:04,611
Goodnight, Susan.
Goodnight. I had a great time.

269
00:19:10,417 --> 00:19:16,789
I can't believe it.

270
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:18,425
Isn't life great?

271
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,402
No.

272
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:33,306
I made a fool out of myself.
I am so embarrassed.

273
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:36,175
What

274
00:19:36,243 --> 00:19:38,645
We were having fun.
Fun?

275
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:40,880
I made a public spectacle
out of myself.

276
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:43,316
One threat of death
and I was out there

277
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:46,185
tapping my little feet off.

278
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:48,421
You did not make
a spectacle of yourself.

279
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:50,089
Not even a private one.

280
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:55,495
Of course I did.

281
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:58,465
I am not one of them.
I don't like to sing.

282
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,500
I don't like to dance.

283
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:02,902
People...look at you.

284
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:07,474
But if everyone is singing
and dancing

285
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,476
they don't point
to one man and say,

286
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,978
"Look at that fellow
singing and dancing."

287
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,914
They look at the fellow
who's not singing and dancing.

288
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:18,751
Don't they?

289
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,024
You know what I think?

290
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:28,561
I think you won't admit it, but
you really did have fun tonight.

291
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:30,397
Oh no, I didn't.
Oh, yes, you did.

292
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:31,831
Did not.
You did too.

293
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:32,999
Didn't.

294
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:39,572
You sang.
I didn't enjoy it.

295
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:42,241
You laughed.
A hollow laugh.

296
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:52,785
Well, nobody twisted your leg
to make you do that
Cagney impression.

297
00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:58,257
Well, I got sucked
into the mob mentality.

298
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:02,495
Look, Balki,
you and I are different.

299
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,603
You like to just jump into
the swimming pool of life

300
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:14,073
without even checking to see
if there is water.

301
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,109
I, on the other hand, like
to make sure there's water,

302
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:18,277
a lifeguard

303
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:19,746
test for algae.

304
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:25,685
And then I dip a toe in
and call it a day.

305
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:28,788
I-I shouldn't be
teaching you anything.

306
00:21:28,855 --> 00:21:30,890
I-I don't know
how to have fun.

307
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:34,427
That is not true.

308
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:36,429
You are a fun person.
Really?

309
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:38,698
Yes.
Oh no, I'm not.

310
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:42,301
Yes, you are.

311
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:44,303
Do Cagney for me again.
Oh no.

312
00:21:44,371 --> 00:21:46,406
Oh, come on.
No.

313
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:48,508
Oh, come on.
No, no.

314
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:50,743
Please, or I'll look
at you and point.

315
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:51,811
Okay.

316
00:21:57,717 --> 00:21:59,586
Oh, you dirty rat.

317
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:04,491
You killed my brother,
you dirty rat.

318
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,325
Yeah?

319
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:16,002
Perfect.

320
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:20,039
Now, you see,
don't you feel better?

321
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:22,575
Well, yeah, I do.

322
00:22:22,642 --> 00:22:26,112
You know, I'm gonna try
to loosen up more often.

323
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:29,181
Thanks, Balki.
Oh, I should thank you.

324
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:34,320
If it wasn't for you

325
00:22:34,387 --> 00:22:37,590
You know, you taught me,
if I just relax and be myself

326
00:22:37,657 --> 00:22:39,091
people will like me.

327
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:41,327
And you learned something.

328
00:22:41,394 --> 00:22:43,530
Actually, you learned
the same thing.

329
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,368
I guess so.

330
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:53,473
So you, you really think
I sound like Cagney?

331
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,942
Perfect.
Yeah?

332
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:58,878
Just like Cagney.
Yeah.

333
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:00,580
Can you do Lacey?
