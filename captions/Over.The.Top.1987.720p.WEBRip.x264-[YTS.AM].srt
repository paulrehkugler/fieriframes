(♪ "In This Country" by Eddie Money)

2
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:10,781
Regiment...

3
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,076
Dismissed.

4
00:03:14,244 --> 00:03:16,829
(cheering)

5
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:31,761
(boy) We did it!

6
00:03:31,929 --> 00:03:33,387
You made it.

7
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,142
- You got a fine boy there.
- Thank you.

8
00:03:49,738 --> 00:03:52,740
- Deliveries in the rear.
- I'm picking up Cadet Cutler.

9
00:03:52,908 --> 00:03:55,910
- OK. Pass, sir.
- Thanks.

10
00:04:50,966 --> 00:04:53,551
Who's he?

11
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,515
Smile, everybody.

12
00:04:59,683 --> 00:05:02,393
What's he doing here?

13
00:05:02,561 --> 00:05:06,480
Excuse me.
Can I get you to pay attention?

14
00:05:06,648 --> 00:05:08,774
Forget about him.
Pay attention to me.

15
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:12,445
I'm trying to get a picture here.
Smile.

16
00:05:15,407 --> 00:05:19,327
(boy) Oh, thanks, Dad.
Hey, are we gonna get to see Ma?

17
00:05:19,494 --> 00:05:22,079
Is this the Michael Cutler Limo?

18
00:05:22,247 --> 00:05:23,914
- Yes, sir.
- Where's my grandfather?

19
00:05:24,082 --> 00:05:26,709
He'll be arriving at the airport
in an hour.

20
00:05:27,753 --> 00:05:30,087
- (youth) Cutler!
- Yes, sir!

21
00:05:30,255 --> 00:05:33,799
- The colonel wants to see ya.
- Right away, sir.

22
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:36,302
Wait here.

23
00:05:39,598 --> 00:05:42,975
(indistinct chatter)

24
00:05:52,444 --> 00:05:54,487
- ColoneI Finley.
- Sir.

25
00:06:02,037 --> 00:06:04,747
The colonel wishes to see me, sir.

26
00:06:04,915 --> 00:06:10,086
- Your father wishes to, Cadet.
- My father?

27
00:06:10,253 --> 00:06:14,548
- Yes. He's come to drive you home.
- Hello, Mike.

28
00:06:20,806 --> 00:06:26,477
- I don't have a father, sir.
- This is your father, Michael.

29
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:31,107
My grandfather has instructed me

30
00:06:31,274 --> 00:06:34,193
to go home with no one
besides himself or my mother.

31
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:40,032
Your mother has legal custody
over you. Not your grandfather.

32
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,203
And it is her request
that your father bring you home.

33
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:50,793
- Sir, may I ask a question?
- Of course.

34
00:06:51,837 --> 00:06:54,588
May I see some identification
on this man?

35
00:06:54,756 --> 00:06:58,509
- That's not called for, Cadet.
- That's OK.

36
00:06:59,511 --> 00:07:01,387
I'm ready.

37
00:07:31,793 --> 00:07:35,546
Are we going in this?
Why can't we fly?

38
00:07:35,714 --> 00:07:40,134
Your mother thought it'd be a good
way for us to get to know each other.

39
00:07:40,302 --> 00:07:42,470
How long will it take?

40
00:07:42,637 --> 00:07:45,556
Well, I have one more pickup

41
00:07:45,724 --> 00:07:48,809
and, say, two, three
days we'll be in California.

42
00:07:48,977 --> 00:07:52,980
And your mother doesn't go
into surgery until Wednesday morning.

43
00:07:53,148 --> 00:07:58,068
(sighs) Do you really think you can make
up ten years in two to three days?

44
00:08:00,572 --> 00:08:02,448
No.

45
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:08,954
- Here, let me help you.
- I can do it myself.

46
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:34,772
- I'd like to say something, sir.
- Sure.

47
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,815
This truck is disgusting.

48
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:40,569
I don't know, Mike. It's just old.

49
00:08:40,737 --> 00:08:44,114
Once in a stretch up to Vegas,
this thing got up to...

50
00:08:44,282 --> 00:08:48,953
Sir. There's no need to make
any conversation for my sake.

51
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:53,791
So much for small talk.

52
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:00,548
OK. Here we go.

53
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:29,451
- Can I ask you a question, sir?
- Sure.

54
00:09:29,619 --> 00:09:32,121
How did you get
all these pictures of me?

55
00:09:33,623 --> 00:09:36,709
- Well, your mother sent 'em to me.
- Why?

56
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:39,295
I've been writing to her
for a long time

57
00:09:39,462 --> 00:09:43,340
and I asked for pictures so
I could see how you were growing up.

58
00:09:43,508 --> 00:09:45,718
Looks good.

59
00:09:46,803 --> 00:09:50,514
If you two had been writing,
how come I never got a birthday card,

60
00:09:50,682 --> 00:09:52,349
or a letter, or anything?

61
00:09:52,517 --> 00:09:56,103
- What are you saying, Mike?
- I never heard from you.

62
00:09:56,271 --> 00:09:58,439
I've written to you 100 times.

63
00:09:58,607 --> 00:10:01,859
Birthdays, all the time.
What do you mean, I never...

64
00:10:02,027 --> 00:10:06,655
You must have sent 'em to the wrong
address, cause I never got anything.

65
00:10:09,618 --> 00:10:12,411
Could you pull over?
I'm feeling sick.

66
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:15,873
- What's wrong?
- Would you please pull over, sir?

67
00:10:22,297 --> 00:10:25,007
(man) Hey! Mike!

68
00:10:27,052 --> 00:10:27,926
(honking)

69
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,304
- Mike!
- Look out!

70
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:36,352
- Hey, what the hell are you doing?
- Put a leash on that kid!

71
00:10:45,987 --> 00:10:50,741
Mike, Mike. Stop it. Stop it.

72
00:10:53,161 --> 00:10:56,038
- Stop it.
- (crying) I hate you.

73
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:01,377
Then hate me.
We have to start someplace.

74
00:11:04,172 --> 00:11:05,756
OK?

75
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:11,720
Come on. Let's go back.

76
00:11:17,102 --> 00:11:19,895
- You said you took care of it.
- I did, but...

77
00:11:20,063 --> 00:11:22,481
- Forget it. Forget it!
- Yes, sir.

78
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,402
The boy's mother called, Mr. Cutler.

79
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:29,029
She insisted that Michael leave
with his father.

80
00:11:29,197 --> 00:11:31,031
Don't you understand?

81
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:34,952
My daughter is in no condition
to make that kind of a decision.

82
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,247
I didn't fly all the way up here
to be simply told

83
00:11:38,415 --> 00:11:41,375
you turned my grandson
over to that worthless bastard!

84
00:11:41,543 --> 00:11:44,545
I can't tolerate stupidity.

85
00:11:44,713 --> 00:11:47,923
I'll bring this up
to the attention of the board.

86
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:54,638
I'm sorry about the...

87
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:58,308
I'm sorry about the jacket.

88
00:11:58,476 --> 00:12:02,020
It's no problem.
You'll get the bill.

89
00:12:03,565 --> 00:12:04,940
I'm sure.

90
00:12:05,775 --> 00:12:07,067
(sighs)

91
00:12:07,235 --> 00:12:10,612
If you're hungry, there's a great
place up here for good steak.

92
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,322
What do you say we stop?

93
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:16,535
You're going to be a victim
of cholesterol poisoning.

94
00:12:16,745 --> 00:12:20,330
Later in life,
you'll just start to rot away.

95
00:12:22,584 --> 00:12:26,253
You're just full of good humor,
aren't you, Mike?

96
00:12:26,921 --> 00:12:30,799
Well, let's try it, anyway.

97
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:47,816
- Hey, Linc.
- How you doing, Tom?

98
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:49,693
Just fine.

99
00:12:50,487 --> 00:12:52,362
- Hook me up?
- No problem.

100
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,281
Let's eat, Mike.

101
00:12:55,492 --> 00:12:57,326
(♪ "Bad Night" by Frank Stallone)

102
00:12:57,494 --> 00:13:00,245
(man) Hey, Linc. Good to see you, man.

103
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:08,462
How do you like the place, Mike?

104
00:13:10,131 --> 00:13:12,883
I never did like the zoo, sir.

105
00:13:13,051 --> 00:13:15,010
Why don't you sit down?

106
00:13:15,178 --> 00:13:19,097
- Hey, Linc. Hi. How are you doing?
- Hi, fine.

107
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:22,893
- Martha, this is my kid Mike.
- Well, Mike.

108
00:13:23,061 --> 00:13:27,523
- How do you do, ma'am?
- Ma'am? Whoo! I like that.

109
00:13:27,732 --> 00:13:31,276
So, what'll it be?
A couple of big steaks?

110
00:13:31,486 --> 00:13:33,487
For me. Mike'll have chicken.

111
00:13:33,655 --> 00:13:36,281
- Fried bird. Sure.
- No. Excuse me.

112
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:39,409
For a man who exercises,
you don't know much about nutrition.

113
00:13:39,577 --> 00:13:42,120
A fried chicken dinner
with mashed potatoes

114
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:45,541
has 1,000 calories and 50% fat.

115
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:49,711
These fats have been linked
to heart disease and some cancer.

116
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:51,547
So, what would you like?

117
00:13:51,714 --> 00:13:55,342
Tuna salad, whole wheat toast
and spring water with lemon.

118
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:58,679
- (Martha) OK.
- Double that.

119
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,890
All right.

120
00:14:02,433 --> 00:14:05,602
If you want, we can go
to McDonald's or something.

121
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,646
You Hawk?

122
00:14:09,274 --> 00:14:12,109
- If you're hungry...
- I said, are you Hawk?

123
00:14:13,236 --> 00:14:16,029
- What can I do for you?
- I'm the Smasher.

124
00:14:19,284 --> 00:14:21,243
That's a nice name.

125
00:14:21,452 --> 00:14:25,289
All I've been hearing on the road
is this Hawk is the man to beat.

126
00:14:25,456 --> 00:14:29,167
- Can't believe everything you hear.
- I don't believe anything!

127
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:32,754
I got 1,000 that says
I can tear your arm off.

128
00:14:32,922 --> 00:14:35,132
You want it?

129
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,551
(man) He's trying to back out.

130
00:14:37,719 --> 00:14:39,720
I said, you want it?

131
00:14:42,557 --> 00:14:44,308
Why not?

132
00:14:44,475 --> 00:14:48,270
Let's get this table ready.
I wanna show this guy something.

133
00:14:48,438 --> 00:14:50,147
- Come on.
- Break his arm off.

134
00:14:50,315 --> 00:14:55,485
- Are you gonna fight that guy?
- I can't talk right now, Mike.

135
00:14:55,653 --> 00:14:57,654
Where are you going?

136
00:14:59,157 --> 00:15:01,241
Gotta go to work.

137
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:09,333
- (man) Three on the Hawk!
- (man #2) Four!

138
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,294
(all shouting)

139
00:15:18,468 --> 00:15:19,718
Come on, Linc.

140
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,387
Linc, this guy's insane.

141
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:23,722
(yells)

142
00:15:24,849 --> 00:15:29,269
- (man #3) Three on the Hawk.
- (man #4) Linc, he's yours.

143
00:15:31,105 --> 00:15:34,858
- What are you doing with that guy?
- He's my father.

144
00:15:35,026 --> 00:15:37,027
Too bad.

145
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:44,326
(man) All right!
Start the fight! Start the fight!

146
00:15:47,538 --> 00:15:48,830
Get ready.

147
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:53,168
Get ready. Go!

148
00:15:54,837 --> 00:15:57,339
Shit.

149
00:15:57,507 --> 00:16:00,092
You ain't got it!

150
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:03,804
Get him, Linc!
Come on, Linc! Get him!

151
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:16,733
Come on! You can do it! Come on!

152
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:22,572
(grunts)

153
00:16:24,367 --> 00:16:25,784
Over the top!

154
00:16:30,248 --> 00:16:31,832
Aaagh!

155
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,544
Come on, Linc!

156
00:16:39,007 --> 00:16:40,549
(cheering)

157
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:49,558
Come on, jerk. Give me the money.

162
00:17:00,903 --> 00:17:04,156
- How you doing, Bull?
- Better than you.

163
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:09,119
Right now, double or nothing.
What do you say?

164
00:17:09,287 --> 00:17:11,038
Let's just wait for Vegas.

165

Let's do it now.
I feeI like kicking ass.

166

I'll see you in Vegas.

170
00:17:34,062 --> 00:17:36,730
Get out of the way. Back up.

171
00:17:38,483 --> 00:17:41,151
I'm sorry about that, Mike.

172
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:44,988
You're a hustler. You hustled
that man back there for money.

00:17:45,156 --> 00:17:48,742
- No...
- I'd like to call my mother.

174
00:17:56,584 --> 00:18:01,213
You have to give it time, Michael.
You have to be patient.

175
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:05,550
I know how you feeI,
but you must do it. It's important.

176
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:08,428
I know you want me to do it,
but I don't even know him.

177
00:18:08,596 --> 00:18:11,473
I want you to try.
It's important to me.

178

Why? I thought everything was fine.

179

There's so much more to life
than what you've seen.

00:18:17,855 --> 00:18:22,067
- But he left you.
- He had his reasons.

181
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:24,486
Look, I have to go now,

182
00:18:24,654 --> 00:18:28,323

first, OK? I love you.

OK. I love you too. Bye.

How you doing, honey?

186

Mike, would you hold that? Thank you.

187
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:49,469
Hi, honey. How are you?
Yeah, we're having a great time.

188
00:18:49,637 --> 00:18:54,015
Yeah, he's very helpful. As a matter
of fact, he's helping me right now.

- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

198
00:19:33,347 --> 00:19:37,767
Are you still dealing drugs, sir?
Are you?

199
00:19:37,935 --> 00:19:41,021
You think of that all by yourself?

200
00:19:41,189 --> 00:19:43,732
My grandfather gave me the facts.

201
00:19:46,611 --> 00:19:51,448
The truth is I never did what
your grandfather said I did, Mike.

202

The only mistake I ever made
was leaving. I admit that.

- Angry?

- Have I ever been angry with you?
- Tell me the truth.

All right, I'll tell you the truth.
I'm not angry.

But I am disappointed.

I just wanted him to know his father.

Michael's father is no good.

214
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:58,098
Your wanting to bring him
back in this family is all wrong.

Christina, I know you're worried
about leaving Michael alone.

But surely you understand I'm all

You're not his father.

I have been his father for 12 years!

It's going to turn out all right.

you can use my shoulder for a pillow.

See how I do this?
You put your wrist into it,

246
00:25:22,029 --> 00:25:25,156
you lean forward,
and you put a lot of weight in there.

247
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:27,367
You have to use
your whole body to it.

248
00:25:27,535 --> 00:25:30,787
It's like your body is one piece
of machinery. You try it.

249
00:25:30,955 --> 00:25:35,917
That's it. Good grip.
That's right, lean into it.

250
00:25:36,126 --> 00:25:38,670
You can do it.
Keep your wrist straight. Good.

251
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:41,965
That's it, Mike.
Now put some muscle into it.

There's more to life
than just muscles.

253

Meaning what?

254
00:25:49,306 --> 00:25:51,933
Meaning I don't see any books around.

255
00:25:52,101 --> 00:25:54,143
You don't read much, do you?

256
00:25:54,311 --> 00:25:59,857
No offence, but you're just simply
on a different social scale.

257
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:03,236
Oh, you wanna tell me more
about this social scale?

258
00:26:03,404 --> 00:26:06,864
It's been said that the average
mental age for an adult is 15,

259
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:08,950
just three years older than I am.

260
00:26:09,118 --> 00:26:12,704
For a trucker, it has to be
in the 11 to 13 year range.

Maybe 14, if they have good genetics.

You know, Mike, it's really
great driving with such a...

00:26:20,921 --> 00:26:25,925
...tremendous intellectual like you.
It's a real blessing.

264
00:26:33,851 --> 00:26:35,727
Why are you stopping?

265
00:26:37,646 --> 00:26:39,981
You're aggravated, aren't you?

Since you think it takes
no brains at all,

269
00:26:51,452 --> 00:26:55,496
and I have to be stupid to drive
a truck like this, I tell you what.

270
00:26:55,664 --> 00:26:58,249
Why don't you just
come on over into my seat

271
00:26:58,417 --> 00:27:01,878
and let's see if you can move
this machinery around, OK?

272
00:27:02,046 --> 00:27:04,881
- What?
- Drive, genius.

273
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:17,226
OK, Mike. We got miles to go.

274
00:27:17,394 --> 00:27:21,230
This is an unfair test.
I've never driven a truck before.

275
00:27:21,398 --> 00:27:24,901
- Child's play.
- Let's see, what's the big deal?

276
00:27:25,069 --> 00:27:30,073
Just step on the clutch,
press the gas and switch the gear.

277
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,493
This is no problem.
I once drove a dune buggy.

278
00:27:33,661 --> 00:27:38,414
Mike, I'm impressed. Really.
This'll be no problem at all.

(chuckles)

280
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:48,549
You're doing great, Mike.
Why don't you turn the key? OK?

00:27:48,717 --> 00:27:51,469
Now you see
that little silver button?

282
00:27:52,513 --> 00:27:54,472
Push it.

284
00:27:57,142 --> 00:28:00,978
Magic, huh? Well, Mr. Dune Buggy,
you ready to drive?

285
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:04,774
OK. Push the clutch in all the way.

286
00:28:04,942 --> 00:28:07,443
Give it a lot of leg.

287
00:28:07,611 --> 00:28:10,988
- I don't have anymore.
- No, you can do it. Hold it in.

288
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:13,366
A little bit more. That's it. Good.

289
00:28:13,534 --> 00:28:17,370
Now, give it some gas. Are you ready?

290
00:28:17,538 --> 00:28:20,373
OK. Here we go, Captain Dune Buggy.

291
00:28:20,541 --> 00:28:23,626
Blastoff, right?
Go.

292
00:28:25,879 --> 00:28:28,297
Gas, Mike. A little more gas.

293
00:28:31,593 --> 00:28:34,846
You got an interesting style, Mike.

294
00:28:36,348 --> 00:28:38,516
Hold it steady, Mike.

295
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:41,811
Good. Good. Get it out there.

296
00:28:44,273 --> 00:28:47,066
I'm getting a little sick, Mike.

297

I always wanted to be a milkshake.

298
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:56,075
We're hitting a lot of turbulence.
Let's shift to second gear, OK?

299
00:28:56,243 --> 00:28:58,077
- Clutch all the way in?
- Yeah.

300
00:28:58,245 --> 00:29:01,956
Give it some gas.
You ready? OK, shift.

301
00:29:04,001 --> 00:29:09,672
Wow. I'm impressed. Not bad.
I think we have a natural here.

302
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,260
OK. I think you're about ready
to do it by yourself.

303
00:29:14,428 --> 00:29:17,764
- No!
- Gotta go now, friend.

304
00:29:18,974 --> 00:29:21,100
Go on. Hold it steady.

305
00:29:21,268 --> 00:29:25,313
This is great. I'm really doing it.
This is great!

306
00:29:26,648 --> 00:29:28,691
Now, that wasn't so hard, was it?

307
00:29:28,859 --> 00:29:32,695
- What, sir?
- Smiling.

308
00:29:35,908 --> 00:29:39,452
You're a real natural.
Keep your eye on the road.

00:29:40,913 --> 00:29:44,665
- Here comes Mike.
- All right!

311
00:29:51,131 --> 00:29:54,926
No. You stay out of it
from now on. Right.

312
00:29:56,428 --> 00:29:58,638
- Tim?
- Yes, sir.

313
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:08,523
We're going to have to deal
with this in another fashion.

314
00:30:08,899 --> 00:30:11,776
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

315
00:30:11,944 --> 00:30:14,570
That cake didn't have much
of a chance.

316
00:30:14,738 --> 00:30:17,865
- I was reaI hungry.
- Driving a truck can do that to you.

317
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:21,118
- You ready?
- Yeah. Let's go.

318
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:24,789
- Can I call Mom?
- That's a good idea.

319
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,835
You feeI good?

320
00:30:29,002 --> 00:30:33,422
- Yeah, why?
- I mean, do you feeI strong?

321
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,299
Why?

322
00:30:36,718 --> 00:30:38,970
- Come with me.
- Where are we going?

323
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:42,139
You'll see.
Excuse me.

324
00:30:43,183 --> 00:30:45,726
Did any of you boys ever
arm-wrestle?

325
00:30:45,894 --> 00:30:46,727
Why?

326
00:30:46,895 --> 00:30:50,273
I got a kid here that could beat
any one of you guys

327
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,651
- two out of three times.
- He's a practical joker. Sorry.

328
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:55,319
He's just a shy kid.

329
00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:57,989
I'm so sure
I'm willing to put money on it.

330
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:02,285
Kid, if I couldn't beat you,
I'd kill myself.

331
00:31:02,452 --> 00:31:05,204
- This is getting too intense.
- Relax.

332
00:31:05,372 --> 00:31:07,373
You don't have a chance
against this kid.

333
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:08,666
Yes, he does.

334
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:12,253
Ten to one odds.
Your one against my ten. Fair?

335
00:31:12,421 --> 00:31:15,047
All right. Let's go.
Ten to one odds. Right here.

336
00:31:15,215 --> 00:31:16,757
(Hawk) Two out of three times.

337
00:31:16,925 --> 00:31:19,343
You should take that off.
That's not fair.

338
00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:22,138
- You'll take him easy.
- (Hawk) No gloves allowed.

339
00:31:22,306 --> 00:31:25,433
OK. Concentrate, Mike. You can do it.

340
00:31:25,601 --> 00:31:28,269
All right, let's start.
Ready, wimp?

341
00:31:28,437 --> 00:31:30,396
His skin feels like a girl's.

342
00:31:30,564 --> 00:31:31,606
- Maybe he is a girl.
- Probably.

343
00:31:31,773 --> 00:31:34,150
Don't listen to 'em. You hear?

344
00:31:34,318 --> 00:31:37,445
- Kill him.
- You're gonna show 'em now.

345
00:31:37,613 --> 00:31:41,032
You're gonna do it.
Over the top, Mike. Ready?

346
00:31:41,742 --> 00:31:43,492
- Start. Come on.
- Break his arm.

347
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:47,830
Get this little wuss!
Blow the fruit away!

348
00:31:47,998 --> 00:31:51,292
- Come on, man! All the way!
- Come on!

349
00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:57,590
- Yeah!
- Yeah, man!

350
00:31:57,758 --> 00:32:00,927
- Aw, look at the baby.
- Aw, little baby. Little baby.

351
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,597
- Two out of three.
- Ten out of ten.

352
00:32:04,765 --> 00:32:07,183
- Any day, man.
- We'll take anything, man.

353
00:32:07,351 --> 00:32:09,685
Mike!

354
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:14,607
What are you trying to do?

355
00:32:14,775 --> 00:32:18,444
All you wanted to do
was embarrass me. You did it, OK?

356
00:32:18,612 --> 00:32:20,655
Grandfather said you were a loser.

357
00:32:20,822 --> 00:32:24,283
You're trying to make me one
and I hate you for it!

358
00:32:24,451 --> 00:32:28,245
Mike, I don't care what your
grandfather thinks about me, OK?

359
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:30,164
All I care about is you.

360
00:32:30,332 --> 00:32:33,125
Now you lost back there
because you beat yourself.

361
00:32:33,293 --> 00:32:34,752
You let yourself get beat.

362
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,588
I know you can do it.
You're a special kid.

363
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:39,465
You're my boy, do you understand?

364
00:32:39,633 --> 00:32:42,134
But you're also a spoiled, rich brat

365
00:32:42,302 --> 00:32:44,512
who's always had everything
done for him.

366
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,431
It's time to do it for yourself,
and you can do it.

367
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:52,061
The world meets nobody halfway.
Do you understand that?

368
00:32:52,229 --> 00:32:55,564
If you want it, Mike,
you gotta take it.

369
00:32:55,732 --> 00:33:00,069
Do you hear me? Go in there and try.
I know you can win.

370
00:33:00,237 --> 00:33:02,989
But even if you don't, so what?
So you lose.

371
00:33:03,156 --> 00:33:06,575
As long as you lose like a winner,
it doesn't matter.

372
00:33:06,743 --> 00:33:08,327
Cause you did it with dignity.

373
00:33:08,495 --> 00:33:11,080
If you don't go in there,
you're gonna be sorry.

374
00:33:11,248 --> 00:33:14,417
You'll regret it your whole life,
you know what I mean?

375
00:33:14,584 --> 00:33:18,963
Go on. I know you can do it.
Will you do it for me?

376
00:33:20,882 --> 00:33:23,300
Come on. Let's get him.

377
00:33:26,763 --> 00:33:27,680
You can beat him.

378
00:33:27,848 --> 00:33:32,560
You're twice as strong as he is.
You just gotta believe. All right?!

379
00:33:33,854 --> 00:33:36,147
I thought you said he was strong.

380
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:38,858
Well, my boy was just
feeling generous.

381
00:33:39,026 --> 00:33:41,610
Now it's time to go to work.
Huh, Mike?

382
00:33:47,784 --> 00:33:52,288
- It's time to go to work, kid.
- Yeah.

383
00:33:52,456 --> 00:33:55,624
- Does he think he can take me?
- I don't think so.

384
00:33:55,792 --> 00:33:56,917
- Lock wrists.
- What a joke.

385
00:33:57,085 --> 00:33:59,545
(boy) Through the table. Smash him.

386
00:33:59,713 --> 00:34:03,215
This is gonna hurt, wimp.
What do you think of that?

387
00:34:03,383 --> 00:34:06,969
- I think your breath stinks.
- Go!

388
00:34:07,137 --> 00:34:10,514
- (boys shouting)
- Come on, Mike. That's good.

389
00:34:10,682 --> 00:34:13,392
Come on, Mike. Drop the weight.

390
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,563
Over the top, Mike. Come on.
Get tough. Pump it, kid.

391
00:34:17,731 --> 00:34:20,399
You got him, Mike.
You got him! You got him!

392
00:34:20,567 --> 00:34:23,694
Come on! A little bit more.
You got him!

393
00:34:24,154 --> 00:34:28,532
All right!
All right. Way to go.

394
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:32,453
- Come on, man. Do it again!
- He cheated. Come on. One more time.

395
00:34:32,621 --> 00:34:35,331
Let's go, Mike. Right away.

396
00:34:35,499 --> 00:34:39,585
- I'm gonna break your arm, punk!
- Come on. Get mad. Ready? Go!

397
00:34:39,753 --> 00:34:41,712
(Hawk) Come on, Mike.
You can beat him.

398
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:45,257
Harder, Mike. Over the top.
Pump it, kid.

399
00:34:45,425 --> 00:34:48,803
The power, Mike.
Over the top.

400
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:52,598
Hey! Good, Mike.
All right. Way to go.

401
00:34:52,766 --> 00:34:54,809
You're a tough little sucker,
aren't you?

402
00:34:54,976 --> 00:34:57,812
That was great. Pay up now.

403
00:34:57,979 --> 00:35:00,815
- Money, please.
- Money.

404
00:35:03,151 --> 00:35:07,738
- How did he do that?
- Good genetics.

405
00:35:07,906 --> 00:35:11,700
- Thanks. Let's go.
- Let's talk to Mom.

406
00:35:11,868 --> 00:35:15,496
- I'll beat you every day, man.
- Come on. Right now!

407
00:35:15,872 --> 00:35:18,707
I drove Dad's truck and
I'm a good driver.

408
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:19,750
Great driver.

409
00:35:19,918 --> 00:35:23,671
And I had this arm-wrestling match
with some guy who was bigger.

410
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,298
- Maybe 5'6".
- Bigger.

411
00:35:26,466 --> 00:35:28,801
- No, 5'9".
- Bigger.

412
00:35:28,969 --> 00:35:33,139
Mom, you wouldn't believe it.
This guy was a monster!

413
00:35:33,306 --> 00:35:37,226
Oh, that's good, darling.
I'm so proud of you.

414
00:35:37,394 --> 00:35:41,355
Is your father there?
Let me speak to him, OK?

415
00:35:41,523 --> 00:35:45,860
- I love you, sweetheart.
- OK. I love you too.

416
00:35:46,027 --> 00:35:49,738
- She sounds so weak.
- She'll be all right.

417
00:35:49,906 --> 00:35:52,241
- I'm gonna be outside.
- OK, champ.

418
00:35:52,409 --> 00:35:53,826
Hi, honey.

419
00:35:53,994 --> 00:35:55,828
Oh, yeah, it was a great idea

420
00:35:55,996 --> 00:35:58,122
he and I spending time
like this together.

421
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:02,042
I hope so. I know it won't be easy.

422
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:07,006
Oh, no, everything's gonna be great.
I know it is. So, how you feeling?

423
00:36:07,174 --> 00:36:11,218
Linc, whatever happens,
I want you to stay with him.

424
00:36:11,386 --> 00:36:16,765
I know how difficult it is for you,
but it's really important.

425
00:36:16,933 --> 00:36:20,644
- He needs you, honey.
- I will.

426
00:36:20,812 --> 00:36:23,939
Please try to make things work
between you and my father.

427
00:36:24,107 --> 00:36:26,275
He's too set in his ways to change,

428
00:36:26,443 --> 00:36:30,154
maybe you can try and understand him.

429
00:36:30,322 --> 00:36:32,907
I'll try.

430
00:36:33,116 --> 00:36:36,827
OK. I can't wait to see you both.

431
00:36:37,037 --> 00:36:42,041
Christina, he's a great kid.
And I'll see you soon, OK?

432
00:36:42,209 --> 00:36:43,667
OK.

433
00:36:43,835 --> 00:36:45,753
- Dad!
- OK. Bye.

434
00:36:46,963 --> 00:36:47,963
Mike!

435
00:36:48,131 --> 00:36:51,258
- (Mike) Dad!
- Mike!

436
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:58,390
Come on. (grunts)

437
00:37:08,318 --> 00:37:11,904
(Mike) Dad! Dad!

438
00:37:13,406 --> 00:37:15,491
- Why are you doing this?
- Shut up!

439
00:37:19,746 --> 00:37:21,997
- Come on, Dad!
- Quiet, kid.

440
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:24,583
(honking)

441
00:37:25,877 --> 00:37:27,336
(honking)

442
00:37:30,382 --> 00:37:31,632
He's still coming.

443
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:35,427
- Oh, shit. Here he comes.
- Dad!

444
00:37:57,701 --> 00:38:01,328
Come on! Let's get the hell
out of here! Hurry!

445
00:38:03,081 --> 00:38:07,835
He's staying with me!
You tell him that! You tell him!

446
00:38:08,044 --> 00:38:11,338
- You OK? You all right?
- Yeah. Are you OK?

447
00:38:11,506 --> 00:38:13,924
- I'm all right.
- Yeah, you'll live.

448
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:17,553
Thanks. Come on.
You sure you're OK?

449
00:38:17,721 --> 00:38:18,554
Yeah.

450
00:38:19,681 --> 00:38:22,016
Who were those guys anyway?

451
00:38:23,018 --> 00:38:25,144
Better ask your grandfather.

452
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:29,273
- (sighs) Look at my truck.
- Oh, man.

453
00:38:29,441 --> 00:38:32,568
(siren)

454
00:38:41,953 --> 00:38:44,538
- I got here as soon as I could.
- Yes.

455
00:38:44,706 --> 00:38:47,124
We don't have much
of a custody case.

456
00:38:47,292 --> 00:38:48,792
Why the hell is that?

457
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,003
I had my best researchers run down

458
00:38:51,171 --> 00:38:54,506
every applicable court case
for the last 100 years.

459
00:38:54,674 --> 00:39:00,095
Bottom line, Jason: no judge is going
to award you custody of Michael.

460
00:39:00,263 --> 00:39:03,849
The court will give him to Hawk
unless he can't support him.

461
00:39:04,017 --> 00:39:07,186
How can he support him?
The son of a bitch lost everything.

462
00:39:07,354 --> 00:39:09,313
He can't even support himself!

463
00:39:09,481 --> 00:39:12,066
Anyway, there's always
a way to bend the law.

464
00:39:12,233 --> 00:39:15,778
Isn't it your job?!
Why don't you find the loophole?

465
00:39:15,945 --> 00:39:18,447
I want my boy.

466
00:39:31,795 --> 00:39:34,004
- Come on. Over the top. (chuckles)
- Over the top.

467
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,759
Oh, oh. Mercy, mercy, mercy.

468
00:39:41,554 --> 00:39:45,015
You're getting too good.
You're gonna be a great one, kid.

469
00:39:45,183 --> 00:39:47,518
- Almost as good as you, right?
- Well...

470
00:39:47,727 --> 00:39:49,978
I think you'll be better than me.

471
00:39:50,188 --> 00:39:51,438
Think you're gonna
do good in Vegas?

472
00:39:51,606 --> 00:39:53,190
I'm betting on it.

473
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,653
I'd like to get enough money together
and buy a small company,

474
00:39:57,821 --> 00:40:01,031
and hire some smart guy
like you to be president.

475
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:03,742
- That's not a bad idea.
- It's a great idea.

476
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:08,288
- But what if you lose?
- You're not supposed to say that.

477
00:40:08,456 --> 00:40:12,418
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

478
00:40:13,837 --> 00:40:15,671
Why'd you leave us?

479
00:40:16,965 --> 00:40:18,590
Well...

480
00:40:20,176 --> 00:40:25,180
- I had some reasons.
- That's not an answer.

481
00:40:25,348 --> 00:40:28,976
All I can say, Mike,
is I made a mistake. I know that.

482
00:40:29,144 --> 00:40:32,479
Sometimes it happens in life.
We all make mistakes.

483
00:40:35,984 --> 00:40:38,485
But it won't happen again.

484
00:40:40,405 --> 00:40:44,366
- Yeah, you're gonna be a great one.
- Think so?

485
00:40:44,534 --> 00:40:48,454
Yes. I'm glad I'm not going
against you, tough guy.

486
00:40:57,797 --> 00:41:02,468
We saved the patient.
But before in the ICU...

487
00:41:03,094 --> 00:41:05,471
...well, we had a little problem.

488
00:41:05,638 --> 00:41:08,348
- You OK?
- Yeah. How do I look?

489
00:41:08,516 --> 00:41:10,976
You look great.
You're not nervous, are you?

490
00:41:11,144 --> 00:41:12,769
Come on, let's go see her.

491
00:41:17,817 --> 00:41:20,277
Excuse me,
could you tell me what room

492
00:41:20,445 --> 00:41:23,989
- Mrs. Christina Hawk is in, please?
- What is she admitted for?

493
00:41:24,157 --> 00:41:28,035
Heart surgery. She'd probably be
in a private room.

494
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:34,208
- Can I ask who you are?
- I'm her husband.

495
00:41:34,375 --> 00:41:38,295
Possibly you'd rather talk to one
of the doctors on the case.

496
00:41:38,463 --> 00:41:42,007
- Why, what's wrong?
- Excuse me.

497
00:42:04,155 --> 00:42:07,491
Mr. Hawk, I'm sorry.

498
00:42:07,659 --> 00:42:10,953
Your wife died this afternoon
in the operating room.

499
00:42:12,413 --> 00:42:13,622
No.

500
00:42:29,973 --> 00:42:31,265
Mike.

501
00:42:33,059 --> 00:42:34,142
Mike!

502
00:42:37,522 --> 00:42:39,356
(crying)

503
00:42:39,524 --> 00:42:40,607
Mike.

504
00:42:42,777 --> 00:42:46,196
If you wouldn't have come
to pick me up, I would've seen her.

505
00:42:46,364 --> 00:42:50,909
I wouldn't be riding around in that
truck while she was dying.

506
00:42:51,077 --> 00:42:52,578
Nobody knew, Mike.

507
00:42:52,745 --> 00:42:56,582
You've never been around
when anybody needed you.

508
00:42:56,749 --> 00:43:02,546
Taxi! Take me to the Cutler estate.
I'm going home.

509
00:43:02,714 --> 00:43:04,506
Mike.

510
00:43:06,217 --> 00:43:07,217
Mike!

511
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,267
(minister) We are gathered here
to commit the body

512
00:43:15,435 --> 00:43:20,897
of Christina Marie Cutler Hawk
to the ground from which it came.

513
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:24,234
We commend her souI to the Lord

514
00:43:24,402 --> 00:43:26,820
that in His mercy...

515
00:43:27,947 --> 00:43:29,781
That must be the husband.

516
00:43:38,249 --> 00:43:42,794
(minister)... that in His mercy,
she may attain everlasting life.

517
00:43:42,962 --> 00:43:46,214
And now, let us pray
with the Psalmist.

518
00:43:46,382 --> 00:43:51,345
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

519
00:43:51,512 --> 00:43:55,140
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

520
00:43:55,308 --> 00:43:58,352
He leadeth me
beside the still waters.

521
00:43:58,519 --> 00:44:00,729
He restoreth my souI.

522
00:44:00,897 --> 00:44:05,359
He leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness for his name's sake.

523
00:44:05,526 --> 00:44:10,030
Surely goodness and mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life

524
00:44:10,198 --> 00:44:14,159
and will dwell
in the house of the Lord forever.

525
00:45:32,822 --> 00:45:34,489
Yes?

526
00:45:34,657 --> 00:45:37,784
I'd like to talk
to Jason Cutler, please.

527
00:45:37,952 --> 00:45:39,494
You're not wanted here.

528
00:45:40,663 --> 00:45:44,124
Would you tell him Lincoln Hawk
would like to talk to him?

529
00:45:44,292 --> 00:45:46,668
Like I said, you're not wanted here.

530
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,675
I want to see my boy.

531
00:45:53,843 --> 00:45:56,052
Move it out.

532
00:45:58,973 --> 00:46:04,227
Move. Get this thing the hell
out of here before I call the police.

533
00:46:17,116 --> 00:46:18,784
(engine starts)

534
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:31,588
That guy ain't coming back.
He's a loser.

535
00:46:39,931 --> 00:46:41,598
(guard yelling)

536
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:50,190
(guard) Stop! What are you doing?!
Get back here!

537
00:47:00,618 --> 00:47:03,203
(guard #2) Call the cops!
I'm going around back!

538
00:47:07,166 --> 00:47:11,211
Mike! Mike!

539
00:47:11,379 --> 00:47:13,296
Hawk!

540
00:47:13,464 --> 00:47:15,924
What the hell have you done?

541
00:47:16,092 --> 00:47:18,009
Mike.

542
00:47:19,345 --> 00:47:22,889
Come with me, please. Mike, please.

543
00:47:23,057 --> 00:47:27,686
Do you actually think that you can
get away with what you've done?

544
00:47:27,854 --> 00:47:30,438
You think you can come in here,
destroy my home

545
00:47:30,606 --> 00:47:33,859
and take Michael with you?
Michael Cutler is my boy!

546
00:47:34,026 --> 00:47:36,820
You deserted him years ago!

547
00:47:36,988 --> 00:47:41,116
That's a fact that you can't change
no matter what you do! Damn you!

548
00:47:41,284 --> 00:47:43,159
Damn you.

549
00:47:44,495 --> 00:47:47,789
Dad! Dad!

550
00:47:48,916 --> 00:47:51,710
Come on, let him go!

551
00:47:51,878 --> 00:47:54,838
- Go to your room.
- Please! Dad!

552
00:47:55,006 --> 00:47:59,384
- Go to your room.
- Come on, Grandfather!

553
00:47:59,552 --> 00:48:00,760
(siren)

554
00:48:00,928 --> 00:48:04,014
Go to your room now! Go!

555
00:48:04,223 --> 00:48:07,434
Mike. Mike.

556
00:48:07,643 --> 00:48:10,937
We got him. Let him go.
Keep his arms behind him.

557
00:48:13,608 --> 00:48:14,900
You have the right to remain silent.

558
00:48:15,067 --> 00:48:16,651
If you give up the right
to remain silent...

559
00:48:16,819 --> 00:48:19,821
All the way out. Slowly.

560
00:48:58,152 --> 00:48:59,569
Move your ass.

561
00:49:02,365 --> 00:49:04,950
You Hawk? Let's go.

562
00:49:06,744 --> 00:49:08,787
Wait here.

563
00:49:13,918 --> 00:49:15,335
Straight ahead.

564
00:49:16,337 --> 00:49:19,089
There's somebody here
to see you, Hawk.

565
00:49:32,019 --> 00:49:35,188
- Yeah, right over there.
- Sit down.

566
00:49:40,486 --> 00:49:42,654
I'll make this brief, Hawk.

567
00:49:42,822 --> 00:49:46,032
I'm Tim Salanger,
Mr. Cutler's personaI secretary.

568
00:49:46,242 --> 00:49:49,452
As you can see, you've got
a serious problem on your hands.

569
00:49:49,662 --> 00:49:53,832
More than ever now, you'll need money
for attorneys, additional expenses.

570
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,960
What we want is for you
to leave the state.

571
00:49:57,128 --> 00:50:00,005
Don't come back, we won't prosecute.

572
00:50:00,172 --> 00:50:03,800
If you decide to contest
the whole matter of legal custody,

573
00:50:03,968 --> 00:50:08,263
you won't have a prayer.
We retain the finest law firms.

574
00:50:11,183 --> 00:50:14,686
That's it. What do you say?

575
00:50:16,981 --> 00:50:21,443
- What's Mike say?
- Ask him yourself.

576
00:50:29,618 --> 00:50:31,286
Michael.

577
00:50:40,046 --> 00:50:42,630
At ease, Mike.

578
00:50:49,013 --> 00:50:52,474
Now, you're not gonna tell me
to leave too, are you?

579
00:50:53,809 --> 00:50:54,684
No.

580
00:50:54,935 --> 00:50:58,855
That's good. I was beginning
to think I wasn't popular.

581
00:51:02,151 --> 00:51:05,111
I don't know what to think.

582
00:51:06,864 --> 00:51:09,824
Mike, I know you don't trust me.

583
00:51:11,744 --> 00:51:14,579
I don't blame you.
I haven't earned that yet.

584
00:51:18,125 --> 00:51:21,503
I just feeI like I have a home here.

585
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:23,296
You know, I...

586
00:51:24,507 --> 00:51:29,719
I mean, if I went with you,
where would we go?

587
00:51:29,887 --> 00:51:32,555
Where would we end up?

588
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:40,939
Together is all I can guarantee.

589
00:51:42,483 --> 00:51:47,320
You say this now, and then you leave.

590
00:51:50,825 --> 00:51:57,330
Mike, I'm just a father who messed up
pretty bad, I know that.

591
00:51:58,290 --> 00:52:02,001
I've done things real wrong.

592
00:52:02,169 --> 00:52:06,297
Now I want to try to fix
everything up as best as I can.

593
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:10,760
And I want to...

594
00:52:12,054 --> 00:52:16,766
...give you what's inside of me.

595
00:52:16,934 --> 00:52:21,062
I may not have much
and I may never have a lot.

596
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:26,067
But I've got something inside
I want to give to the only person

597
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:31,406
who means something to me.
You.

598
00:52:32,783 --> 00:52:34,784
You.

599
00:52:40,624 --> 00:52:42,709
I can't.

600
00:52:43,836 --> 00:52:46,296
I can't go with you.

601
00:52:52,178 --> 00:52:54,095
Can't?

602
00:52:55,764 --> 00:52:58,433
I'm sorry.

603
00:53:16,243 --> 00:53:18,661
I understand.

604
00:53:27,713 --> 00:53:32,091
Mike, I want you
to remember something.

605
00:53:36,263 --> 00:53:40,350
The world meets nobody halfway,
remember that.

606
00:53:42,645 --> 00:53:48,691
You gotta do what's best for you.
Always do that.

607
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:07,043
Should I draw up the papers?

608
00:54:13,842 --> 00:54:16,219
Yeah.

609
00:54:58,846 --> 00:55:02,598
(♪ "Meet Me Half Way")

610
00:55:27,541 --> 00:55:30,126
(man) I appreciate your feelings
about your truck.

611
00:55:30,836 --> 00:55:36,841
Best offer I can make,
cash though, 7,000.

612
00:55:37,468 --> 00:55:41,179
- Take it or leave it.
- Not giving me much of a choice.

613
00:55:41,347 --> 00:55:45,058
OK, you got a deal mental.

614
00:55:47,353 --> 00:55:49,937
I'd like to keep the hawk,
though, OK?

615
00:55:50,731 --> 00:55:52,398
(man) Take it.

616
00:56:32,981 --> 00:56:37,402
(announcer) Good morning. I'd like to
welcome all of you to this year's...

617
00:56:52,751 --> 00:56:56,879
- What are the odds on Lincoln Hawk?
- The odds on Hawk?

618
00:56:57,047 --> 00:56:59,173
Lincoln Hawk's 20 to one.

619
00:56:59,341 --> 00:57:02,635
20 to one, paI. ReaI long shot.

620
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,597
I'd like to bet 7,000 on him.

621
00:57:06,765 --> 00:57:08,850
That's what I call gambling.

622
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:23,322
(man) Linc Hawk...

623
00:57:25,075 --> 00:57:27,201
John Grizzly: 238.

624
00:57:44,761 --> 00:57:47,346
190? Thanks.

625
00:57:47,514 --> 00:57:53,811
That's wrong. Excuse me, buddy.
Hold on a second. John Grizzly: 238.

626
00:58:11,705 --> 00:58:14,373
(announcer) Italian competitors,
report to your coach.

627
00:58:16,335 --> 00:58:20,838
What are you doing?
Where are you going? Stop!

628
00:58:21,006 --> 00:58:22,507
(announcer) Arm wrestling is
a combination of

629
00:58:22,674 --> 00:58:24,133
speed, strength and technique,

630
00:58:24,301 --> 00:58:29,472
coupled with mental attitude
and dedication.

631
00:58:34,269 --> 00:58:37,438
- (driver) Come on!
- Move it! Go!

632
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:42,318
(announcer) Soon,
the preliminaries will be under way.

633
00:58:57,459 --> 00:58:59,835
- (car horn)
- (man) Hey, you idiot!

634
00:59:01,547 --> 00:59:06,634
(announcer) Welcome to the arm wrestling
world championship competition.

635
00:59:06,802 --> 00:59:09,512
(cheering)

636
00:59:11,431 --> 00:59:14,600
(announcer) There are seven different
weight classes for men and women.

637
00:59:14,768 --> 00:59:19,981
They come from all over the world:
Japan, France, Italy, Switzerland.

638
00:59:20,148 --> 00:59:23,234
Truly the best arm wrestlers
in the entire world.

639
00:59:23,402 --> 00:59:24,652
(yells)

640
00:59:24,987 --> 00:59:27,238
One reminder, once again,

641
00:59:27,406 --> 00:59:29,365
this is a double elimination
competition.

642
00:59:29,533 --> 00:59:32,034
You have to lose twice to be out.

643
00:59:32,202 --> 00:59:36,455
In other words, if you lose once,
you still have one more chance.

644
00:59:36,623 --> 00:59:41,294
The preliminary rounds this morning
and the men's finals tonight.

645
00:59:41,461 --> 00:59:45,756
And don't forget the women. They're
competing for $50,000 in prize money.

646
00:59:45,924 --> 00:59:49,468
Are we ready, referees?
Start the competition!

647
00:59:49,636 --> 00:59:52,013
Good luck to all of you!

648
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:53,681
Ready? Go!

649
00:59:54,391 --> 00:59:55,391
Ready? Go!

650
00:59:55,559 --> 00:59:57,935
(♪ "Winner Takes ItAII" by Sammy Hagar)

651
00:59:58,103 --> 01:00:00,313
You ain't shit!

652
01:00:08,363 --> 01:00:09,864
(referee) Winner: Bull Hurley.

653
01:00:10,699 --> 01:00:14,493
(announcer) A win for the five-time
world champion, Bull Hurley!

654
01:00:19,791 --> 01:00:21,250
(referee) Go!

655
01:00:23,712 --> 01:00:24,962
Winner!

656
01:00:31,595 --> 01:00:33,888
That's a winner!

657
01:00:37,601 --> 01:00:41,520
(announcer) Frenchman André Bouvier,
and a newcomer, Lincoln Hawk.

658
01:00:41,688 --> 01:00:44,523
And Hawk takes the win!
He'll be one to watch.

659
01:00:46,693 --> 01:00:49,111
On to the teamster.
Harry Bosco has the win.

660
01:00:53,408 --> 01:00:57,203
Hey, boy. You just can't leave
this truck here like that.

661
01:00:57,871 --> 01:00:59,622
You can keep it.

662
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:03,959
Hey, you! Come back here!
Come here, you!

663
01:01:05,045 --> 01:01:08,506
(announcer) Billy Bob from Texas,
the southern champion.

664
01:01:08,674 --> 01:01:09,840
He'll be tough to beat here.

665
01:01:18,016 --> 01:01:22,645
There. There's our car.
Take me to Mr. Cutler's plane.

666
01:01:22,854 --> 01:01:23,938
Go!

667
01:01:24,106 --> 01:01:25,398
- Go!
- Go!

668
01:01:27,317 --> 01:01:29,193
(yells)

669
01:01:32,989 --> 01:01:34,115
Winner!

670
01:01:34,282 --> 01:01:35,950
(announcer) We have trouble
with our German friend.

671
01:01:36,118 --> 01:01:38,828
Looks like an injury on table three.

672
01:01:38,995 --> 01:01:40,371
(yells)

673
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:44,166
Ready? Go!

674
01:01:44,334 --> 01:01:45,459
Winner!

675
01:01:56,096 --> 01:01:58,055
Chicken shit.

676
01:02:03,687 --> 01:02:06,981
(announcer) We're already down
to the last 32 competitors.

677
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:11,861
Bull Hurley.
He's still the man to beat.

678
01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:13,821
He's not to make it to the Hilton.
Is that understood?

679
01:02:13,989 --> 01:02:15,906
Yes, sir.

680
01:02:18,201 --> 01:02:19,368
Come on! Grizzly!

681
01:02:19,536 --> 01:02:23,080
- (growls)
- (yells)

682
01:02:30,881 --> 01:02:32,006
Come on!

683
01:02:32,174 --> 01:02:33,841
Come on! Come on!

684
01:02:35,886 --> 01:02:37,052
Winner!

685
01:02:45,353 --> 01:02:47,354
(announcer) And that concludes
the women's competition.

686
01:02:48,523 --> 01:02:50,483
Mr. John Grizzly!

687
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:57,448
- Winner!
- Winner!

688
01:03:01,286 --> 01:03:03,704
- (cheering)
- Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

689
01:03:03,872 --> 01:03:07,625
Welcome back to our
world championship competition.

690
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:15,674
We're approaching the main event.
First of all, the semifinals.

691
01:03:15,842 --> 01:03:18,469
Fighting will take place
on these four tables

692
01:03:18,637 --> 01:03:22,890
and the eight best arm wrestlers
in the world will be competing.

693
01:03:29,481 --> 01:03:32,399
- There's Michael.
- I'll cover the back.

694
01:03:33,485 --> 01:03:35,778
(announcer) They've come from
every nation on earth.

695
01:03:35,946 --> 01:03:38,739
500 competitors started.

696
01:03:38,907 --> 01:03:41,492
Now we're down to the final eight.

697
01:03:47,707 --> 01:03:50,835
Let me remind you.
Let me remind you, please.

698
01:03:51,002 --> 01:03:54,004
This is a double elimination
competition.

699
01:03:54,172 --> 01:03:56,966
If you lose twice, you're out.

700
01:03:57,133 --> 01:03:59,426
Double elimination competition.

701
01:04:07,394 --> 01:04:09,103
They've come from everywhere

702
01:04:09,271 --> 01:04:14,066
for a chance to win $100,000
in prize money.

703
01:04:14,234 --> 01:04:16,694
They will also have
the opportunity to win

704
01:04:16,862 --> 01:04:21,240
a $250,000 Volvo White tractor truck.

705
01:04:22,450 --> 01:04:26,954
Right now, though, let's introduce
our eight semifinalists.

706
01:04:28,081 --> 01:04:30,583
They're the best
in the world of arm wrestling.

707
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:32,918
Let's introduce John Grizzly,

708
01:04:33,086 --> 01:04:37,089
three-time winner from the
World Arm Wrestling Association.

709
01:04:37,257 --> 01:04:40,926
When I get to the table, that person,
I don't care who they are,

710
01:04:41,094 --> 01:04:43,345
is my mortal enemy.
I hate them.

711
01:04:43,513 --> 01:04:46,348
(announcer) John Grizzly, right here.

712
01:04:46,516 --> 01:04:49,852
Also coming up here, Mad Dog Madison.

713
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:53,397
I'm not so enthused about people
patting me on the back,

714
01:04:53,565 --> 01:04:57,359
saying "You're the best. "
I don't need people to do that to me.

715
01:04:57,527 --> 01:05:01,947
If I win, it's just because I wanted
to be the best, one time in my life.

716
01:05:02,115 --> 01:05:04,617
Mad Dog Madison.

717
01:05:04,784 --> 01:05:07,244
Harry Bosco, right here.

718
01:05:07,412 --> 01:05:09,288
My whole body is an engine.

719
01:05:09,456 --> 01:05:12,875
This is a fireplug and
I'm going to light him up.

720
01:05:13,043 --> 01:05:16,086
- (yells)
- (announcer) Harry Bosco!

721
01:05:16,254 --> 01:05:20,466
The Canadian champion,
two years running: CarI Adams.

722
01:05:20,634 --> 01:05:23,344
I should be able
to blow them away real easy.

723
01:05:23,511 --> 01:05:25,804
There's a lot more
technique involved,

724
01:05:25,972 --> 01:05:28,015
and you can't beat experience.

725
01:05:28,183 --> 01:05:29,183
(yells)

726
01:05:29,351 --> 01:05:30,726
(announcer) CarI Adams,
ladies and gentlemen.

727
01:05:32,604 --> 01:05:37,399
And the newcomer from the truckers'
division, Lincoln Hawk, over here.

728
01:05:37,567 --> 01:05:41,403
To tell you the truth, the truck
is the most important thing for me.

729
01:05:41,571 --> 01:05:43,572
I don't really...

730
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:47,785
It doesn't matter
if I become the champion or anything.

731
01:05:47,953 --> 01:05:52,831
That's not the most important...
I need this truck.

732
01:05:52,999 --> 01:05:55,501
(announcer) Lincoln Hawk,
from the truckers' division.

733
01:05:56,795 --> 01:05:58,337
And finally,

734
01:05:58,505 --> 01:06:02,424
five-time arm wrestling
world champion Bull Hurley!

735
01:06:02,592 --> 01:06:05,552
- Let's hear it for Bull.
- (audience) Bull! Bull! Bull!

736
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:08,472
I drive truck,
break arms and arm wrestle.

737
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:11,266
It's what I love to do,
it's what I do best.

738
01:06:13,019 --> 01:06:15,437
(announcer) Bull, ladies and gentlemen,

739
01:06:15,605 --> 01:06:19,942
trying for an unprecedented
sixth championship title.

740
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:23,195
Being number one is everything.
There is no second place.

741
01:06:23,363 --> 01:06:25,531
Second sucks.

742
01:06:25,699 --> 01:06:29,284
(announcer) And now, semifinalists,
will you please take the tables?

743
01:06:29,452 --> 01:06:31,996
This is a double elimination
tournament.

744
01:06:32,163 --> 01:06:34,415
Two losses and you're out.

745
01:06:34,582 --> 01:06:36,166
Yeah, John! Come on!

746
01:06:36,334 --> 01:06:38,836
(announcer) All right, gentlemen.
Let's start the competition.

747
01:06:39,004 --> 01:06:40,504
Good luck.

748
01:06:41,297 --> 01:06:44,258
We have Linc Hawk
and John Grizzly competing.

749
01:06:44,426 --> 01:06:46,969
- Get him off my thumb.
- (announcer) This'll be a tough match.

750
01:06:47,137 --> 01:06:49,013
Get him off my thumb.

751
01:06:51,933 --> 01:06:55,185
(man) Hey, what the hell
is that kid doing there?

752
01:06:57,814 --> 01:07:00,691
(announcer) There are two
basic styles...

753
01:07:00,859 --> 01:07:04,403
- He's still got my thumb.
- His thumb's OK.

754
01:07:04,571 --> 01:07:06,739
Ready? Go!

755
01:07:09,743 --> 01:07:11,410
Watch your position!

756
01:07:22,213 --> 01:07:24,923
- (man) Winner, Harry Bosco!
- Winner, Harry Bosco!

757
01:07:26,593 --> 01:07:28,302
Winner!

758
01:07:29,637 --> 01:07:33,432
(announcer) On table number two,
Lincoln Hawk and John Grizzly!

759
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:37,061
This should be a tough match.
Grizzly's getting him over the top.

760
01:07:37,228 --> 01:07:40,689
Grizzly looks like
he's got Linc Hawk in trouble.

761
01:08:32,492 --> 01:08:34,409
(audience cheering)

762
01:08:34,577 --> 01:08:38,122
(announcer) John Grizzly is our winner.
Grizzly has won again.

763
01:08:38,289 --> 01:08:41,959
And the newcomer, Lincoln Hawk,
has lost his first finals match.

764
01:08:42,127 --> 01:08:46,171
Remember, ladies and gentlemen.
This is a double elimination.

765
01:08:46,339 --> 01:08:49,341
Each of these semifinalists
have another chance.

766
01:08:49,509 --> 01:08:53,137
You have to lose twice
to be out of the competition.

767
01:08:53,304 --> 01:08:55,430
(all shouting)

768
01:09:00,645 --> 01:09:03,772
Get him up to my suite.
I wanna talk to him.

769
01:09:04,899 --> 01:09:08,110
Yeah. A little harder.

770
01:09:09,154 --> 01:09:11,905
I hope I didn't tear anything.

771
01:09:13,533 --> 01:09:16,243
Yeah, that's better.

772
01:09:18,830 --> 01:09:20,831
- Hawk?
- What do you want?

773
01:09:20,999 --> 01:09:23,041
Mr. Cutler wants a word with you.

774
01:09:23,209 --> 01:09:26,336
He's waiting
in the presidential suite.

775
01:09:27,714 --> 01:09:29,131
- Ed?
- (Ed) Yeah.

776
01:09:29,299 --> 01:09:32,801
- How long before I go on again?
- You got about a half-hour.

777
01:09:32,969 --> 01:09:35,262
I'll be there.

778
01:09:46,107 --> 01:09:48,400
Come in, Hawk.

779
01:09:51,029 --> 01:09:55,199
You want a drink?
You don't have to stay sharp.

780
01:09:55,366 --> 01:09:58,911
I understand you already
lost your first match.

781
01:09:59,078 --> 01:10:04,917
- What do you want, Cutler?
- We don't have to be enemies.

782
01:10:06,377 --> 01:10:09,171
I never wanted to be your enemy.

783
01:10:09,339 --> 01:10:12,633
All right, then.
Let's get right to it.

784
01:10:14,344 --> 01:10:17,262
With Christina gone...

785
01:10:18,514 --> 01:10:22,517
I have no family left in my life,
except for Michael.

786
01:10:23,519 --> 01:10:26,730
You never had anything,
so you have nothing to lose.

787
01:10:28,566 --> 01:10:32,069
Hawk, you can believe
what you want to.

788
01:10:32,237 --> 01:10:36,365
You're a deserter, plain and simple.
You deserted your wife and your son.

789
01:10:36,532 --> 01:10:38,700
You were tearing us apart.

790
01:10:38,868 --> 01:10:42,537
Don't try to clear your conscience
at my expense.

791
01:10:42,705 --> 01:10:45,791
You're a liar. You deserted them.

792
01:10:48,211 --> 01:10:52,130
- Are you finished?
- I'm not through with you yet.

793
01:10:52,298 --> 01:10:55,467
Come on outside.
I want to show you something.

794
01:10:55,635 --> 01:10:57,302
Come on!

795
01:11:10,942 --> 01:11:14,486
Down there in the parking lot
in front of the hotel.

796
01:11:14,654 --> 01:11:17,364
That's the finest rig
that money can buy.

797
01:11:17,532 --> 01:11:19,574
If you want it, it's yours.

798
01:11:19,742 --> 01:11:22,452
Here's a check for $500,000.

799
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:26,540
- Take it and get out of my life.
- What are you trying to do?

800
01:11:26,708 --> 01:11:30,085
I gave you custody of the boy.
What more do you want?

801
01:11:30,253 --> 01:11:32,212
I'm making things easy for you.

802
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:35,340
You don't need Michael
as a meaI ticket anymore.

803
01:11:35,508 --> 01:11:37,342
So take the truck, take the money.

804
01:11:37,510 --> 01:11:40,095
Start a new life.
Start your own family!

805
01:11:40,263 --> 01:11:42,973
I got a family.

806
01:11:43,141 --> 01:11:46,560
When this is over,
I'm coming to get him.

807
01:11:47,812 --> 01:11:50,355
You're going back on your word.

808
01:11:52,066 --> 01:11:54,109
- Yeah.
- You signed over custody.

809
01:11:54,277 --> 01:11:56,862
He'll never go with you
because you're a loser.

810
01:11:57,030 --> 01:11:59,031
You've always been a loser!

811
01:12:01,451 --> 01:12:05,829
- Mr. Cutler is talking to you.
- I'm through talking.

812
01:12:21,054 --> 01:12:25,140
We continue
with our semifinal series of matches.

813
01:12:25,308 --> 01:12:26,933
You're mine.

814
01:12:27,101 --> 01:12:29,519
(announcer) This is a
double elimination tournament.

815
01:12:29,687 --> 01:12:33,106
Any competitor who loses twice out
of the eight on these four tables...

816
01:12:33,274 --> 01:12:36,568
I'm going through you
like gas through a funnel.

817
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:48,747
You're mine, mister. (grunts)

818
01:12:48,956 --> 01:12:52,959
- Get him off of my thumb.
- Keep your elbow in the cup!

819
01:12:53,127 --> 01:12:55,754
- I don't see it.
- Put your elbow in the cup!

820
01:12:55,922 --> 01:12:58,006
I don't see it.

821
01:12:58,174 --> 01:12:59,758
Ready?

822
01:12:59,926 --> 01:13:01,009
Go!

823
01:13:09,143 --> 01:13:10,727
(yells)

824
01:13:18,403 --> 01:13:21,321
(cheering)

825
01:13:26,452 --> 01:13:32,082
(announcer) Mad Dog Madison will be
the next opponent for Linc Hawk.

826
01:13:35,336 --> 01:13:40,674
Bull Hurley has beaten Harry Bosco
and goes on to the finals.

827
01:13:43,302 --> 01:13:47,681
CarI Adams is our winner.
CarI Adams goes on to the finals.

828
01:13:53,229 --> 01:13:57,691
We're ready for the last matches
of the semifinal series.

829
01:13:57,859 --> 01:13:59,943
The winners go on to the finals.

830
01:14:00,111 --> 01:14:02,821
Over here, we have Mad Dog Madison...

831
01:14:02,989 --> 01:14:05,073
(yells)

832
01:14:15,126 --> 01:14:16,585
Come on! Come on!

833
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:22,591
Winner, Lincoln Hawk!

834
01:14:23,759 --> 01:14:26,636
(announcer) Linc Hawk
has beaten Mad Dog Madison!

835
01:14:26,804 --> 01:14:30,515
And Linc Hawk goes on to the finals.

836
01:14:30,725 --> 01:14:32,559
(man) Next cab. Move it up.

837
01:14:36,898 --> 01:14:40,775
(announcer) We're approaching
the most important event

838
01:14:40,943 --> 01:14:44,696
of this unique and exciting
competition: the final phase.

839
01:14:44,864 --> 01:14:47,616
In the world of arm wrestling
we call this "Over the top".

840
01:14:49,118 --> 01:14:51,703
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's bring on our four finalists.

841
01:14:51,871 --> 01:14:55,874
Our first finalist,
from Jacksonville, Florida,

842
01:14:56,042 --> 01:15:00,295
undefeated in five years.
Let's bring him on. Bull Hurley!

843
01:15:12,642 --> 01:15:15,519
(audience) Bull! Bull! Bull!

844
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:19,773
(announcer) His opponent,
two-time Canadian champion,

845
01:15:19,982 --> 01:15:22,150
Slammin' CarI Adams!

846
01:15:25,905 --> 01:15:29,950
From Boston,
pride of the teamsters, Harry Bosco.

847
01:15:33,162 --> 01:15:34,704
(whistles)

848
01:15:35,373 --> 01:15:39,292
And finally, the newcomer
from the independent truckers,

849
01:15:39,460 --> 01:15:40,835
Lincoln Hawk!

850
01:15:41,003 --> 01:15:43,505
(cheering)

851
01:15:54,433 --> 01:15:55,934
Whoo!

852
01:15:56,352 --> 01:15:58,186
(announcer) Ladies and gentlemen,

853
01:15:58,354 --> 01:16:01,648
let's give our four finalists
a big round of applause!

854
01:16:03,484 --> 01:16:06,486
- I can't lose, Hawk.
- (referee) Shut up!

855
01:16:06,654 --> 01:16:09,573
- Say it.
- (referee) Get your elbows down.

856
01:16:09,782 --> 01:16:13,785
I can't lose. Come on, let's go.
I can't lose, Hawk.

857
01:16:13,953 --> 01:16:15,704
(announcer) Hawk is trying to stay calm,

858
01:16:15,871 --> 01:16:20,000
but inside you know
he has to be boiling. Look at him!

859
01:16:20,209 --> 01:16:24,754
A lot of talking
to the referee going on, too.

860
01:16:24,922 --> 01:16:27,507
Dad, over here!

861
01:16:31,012 --> 01:16:32,596
Dad! Go, Dad!

862
01:16:32,763 --> 01:16:34,639
- First you, then Hurley.
- That's two fouls!

863
01:16:34,807 --> 01:16:38,268
- I'm psyching up the son of a bitch.
- Get your elbow in there!

864
01:16:38,436 --> 01:16:40,895
- Dad!
- Michael, come with me.

865
01:16:41,063 --> 01:16:46,067
Come here, Michael!
Come here! Stop! Come back.

866
01:16:46,277 --> 01:16:48,778
Ready? Go!

867
01:16:52,867 --> 01:16:54,117
(announcer) He wears him out.

868
01:16:54,327 --> 01:16:56,494
OK, ladies and gentlemen.

869
01:16:56,662 --> 01:17:00,040
Bull Hurley and CarI Adams
going at it right over there.

870
01:17:00,249 --> 01:17:02,459
Come on, man!

871
01:17:05,421 --> 01:17:07,088
Get your shoulders square.

872
01:17:07,298 --> 01:17:09,466
I'm not gonna start
until we got it squared.

873
01:17:09,675 --> 01:17:12,344
Lock it back. Ready? Go!

874
01:17:13,054 --> 01:17:15,347
Winner: Lincoln Hawk!

875
01:17:16,349 --> 01:17:20,393
- I wasn't ready yet!
- It was fair! You lost!

876
01:17:20,603 --> 01:17:22,145
Man, I wasn't ready!

877
01:17:22,313 --> 01:17:24,939
Hey, I've been cheated!
I wasn't ready, I said!

878
01:17:25,691 --> 01:17:27,442
Set it off, man!

879
01:17:28,611 --> 01:17:30,195
(grunting)

880
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:38,745
(announcer) Bull Hurley goes on to the
final match of the competition.

881
01:17:50,716 --> 01:17:52,717
Dad!

882
01:17:52,927 --> 01:17:54,803
- Dad!
- Mike.

883
01:17:54,970 --> 01:17:57,013
- What are you doing here?
- Hi, Dad.

884
01:17:57,181 --> 01:18:00,225
- I had to see you.
- How'd you get here?

885
01:18:00,393 --> 01:18:02,519
Dad,
it's a long story, but...

886
01:18:02,687 --> 01:18:05,105
Listen, I want to stay with you.

887
01:18:06,524 --> 01:18:09,484
- Mike, do you?
- Yeah.

888
01:18:09,652 --> 01:18:11,444
I want you to stay, too,

889
01:18:11,612 --> 01:18:15,615
but I don't think your grandfather
is gonna let that happen.

890
01:18:15,783 --> 01:18:18,159
But I want to be with you, Dad.

891
01:18:19,203 --> 01:18:21,579
I want to be with you too,
but, Mike...

892
01:18:21,747 --> 01:18:24,457
I don't have any money.
I sold the truck.

893
01:18:25,376 --> 01:18:28,378
That's OK. You're going to win
like you said, remember?

894
01:18:28,546 --> 01:18:32,507
You'll win that big old truck
and you can start your own business.

895
01:18:36,011 --> 01:18:40,849
Mike, in this last match
I think I pulled a little too hard.

896
01:18:42,935 --> 01:18:46,438
And this guy I'm going against,
Bull Hurley,

897
01:18:46,605 --> 01:18:49,774
he hasn't lost
in about five years and...

898
01:18:49,984 --> 01:18:54,946
I don't know, he's good, Mike.
He's real good and...

899
01:18:56,866 --> 01:18:58,700
I just don't know.

900
01:19:02,371 --> 01:19:05,039
Are you saying you're gonna lose?

901
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:08,418
I might.

902
01:19:14,091 --> 01:19:15,925
I don't believe this.

903
01:19:16,093 --> 01:19:20,764
All that talk about never giving up
was all lies. You never believed it.

904
01:19:20,931 --> 01:19:22,807
And what you said to me, remember?

905
01:19:23,017 --> 01:19:25,059
Now is the time to do it
for yourself.

906
01:19:25,269 --> 01:19:29,105
The world meets nobody halfway.
If you want it, you take it.

907
01:19:29,315 --> 01:19:33,109
You weren't talking about me,
you were talking about yourself.

908
01:19:33,277 --> 01:19:34,652
Mike, please.

909
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:36,821
Now is your chance,
Dad, don't you see?

910
01:19:36,989 --> 01:19:38,948
I don't care about
what happened before,

911
01:19:39,116 --> 01:19:41,284
so stop trying to prove yourself.

912
01:19:41,452 --> 01:19:44,078
It doesn't matter
if you win or lose, Dad.

913
01:19:44,246 --> 01:19:46,956
I don't care about that.

914
01:19:47,124 --> 01:19:50,585
All I care
about is being with you, Dad.

915
01:19:51,712 --> 01:19:55,799
- I love you.
- I love you too, Mike.

916
01:19:58,385 --> 01:20:00,595
We'll try, OK?

917
01:20:02,389 --> 01:20:04,849
That's a big guy.

918
01:20:05,017 --> 01:20:07,268
Well, so are you.

919
01:20:07,436 --> 01:20:09,062
(announcer) Ladies and gentlemen,
the final match.

920
01:20:11,774 --> 01:20:14,359
(cheering)

921
01:20:15,402 --> 01:20:20,073
The referees from the International
Arm Wrestling Council.

922
01:20:24,036 --> 01:20:27,038
The finalist,
undefeated in five years,

923
01:20:27,206 --> 01:20:30,583
five-time world champion,
Bull Hurley.

924
01:20:35,172 --> 01:20:39,425
And, ladies and gentlemen,
the sole remaining challenger,

925
01:20:39,593 --> 01:20:43,930
Lincoln Hawk, the man who
has surprised everybody here today.

926
01:20:44,098 --> 01:20:46,349
If you want it, you gotta take it.

927
01:20:52,231 --> 01:20:54,357
(announcer) The challenger
and the champion.

928
01:20:54,525 --> 01:20:57,110
- You're mine!
- Bull Hurley and Lincoln Hawk.

929
01:20:57,278 --> 01:21:00,572
Or should we say David and Goliath?

930
01:21:00,739 --> 01:21:04,033
The winner here tonight
will walk out with the world cup,

931
01:21:04,201 --> 01:21:08,162
a $250,000 truck
from the Volvo White company,

932
01:21:08,330 --> 01:21:14,961
$100,000 in cash, and the title
of arm wrestling world champion.

933
01:21:15,129 --> 01:21:17,672
He doesn't belong
on my arm wrestling table.

934
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:20,383
That's my area, that's my game.

935
01:21:20,551 --> 01:21:23,094
He's got no shittin' business there.

936
01:21:23,262 --> 01:21:26,639
(announcer) Our two finalists are now
psyching each other out.

937
01:21:26,807 --> 01:21:30,393
Linc Hawk's giving away just
about 100 pounds to Bull Hurley.

938
01:21:30,561 --> 01:21:33,187
That's a lot to give away
in arm wrestling.

939
01:21:33,355 --> 01:21:36,190
- You're mine.
- Let's go.

940
01:21:36,358 --> 01:21:40,361
(announcer) Let the competition begin.
May the best man win!

941
01:21:40,529 --> 01:21:42,363
Come on, chicken shit.

942
01:21:42,531 --> 01:21:45,950
(referee) Place your elbows here.
Hawk, you too.

943
01:21:46,118 --> 01:21:50,330
What I do is, I just try to take
my hat and I turn it around,

944
01:21:50,497 --> 01:21:53,416
and it's like a switch that goes on.

945
01:21:53,584 --> 01:21:57,462
And when the switch goes on,
I feel like another person, I feel...

946
01:21:57,630 --> 01:21:59,881
I don't know, I feeI like a...

947
01:22:00,925 --> 01:22:03,593
Like a truck, like a machine.

948
01:22:03,761 --> 01:22:07,597
I own you.
You've been ducking me for years.

949
01:22:07,765 --> 01:22:10,475
You've got no chance. You know that?

950
01:22:10,643 --> 01:22:13,686
- Hawk, back in here now.
- Don't let him psych you!

951
01:22:13,854 --> 01:22:16,814
Remember what you told me.
You can do it. I know!

952
01:22:16,982 --> 01:22:20,610
- Get in here! Come on!
- (referee) Square up the shoulder.

953
01:22:20,778 --> 01:22:24,238
You got no power, Hawk.
You got no power.

954
01:22:24,406 --> 01:22:27,700
I'm gonna give you
a world of hurt, little man.

955
01:22:27,868 --> 01:22:31,955
And all I want to do is hurt him,
cripple him, get him off the table,

956
01:22:32,122 --> 01:22:36,000
and so he never dares
try to compete against me again.

957
01:22:36,168 --> 01:22:38,544
Ready? Go!

958
01:22:38,712 --> 01:22:39,879
Get him, Dad!

959
01:22:42,174 --> 01:22:43,424
Down! Down!

960
01:22:49,223 --> 01:22:50,390
Way to go!

961
01:22:52,685 --> 01:22:55,269
Pull it! Pull it, Dad! Over the top!

962
01:22:55,437 --> 01:22:59,190
- He's letting go.
- No, he's not.

963
01:22:59,358 --> 01:23:02,902
- He's letting go!
- No, he's not.

964
01:23:03,070 --> 01:23:04,487
Go! Go! Get him!

965
01:23:04,655 --> 01:23:05,863
Hawk!

966
01:23:06,573 --> 01:23:08,616
- He let go!
- Take your hands away.

967
01:23:08,784 --> 01:23:09,951
You asshole!

968
01:23:10,119 --> 01:23:13,830
- You touch the referee once more.
- You don't know what you can do.

969
01:23:13,998 --> 01:23:17,250
You're mine.
Can't you understand that?

970
01:23:17,418 --> 01:23:19,377
You're mine, asshole!

971
01:23:20,421 --> 01:23:23,339
When the two arms come apart,
the strap will be put on.

972
01:23:23,507 --> 01:23:27,093
- Put your elbows down.
- I'll rip your shittin' arm off.

973
01:23:27,261 --> 01:23:29,012
(announcer) They won't be able
to slip after this.

974
01:23:29,179 --> 01:23:30,471
I own you!

975
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:32,890
(referee) Open your thumbs.

976
01:23:33,058 --> 01:23:37,020
Michael, we're going home
as soon as this is over.

977
01:23:37,187 --> 01:23:43,192
Dad, come on, you've got to win.
You can do it, I know you can.

978
01:23:43,402 --> 01:23:45,945
You're a chicken shit.

979
01:23:46,113 --> 01:23:50,533
- You can't get away from me now.
- That's two fouls!

980
01:23:50,701 --> 01:23:53,453
You all right?

981
01:23:53,620 --> 01:23:55,663
Your nose hurt, Hawk?

982
01:23:55,831 --> 01:23:59,667
Dad, come on, take him.
Over the top, Dad! Over the top.

983
01:23:59,835 --> 01:24:02,628
Get in here. Come on!

984
01:24:02,796 --> 01:24:03,880
Ready? Go!

985
01:24:06,091 --> 01:24:08,342
You ain't shit!

986
01:24:09,470 --> 01:24:13,514
Oh, what a move by Bull Hurley!
He has Linc Hawk over the line.

987
01:24:13,682 --> 01:24:16,100
Linc Hawk is in trouble,
in big trouble.

988
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:22,440
He's going down!
I'll break his shittin' arm!

989
01:24:22,608 --> 01:24:26,194
- Come on, Dad!
- (announcer) He's coming back!

990
01:24:27,071 --> 01:24:29,280
This match is unbelievable.

991
01:24:32,826 --> 01:24:36,829
You're nothing, I tell you!
You ain't nothing!

992
01:24:36,997 --> 01:24:38,289
Dad!

993
01:24:38,957 --> 01:24:41,292
(announcer) Bull Hurley
with a great move!

994
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:42,376
Move it!

995
01:24:44,171 --> 01:24:45,713
(announcer) It looks like Hawk
is in big trouble.

996
01:24:45,881 --> 01:24:48,549
Bull Hurley looks like he's got him.

997
01:24:48,717 --> 01:24:51,302
It looks like
Hawk's strength is going.

998
01:24:51,470 --> 01:24:55,681
- (grunts) I own you!
- Dad!

999
01:24:57,810 --> 01:24:59,644
Dad, get him!

1000
01:25:01,647 --> 01:25:05,817

Linc Hawk's making a comeback.

1001
01:25:07,486 --> 01:25:09,362
It looks dead even right now.

1002
01:25:09,530 --> 01:25:11,906
This match has been going on
for over a minute.

1003
01:25:12,116 --> 01:25:14,242
What a match this is.

1004
01:25:14,409 --> 01:25:17,787
It's all gonna boil down
to who wants it most.

1005
01:25:22,042 --> 01:25:23,292
Dad, yeah.

1006
01:25:24,545 --> 01:25:28,965
Maybe Bull Hurley's just too strong.
Maybe he's just too strong.

1007
01:25:29,174 --> 01:25:31,801
It looks like Hawk's
in big trouble right now.

1008
01:25:32,010 --> 01:25:34,554
Bull Hurley looks like he's got him.

(yells)

1010

- Go, Bull!
- Get him!

1011
01:26:01,498 --> 01:26:02,540
Come on!

1012
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:04,625
Come on!

Go! Go! Go!

1014
01:26:12,342 --> 01:26:14,635
(announcer) And now it's dead even.
What a match!

1015
01:26:14,803 --> 01:26:16,053
Yeah!

01:26:38,327 --> 01:26:40,244
Winner!

(announcer) The new world champion.
Hawk is the new champion!

1019

Champion of the world,
ladies and gentlemen!

1020
01:26:51,757 --> 01:26:55,134
Incredible! Unbelievable!

1021
01:26:58,889 --> 01:27:00,223
The world champion has been defeated.

1022
01:27:00,390 --> 01:27:03,517
We have a new world champion:
Linc Hawk!

1023
01:27:03,685 --> 01:27:06,604
A new world champion.
This is unbelievable!

1024
01:27:08,982 --> 01:27:10,858
A challenger out of nowhere.

1025
01:27:11,026 --> 01:27:13,861
Nobody ever thought
he'd have a chance to win.

1026
01:27:14,029 --> 01:27:16,155
We have a new world champion!

Bull Hurley has been defeated!

Out of nowhere, the challenger,
the winner, Linc Hawk.

1030
01:27:28,335 --> 01:27:31,087
This is unbelievable!

1031
01:27:38,887 --> 01:27:41,055
- All right!
- Yeah!

1032
01:28:15,382 --> 01:28:18,259
Why don't we start
our own trucking company?

1033
01:28:18,427 --> 01:28:21,304
We could call it "Son and Hawk".

1034
01:28:22,347 --> 01:28:24,598
- Son and Hawk.
- I like it.

1035
01:28:24,766 --> 01:28:26,809
That's not too bad.

1036
01:28:26,977 --> 01:28:31,230
But how do you think
"Hawk and Son" sounds?

1037
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:34,191
- Hawk and Son?
- What do you think of that?

1038
01:28:34,359 --> 01:28:36,694
Hawk and Son.

1039
