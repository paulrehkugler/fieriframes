1
00:00:02,054 --> 00:00:05,023
<i>It all started when a time
travel experiment I was conducting... </i>

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:08,025
<i>went... a little caca. </i>

3
00:00:08,093 --> 00:00:11,585
<i>In the blink of a cosmic
clock, I went from quantum physicist, </i>

4
00:00:11,663 --> 00:00:15,030
<i>to air force test pilot, </i>

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,830
<i>which could have been
fun if I knew how to fly. </i>

6
00:00:17,903 --> 00:00:21,168
<i>Fortunately, I had help, an
observer from the project named Al. </i>

7
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:25,266
<i>Unfortunately, Al's a hologram, so
all he can lend is moral support. </i>

8
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:28,336
<i>Anyway, here I am, bouncing
around in time, </i>

9
00:00:28,413 --> 00:00:30,506
<i>putting things right that once went wrong, </i>

10
00:00:30,582 --> 00:00:34,450
<i>a sort of time-traveling Lone
Ranger with Al as my Tonto, </i>

11
00:00:34,519 --> 00:00:37,044
<i>and I don't even need a mask. </i>

12
00:00:38,056 --> 00:00:39,990
Oh, boy.

13
00:01:56,301 --> 00:01:59,236
<i>The trouble with quantum
leaping is that just about the time... </i>

14
00:01:59,304 --> 00:02:01,829
<i>I start to enjoy being a hero, </i>

15
00:02:01,907 --> 00:02:05,434
<i>the big guy with the remote control
switches channels on me. </i>

16
00:02:20,425 --> 00:02:23,861
<i>Now all I have to do is
figure out who I am... </i>

17
00:02:23,929 --> 00:02:25,863
<i>where I am, </i>

18
00:02:25,931 --> 00:02:28,923
<i>and why all these young
women are staring at me... </i>

19
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,458
<i>as if I were Tom Cruise. </i>

20
00:02:32,537 --> 00:02:34,971
- Where, Where was I?
- You were explaining...

21
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,406
Heathcliff's obsession with Catherine.

22
00:02:38,543 --> 00:02:41,478
Right. Right, right.

23
00:02:41,546 --> 00:02:46,540
Heathcliff's obsession, uh, with Catherine...

24
00:02:46,618 --> 00:02:49,746
in, uh, uh,

25
00:02:50,956 --> 00:02:53,356
Oh. Wuthering Heights, of course.

26
00:02:53,425 --> 00:02:57,054
Dr. Bryant, do you
think Heathcliff's obsession...

27
00:02:57,129 --> 00:03:02,032
stems from Brontes own tragic
yearning for Bramwell?

28
00:03:03,235 --> 00:03:07,365
I think the woman was
sexually suppressed. Far out, man.

29
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,341
You think she wrote this because
she was horny? Right on!

30
00:03:13,912 --> 00:03:16,847
Great. Four of my least favorite clichés.

31
00:03:16,915 --> 00:03:20,146
Headbands, bell bottoms, flower
power and English Lit.

32
00:03:20,218 --> 00:03:23,051
What do you think, Dr. Bryant?

33
00:03:24,589 --> 00:03:27,752
Uh, well, I-I,

34
00:03:30,262 --> 00:03:34,028
It's an interesting and,
and a difficult question.

35
00:03:36,268 --> 00:03:39,169
Uh, and one we'll have
to discuss tomorrow. No way.

36
00:03:39,237 --> 00:03:41,398
No Friday classes in summer school.

37
00:03:41,473 --> 00:03:43,737
Right? Oh, yes. Uh,

38
00:04:19,477 --> 00:04:21,945
Dr. Bryant. ! Dr. Bryant. !

39
00:04:22,013 --> 00:04:26,541
Oh. I've been trying to get a moment
alone with you all afternoon.

40
00:04:26,618 --> 00:04:30,019
Uh, uh, Jamie-Lee, um,

41
00:04:30,088 --> 00:04:32,352
W
- what can I do for you?

42
00:04:32,424 --> 00:04:35,120
"Give me life, my darling.

43
00:04:36,928 --> 00:04:40,591
Touch my hand and light my soul. "

44
00:04:43,268 --> 00:04:45,532
- Keats?
- No.

45
00:04:45,604 --> 00:04:48,266
Your lecture on expressing love.

46
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:52,777
My, I wanna go home.

47
00:04:52,844 --> 00:04:55,074
You live this way.

48
00:04:56,381 --> 00:04:58,713
Jamie-Lee, um,

49
00:04:58,783 --> 00:05:04,153
I'm a teacher and you're a
student, so no fraternizing.

50
00:05:04,222 --> 00:05:07,487
That's not what you said last night.

51
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:09,652
I didn't? No.

52
00:05:14,065 --> 00:05:15,828
Donna.

53
00:05:17,902 --> 00:05:20,564
Of course. This is Lawrence. !

54
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,199
Where are you going? After,

55
00:05:26,745 --> 00:05:28,679
To the Rathskeller.

56
00:05:28,747 --> 00:05:31,477
They're closed between 4.00
and 6.00 in the summer.

57
00:05:31,549 --> 00:05:35,781
She's going in. Donna Eleese works there.

58
00:05:37,756 --> 00:05:43,285
Jerry, we have to talk. It's
a matter of life and death.

59
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:45,295
I'll put the tea on. Jamie-Lee,

60
00:05:45,363 --> 00:05:48,093
I don't think it's a good
idea for you to be in my rooms.

61
00:05:52,604 --> 00:05:56,131
What's wrong? Everything.

62
00:05:56,207 --> 00:05:59,699
Oh, don't say that.

63
00:05:59,778 --> 00:06:02,178
I know there's a solution.

64
00:06:02,247 --> 00:06:07,378
I believe our love will conquer all, even Daddy.

65
00:06:08,853 --> 00:06:11,344
You gotta be kidding!

66
00:06:11,423 --> 00:06:14,256
No, I'm not.

67
00:06:16,127 --> 00:06:18,391
I did it.

68
00:06:18,463 --> 00:06:21,159
I told Daddy everything.

69
00:06:21,232 --> 00:06:25,168
From that first blush of love...

70
00:06:25,236 --> 00:06:28,637
to that glorious night in the bell tower.

71
00:06:30,909 --> 00:06:35,744
Daddy was furious and threatened to have you
horsewhipped within an inch of your life.

72
00:06:35,814 --> 00:06:38,510
Oscar said he'd kill you with his bare hands.

73
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:43,179
- Oscar?
- A Neanderthal who goes to Ohio State.

74
00:06:45,256 --> 00:06:47,315
He wants to pin me.

75
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,719
Oh, Jerry!

76
00:06:50,795 --> 00:06:52,854
Precious!

77
00:07:06,511 --> 00:07:10,379
It's all so like Romeo and Juliet.

78
00:07:10,448 --> 00:07:12,473
Great. Men wanna horsewhip and kill me,

79
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,643
and you're playing Juliet.

80
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,588
Juliet committed suicide. Suicide?

81
00:07:19,657 --> 00:07:23,218
Oh, yes!

82
00:07:23,294 --> 00:07:26,127
Of course!

83
00:07:26,197 --> 00:07:28,131
A love pact!

84
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,565
Sam, we don't want that to happen, do we?

85
00:07:30,635 --> 00:07:34,833
No. Uh, Jamie-Lee,

86
00:07:34,906 --> 00:07:37,500
we are not committing suicide.

87
00:07:37,575 --> 00:07:40,169
What else is there to do?

88
00:07:44,516 --> 00:07:46,507
Have a cup of tea.

89
00:07:49,921 --> 00:07:53,084
Precisely what Jane and Edward would have done.

90
00:07:56,594 --> 00:07:58,926
Jane and Edward?

91
00:07:58,997 --> 00:08:02,262
Oh, uh, Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester.

92
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:05,029
Charlotte Brontes star-crossed lovers.

93
00:08:06,471 --> 00:08:09,235
How can you teach English literature
if you don't know that?

94
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:13,636
But, anyway, we're gonna get
you out of this one quick this time.

95
00:08:13,711 --> 00:08:16,805
Ziggy figures a 99. 5% chance
- I don't want out of this one quick.

96
00:08:16,881 --> 00:08:18,815
you'll be able to leap when, What?

97
00:08:18,883 --> 00:08:22,148
Hark, my sweetie pie.

98
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,654
Jamie-Lee, I want you to take this cup of tea...

99
00:08:24,722 --> 00:08:26,656
and go straight back to your dorm.

100
00:08:26,724 --> 00:08:28,658
You call your father and Oswald
- Oscar.

101
00:08:28,726 --> 00:08:30,660
Whatever. Tell them it was all a joke.

102
00:08:30,728 --> 00:08:33,822
You made it up because you missed them
and wanted to get their attention.

103
00:08:33,898 --> 00:08:36,332
But it's not a joke.

104
00:08:36,401 --> 00:08:39,165
Ohhh. Oh, yes, it is.

105
00:08:40,238 --> 00:08:42,331
It's the school, isn't it?

106
00:08:42,407 --> 00:08:44,841
You're afraid of losing your tenure.

107
00:08:44,909 --> 00:08:46,843
I'm afraid of losing my life.

108
00:08:46,911 --> 00:08:50,847
If it comes to that, so be it.

109
00:08:50,915 --> 00:08:55,682
Our love can live without these temporal bodies.

110
00:08:56,688 --> 00:09:00,522
Uh, Romeo and Juliet?

111
00:09:00,592 --> 00:09:03,288
Lancelot and Guinevere.

112
00:09:04,696 --> 00:09:09,133
Uh, Jamie-Lee, we, uh, w-we
can play Lancelot and Guinevere...

113
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,134
some other time.

114
00:09:11,202 --> 00:09:14,296
When, my darling?

115
00:09:14,372 --> 00:09:19,309
When, uh, the-the moon...

116
00:09:19,377 --> 00:09:21,811
has crested over the...

117
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,644
towers of Camelot.

118
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:37,157
"When the moon has crested
over the towers of Camelot?"

119
00:09:37,228 --> 00:09:39,992
I know. It's... You better watch it, Sam.

120
00:09:40,064 --> 00:09:43,158
You're gonna end up marrying her too.

121
00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:46,897
They got married? June 20th, 1972.

122
00:09:46,971 --> 00:09:51,169
Nice little intimate shotgun
wedding, 12-gauge, I think it was.

123
00:09:51,242 --> 00:09:53,176
That's what you're here for...

124
00:09:53,244 --> 00:09:56,179
is to see that those two don't
ruin both their lives.

125
00:09:56,247 --> 00:09:59,011
Of course, there's not much more that
could go wrong with Professor Bryant's.

126
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:02,519
That's not why I'm here. Oh?

127
00:10:02,587 --> 00:10:04,680
I'm here to get a second chance,

128
00:10:04,756 --> 00:10:07,850
before I even get a first one.

129
00:10:07,926 --> 00:10:10,588
You wanna let me in on the joke?

130
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:14,091
Donna Eleese is here.

131
00:10:15,099 --> 00:10:18,000
That's not funny, Sam. But true.

132
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:21,197
Don't you see, Al? I'm here to
get Donna and I a second chance.

133
00:10:21,272 --> 00:10:23,638
You're here to see that Guinevere there...

134
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,642
doesn't make the biggest mistake of her life!

135
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:26,638
How do you know that?

136
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:28,804
Ziggy's got it computed down
to the decimal point!

137
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,212
I don't give a damn what a computer says!

138
00:10:31,282 --> 00:10:33,375
We're talking about the
woman I love and my future.

139
00:10:33,451 --> 00:10:37,217
I'm here. She's here. We've got a second chance.

140
00:10:38,456 --> 00:10:41,254
And no one's gonna stop me from taking it.

141
00:10:41,326 --> 00:10:43,453
Not even you.

142
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:52,243
Sam, you're breaking your own inside trader rule.

143
00:10:52,244 --> 00:10:52,796
What?

144
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,065
Quantum leap rule numero uno.

145
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:58,734
The time traveler shall not take
advantage of his position...

146
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,903
to improve or alter his life.

147
00:11:00,979 --> 00:11:02,913
- I made that rule?
- Yes.

148
00:11:02,981 --> 00:11:07,350
And you swore everyone to a blood oath
of allegiance to it on penalty of death.

149
00:11:07,418 --> 00:11:10,819
- Ah, that's my interpretation.
- If I made the rule, I can rescind it.

150
00:11:10,888 --> 00:11:11,492
So ordered.

151
00:11:11,493 --> 00:11:14,949
Not without committee approval,
and Weitzman will never give it.

152
00:11:15,026 --> 00:11:18,587
Weitzman? Short fat guy, uh, in knickers? Mm.

153
00:11:18,663 --> 00:11:21,154
Tall skinny guy with a stovepipe hat.

154
00:11:21,232 --> 00:11:24,531
He's got at Lincoln fixation
and he also controls the committee,

155
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:27,765
and he wants you declared non compos mentis.

156
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,706
Let him. In case you haven't noticed, Al,

157
00:11:30,775 --> 00:11:34,267
the committee doesn't run
this project or me anymore.

158
00:11:56,968 --> 00:11:59,801
Pretty straight for the '70s.

159
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,669
Of course, this is a Catholic girls' college,

160
00:12:04,075 --> 00:12:06,737
- Look at you.
- Uh, it's psychedelic.

161
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:08,745
It must be the black light or something.

162
00:12:08,813 --> 00:12:11,247
You look like a ghost.

163
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,219
Look. There she is. There's Donna.

164
00:12:15,286 --> 00:12:17,550
Oh, my God. It is her.

165
00:12:17,622 --> 00:12:20,022
Now do you believe me? Donna's here. I'm here.

166
00:12:20,091 --> 00:12:22,855
Fate has put us together again.

167
00:12:22,927 --> 00:12:26,192
When I saw her today, I
couldn't believe it. She's so young.

168
00:12:26,264 --> 00:12:31,258
When we first met, she'd just left the
Star Bright Project and was turning 30.

169
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:35,533
Don't do this, Sam. The
wedding was on the fifth of June...

170
00:12:35,606 --> 00:12:38,700
at Old Mission Chapel.

171
00:12:38,776 --> 00:12:40,937
It was hot and I was sweating,

172
00:12:41,012 --> 00:12:45,108
but, you know, it was more from nerves
than from the heat and then,

173
00:12:47,952 --> 00:12:50,284
Everybody went home, because...

174
00:12:54,092 --> 00:12:56,083
I didn't show up for the wedding.

175
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,890
No. No, you showed up. She didn't.

176
00:12:58,963 --> 00:13:01,124
It had something to do with her father.

177
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:03,292
He didn't die, did he? I wouldn't know.

178
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:07,394
And if I did, I couldn't tell you. I
broke the rules before giving you personal data,

179
00:13:07,472 --> 00:13:10,737
and if I do it again, the committee's threatening
to remove me from the project.

180
00:13:10,808 --> 00:13:14,767
They can't remove you. You're
the only contact they have with me.

181
00:13:14,846 --> 00:13:16,905
Al, I want you to run a,

182
00:13:20,318 --> 00:13:22,343
Chicken.

183
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,526
She smelled the same.

184
00:13:37,602 --> 00:13:39,866
Of course, I didn't.

185
00:13:39,937 --> 00:13:43,507
God, how I wanted to tell her I'm not
the boozed-out professor she sees,

186
00:13:43,508 --> 00:13:44,636
that I was her Sam,

187
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:47,371
the man she'll love 10 years from now,

188
00:13:47,445 --> 00:13:49,379
that I'm doing what we dreamed of,

189
00:13:49,447 --> 00:13:51,415
I'm traveling in time.

190
00:13:51,482 --> 00:13:54,212
What can I get for you, Dr. Bryant?

191
00:13:54,285 --> 00:13:57,652
- Uh, an avion,
Evian. - A what?

192
00:13:57,722 --> 00:14:00,213
Uh, C-Coke. Uh, a Coke would be fine.

193
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,816
A Coke, cheeseburger and
fries, medium rare on the burger,

194
00:14:02,894 --> 00:14:05,761
Hold the tomato, extra onion.

195
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:17,768
She knew. She knew how I liked my burger.

196
00:14:17,842 --> 00:14:20,174
Shove that up your gauge circuit, Ziggy.

197
00:14:23,714 --> 00:14:26,012
Thank you. Uh, Donna,

198
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:29,177
um, could I talk with you?

199
00:14:29,253 --> 00:14:31,346
Oh, I really don't have time, Dr. Bryant.

200
00:14:31,422 --> 00:14:33,652
Oh, yeah. I'll, um, uh,

201
00:14:33,724 --> 00:14:35,988
Maybe, Well, I'll just wait till you finish work.

202
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,086
Dr, Bryant, please, um,

203
00:14:39,163 --> 00:14:41,358
I'm quite capable of
getting an "A" in your class...

204
00:14:41,432 --> 00:14:43,696
by simply doing the work.

205
00:14:43,768 --> 00:14:45,702
No. No. No, no.

206
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:48,204
No, tha-that's, that's not what I'm saying.

207
00:14:48,272 --> 00:14:51,469
Donna, I'm not what I look like.

208
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:53,942
If you look into my eyes, you can see that.

209
00:14:54,946 --> 00:14:58,541
- Is this your best line?
- It's not a line.

210
00:15:00,284 --> 00:15:05,688
If you look into my
eyes, you'll see another soul.

211
00:15:06,891 --> 00:15:10,554
- You've had too much to drink.
- I haven't had a drop.

212
00:15:23,407 --> 00:15:26,843
This is silly. Yeah. So it's silly.

213
00:15:29,914 --> 00:15:32,007
Do it anyway.

214
00:15:40,258 --> 00:15:45,195
Please don't talk to me anymore,
Dr. Bryant. Donna.

215
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:47,520
Hey. ! I thought I told
you to leave my girl alone.

216
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,036
Donna's your girl? Jamie-Lee's my girl.

217
00:15:53,104 --> 00:15:55,038
Oscar.

218
00:15:55,106 --> 00:15:58,371
Yeah, Oscar, and he's here to break your face.

219
00:15:59,443 --> 00:16:04,813
Look, Oscar, why don't we
just talk about this man-to-man?

220
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:08,818
If you don't like what you
hear, you can always break my face.

221
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:14,320
Good. First, Jamie-Lee is crazy about you.

222
00:16:14,392 --> 00:16:18,488
Yeah, right. And that's why all she
can talk about is her precious Jerry.

223
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:22,999
Which... Which proves my point. See, if
she was crazy about me, she'd never mention me.

224
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:26,127
But since she's really crazy about
you, all she does is talk about me.

225
00:16:27,805 --> 00:16:31,571
She's trying to make you jealous.
Well, it's working.

226
00:16:31,642 --> 00:16:33,701
Oscar,

227
00:16:35,413 --> 00:16:37,847
Jamie-Lee once told me that...

228
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:41,851
you were the only man who
ever made the earth move for her.

229
00:16:43,487 --> 00:16:45,478
Yeah? Yeah.

230
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:50,450
That ain't what she told me.

231
00:16:50,528 --> 00:16:53,019
Isn't.

232
00:16:54,098 --> 00:16:57,067
Of course not. See, she's
frustrated with you. She,

233
00:16:58,336 --> 00:17:01,134
She thinks you want her only for her body.

234
00:17:01,205 --> 00:17:04,197
Oh, she's got a great body.

235
00:17:04,275 --> 00:17:06,470
She also has a mind, Oscar.

236
00:17:06,544 --> 00:17:10,310
Oscar. A deeply poetic mind.

237
00:17:10,381 --> 00:17:12,474
And if you want her to love you,

238
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:16,816
you gotta let the romantic side of you free.

239
00:17:16,887 --> 00:17:19,720
Romantic side of me? I-Isn't
Jamie-Lee in your thoughts night and day?

240
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,224
Yeah, except for wrestling practice.

241
00:17:23,894 --> 00:17:26,886
Well, tell her that, but don't mention
the wrestling practice stuff.

242
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:31,958
Take to a romantic movie, a candlelit
dinner, read her a poem.

243
00:17:32,036 --> 00:17:35,164
I did. You did?

244
00:17:38,075 --> 00:17:40,009
There once was a young man from Kent...

245
00:17:40,077 --> 00:17:42,910
- Oscar, limericks aren't
exactly what I had in mind.

246
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,675
Look, read her a romantic poet,

247
00:17:44,749 --> 00:17:47,013
Kelly, Sheets
- Keats. I don't know.

248
00:17:47,084 --> 00:17:49,848
What do you mean you don't know? You're the prof.

249
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,911
I mean, the choice is yours.

250
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:55,186
Tell her how beautiful she is,

251
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:57,784
how her perfume drives you crazy,

252
00:17:57,862 --> 00:18:00,194
how you can't get her eyes out of your mind.

253
00:18:00,264 --> 00:18:04,564
And her lips. How
- How wet and how juicy they are.

254
00:18:04,635 --> 00:18:07,297
Perfect.

255
00:18:07,371 --> 00:18:12,001
That's mush. I can't talk
mush. To guys, it's mush.

256
00:18:12,076 --> 00:18:14,476
To women, it's romantic.

257
00:18:14,545 --> 00:18:17,378
Look, Oscar, Jamie-Lee
doesn't want a broken-down lit prof.

258
00:18:17,448 --> 00:18:20,315
She wants a young football hero
- Wrestling!

259
00:18:20,384 --> 00:18:24,878
Wrestling hero who'll be a little mushy.

260
00:18:26,891 --> 00:18:30,224
Dr. Bryant, I love Jamie-Lee so much...

261
00:18:30,294 --> 00:18:32,626
I'm willing to try anything.

262
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:36,165
But I think you're feeding me a line of crap.

263
00:18:36,233 --> 00:18:41,136
And if this don't work, you can
expect me to be back to break your face.

264
00:18:52,917 --> 00:18:55,477
That might help.

265
00:19:00,257 --> 00:19:03,385
Where's Donna? She wasn't feeling
hot, so she went home.

266
00:19:03,461 --> 00:19:08,125
Did you want tomatoes on this? They didn't put
tomatoes on 'em, but I can get tomatoes for you.

267
00:19:08,199 --> 00:19:11,293
Did you want tomatoes? You know what else?
I was looking at the class schedule,

268
00:19:11,368 --> 00:19:16,135
Muskie has 156 delegates
pledged to him and many endorsements.

269
00:19:16,207 --> 00:19:19,005
Muskie met with McGovern today in Washington.

270
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:22,807
If the party can stand on, it'll
be successful this fall.

271
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,973
But we didn't talk about the
matter of endorsements.

272
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:27,984
Would you like his support before you
go to the convention? I would love it.

273
00:19:30,187 --> 00:19:33,315
The United States Military Command in Saigon...

274
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:36,917
said today that yesterday's air
attacks over North Vietnam were the heaviest,

275
00:19:38,229 --> 00:19:41,665
There was a time when I cared
about politics and the making of history,

276
00:19:41,732 --> 00:19:44,667
but the big picture seemed unimportant...

277
00:19:44,735 --> 00:19:47,329
next to getting a chance for
Donna and I in the future.

278
00:19:50,407 --> 00:19:53,342
Bryant had summed up my feelings with a thought.

279
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:57,506
"Between love and the noblest
cause, there should be no contest.

280
00:19:58,582 --> 00:20:01,346
Love is life's only true satisfaction. "

281
00:20:01,418 --> 00:20:04,751
Yoo-hoo. ! Lancelot. !

282
00:20:07,424 --> 00:20:11,019
The fires burn deep, my knight,

283
00:20:11,095 --> 00:20:14,360
as passion roars within me.

284
00:20:14,431 --> 00:20:19,198
Riddled with guilt, yet desperate for your loins,

285
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:22,398
your Guinevere has arrived!

286
00:20:22,473 --> 00:20:23,872
Oh, boy.

287
00:20:23,941 --> 00:20:26,967
I get the feeling that you brought
this one on yourself.

288
00:20:27,044 --> 00:20:29,342
Where have you been? Waiting...

289
00:20:29,413 --> 00:20:33,008
for the moon to crest over Camelot.

290
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,142
See what I mean?

291
00:20:35,219 --> 00:20:38,711
- You're not dressed.
- I wasn't expecting guests.

292
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:42,657
But you promised to be Lancelot next.

293
00:20:42,726 --> 00:20:44,819
Next?

294
00:20:49,466 --> 00:20:52,594
Sam, there's all kinds of kinky stuff in here. !

295
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:54,900
There's leather stuff. There's a Roman toga.

296
00:20:54,972 --> 00:20:57,907
There's rubber stuff in here. ! Jamie-Lee,

297
00:20:57,975 --> 00:21:01,502
don't you have more
important things to do, like homework?

298
00:21:01,579 --> 00:21:05,071
I'm trying to work on my "A" in English Lit.

299
00:21:05,149 --> 00:21:08,846
Oh, my God. ! Sam, you gotta see this. !

300
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:11,683
Jamie-Lee, you gotta forget about me.

301
00:21:11,755 --> 00:21:14,849
You gotta start thinking
about other men, like, like Oscar.

302
00:21:14,925 --> 00:21:18,861
He's just a boy. That
boy wanted to break my face.

303
00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:22,524
He wanted to defend my honor?

304
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,864
Uh, define "honor"?

305
00:21:24,935 --> 00:21:27,199
Oscar's willing to kill for you.

306
00:21:27,271 --> 00:21:30,206
Don't you think you should
at least give him a chance?

307
00:21:30,274 --> 00:21:32,606
But he's so stiff,

308
00:21:34,445 --> 00:21:36,436
so unromantic.

309
00:21:37,448 --> 00:21:41,885
Not anymore. I wouldn't be surprised if Oscar
started reading you romantic poetry.

310
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,113
Oscar? Oscar.

311
00:21:46,357 --> 00:21:51,385
Look, believe me,
Jamie-Lee. He's the one for you,

312
00:21:51,462 --> 00:21:53,396
not me.

313
00:21:53,464 --> 00:21:58,401
Ah. You're both young. You got
your whole life in front of you.

314
00:21:58,469 --> 00:22:01,836
Uh, tell her they're both gonna
grow up to be yuppies. Give him a chance.

315
00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:05,341
They're gonna eat pasta and
drive B. M. W's with, uh, fuzzy seats.

316
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:09,004
Well, if you think I should,

317
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:14,243
Al, Donna,

318
00:22:14,318 --> 00:22:17,412
But it won't affect my love for you!

319
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:22,282
Peace.

320
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:30,022
Al, Donna knew how I wanted my cheeseburger.

321
00:22:31,435 --> 00:22:35,269
What? She looked into my eyes,
and she knew it was me.

322
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:41,040
Well, how could she know it was you when
she doesn't meet you for 12 years?

323
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:44,205
We're star-crossed souls. That uncrossed.

324
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:47,717
Well, you know, I've been working
on that, and I think I can fix it.

325
00:22:47,785 --> 00:22:50,720
But I have to locate her father, and I was
- No.

326
00:22:50,788 --> 00:22:54,952
Al. Al, couldn't you
- No. No, no. No! No! I can't help you, Sam.

327
00:22:55,025 --> 00:22:58,051
If I even try, they're gonna pull
the plug, and they're not kidding.

328
00:22:58,128 --> 00:23:00,062
Weitzman is at the foundation right now...

329
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,995
arguing for the authority to do it.

330
00:23:02,066 --> 00:23:05,399
You've broken your rules. You've
broken their rules. You've broken our rules.

331
00:23:05,469 --> 00:23:08,836
You gotta stop thinking with your
heart and start thinking with your noggin.

332
00:23:08,906 --> 00:23:10,840
Is that what you'd do?

333
00:23:10,908 --> 00:23:14,844
If, Hey. If some woman stood me up
at the altar, it's 'Adios, amigos. "

334
00:23:15,913 --> 00:23:19,007
Actually, uh, I wish a couple of them had.

335
00:23:23,921 --> 00:23:26,856
Don't give me that sick puppy look.

336
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:31,685
Stop it. I'll never scratch
you behind the ears again.

337
00:23:31,762 --> 00:23:33,753
Now, stop it.

338
00:23:35,099 --> 00:23:38,193
Donna's father was career military. Shh. No. Sam,

339
00:23:38,268 --> 00:23:41,863
Uh, he was in the army, I think. Sam. Sa... No.

340
00:23:43,107 --> 00:23:44,597
No.

341
00:24:00,124 --> 00:24:03,321
Bunsen burners, there's no other smell like it.

342
00:24:03,394 --> 00:24:07,330
They are the common denominator
that make all science departments equal.

343
00:24:07,398 --> 00:24:11,164
My life's blood, and I'm
trapped in Mr. English Lit.

344
00:24:11,235 --> 00:24:13,226
There's no justice.

345
00:24:43,033 --> 00:24:43,808
Thanks.

346
00:24:43,809 --> 00:24:47,060
You forgot Hubble's
Constant and, uh, the red shift.

347
00:24:47,137 --> 00:24:49,401
Right.

348
00:24:49,473 --> 00:24:53,204
Your calculations are in the right direction.
You're just not applying your astrophysics.

349
00:24:54,645 --> 00:24:56,579
Expanding universe.

350
00:24:56,647 --> 00:24:59,616
Ever read Lemaitre's "Primeval Atom?"

351
00:24:59,683 --> 00:25:01,742
No.

352
00:25:01,819 --> 00:25:05,448
"Then came the explosion, followed by
the filling of the heavens with smoke.

353
00:25:06,723 --> 00:25:09,157
"We come to late to do no more than...

354
00:25:09,226 --> 00:25:11,922
visualize the splendor of creation's birthday. "

355
00:25:11,995 --> 00:25:13,929
It's beautiful.

356
00:25:13,997 --> 00:25:15,988
It's the poetry of physics.

357
00:25:17,067 --> 00:25:19,661
Why do you know so much about this?

358
00:25:19,736 --> 00:25:22,034
Uh, well, I read a lot.

359
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:24,835
Pretty heady reading,

360
00:25:24,908 --> 00:25:28,503
Einstein and Lemaitre, not to mention the math.

361
00:25:28,579 --> 00:25:30,672
What lured you into it?

362
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,445
Guess I just wanna know why things happen to us.

363
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:37,851
Don't you think you have a choice?

364
00:25:37,921 --> 00:25:39,946
Do you?

365
00:25:40,023 --> 00:25:41,957
Well, I used to. I'm not sure anymore.

366
00:25:42,993 --> 00:25:45,359
Well, if we did have a choice,

367
00:25:45,429 --> 00:25:47,693
I sure would've made things
happen a lot differently.

368
00:25:50,801 --> 00:25:52,996
Who knows, maybe I'll go back
in time and change it.

369
00:25:55,806 --> 00:25:58,866
- What, you think that's silly?
- No, no. It...

370
00:26:00,777 --> 00:26:03,337
If you could travel back in
time, when would you go back to?

371
00:26:05,382 --> 00:26:09,011
When I was happiest, maybe
six or seven years old.

372
00:26:09,086 --> 00:26:12,749
- Before your father left you?
- How did you know about that?

373
00:26:15,893 --> 00:26:17,509
I guess somebody told me.

374
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:21,160
Well, nobody could've told you
because I never told anyone.

375
00:26:21,231 --> 00:26:24,667
- Who the hell are you?
- Just a friend.

376
00:26:27,137 --> 00:26:30,834
Look, Donna, it was just a guess. Please.

377
00:26:30,908 --> 00:26:35,504
Please. I noticed you didn't list
a father on your school record,

378
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:37,513
and you went by your mother's maiden name.

379
00:26:37,581 --> 00:26:40,914
- What were you doing in my records?
- You're in my class.

380
00:26:48,592 --> 00:26:50,753
Let's just keep it at that.

381
00:26:51,828 --> 00:26:53,921
I have a string theory on time.

382
00:26:53,997 --> 00:26:59,060
It's very complex and completely improvable,
but I'd like your opinion.

383
00:26:59,136 --> 00:27:03,971
It's based on an expanding but finite universe.
Well, the universe is infinite.

384
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:08,774
Maybe not, and if not, then time is finite too.

385
00:27:08,845 --> 00:27:12,110
- I have to go to the library.
- It's a nice public place.

386
00:27:56,593 --> 00:27:58,686
But only in his own lifetime?

387
00:28:00,097 --> 00:28:02,793
Well, that-that's the way I see it.

388
00:28:02,866 --> 00:28:05,460
Ohhh. I think I'm getting a headache.

389
00:28:05,535 --> 00:28:07,469
Yeah, well, it's kind of a lot to,

390
00:28:07,537 --> 00:28:09,801
Oh, no! Stacy's gonna be here in 10 minutes.

391
00:28:09,873 --> 00:28:11,807
I have to open tonight.

392
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:14,139
I'm sorry, Dr. Bryant. I have kitchen duty.

393
00:28:14,211 --> 00:28:16,202
Well, can we continue this after work?

394
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:19,646
Sure, as long as, It's public. Yeah.

395
00:28:21,718 --> 00:28:23,709
Bye.

396
00:28:25,555 --> 00:28:28,888
You're not giving away any
trade secrets, are you?

397
00:28:30,427 --> 00:28:33,487
- How long have you been there?
- Eh, long enough to know...

398
00:28:33,563 --> 00:28:37,363
that you could still
construct an atomic bomb if you had to.

399
00:28:37,434 --> 00:28:41,234
An atomic bomb? Al.

400
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:44,833
Nothing we discussed...

401
00:28:44,908 --> 00:28:48,344
remotely is connected to nuclear detonation.

402
00:28:48,412 --> 00:28:51,381
Al, I was just trying to,

403
00:28:55,652 --> 00:28:58,849
- You're not alone.
- Nope.

404
00:28:58,922 --> 00:29:04,258
- But they can't hear or see me.
- Thank God for little favors.

405
00:29:04,327 --> 00:29:09,196
- Weitzman and the
committee? - I- I can't help you, Sam.

406
00:29:09,266 --> 00:29:11,200
You got to, Al. Look, I figured it out.

407
00:29:11,268 --> 00:29:14,567
Donna left me at the altar. Did the same thing
to the guy she was engaged to before me.

408
00:29:14,638 --> 00:29:18,540
It's a pattern. When she was 8, her father
left and she's never gotten over it.

409
00:29:18,608 --> 00:29:20,974
Al, she blocked out her own father's name.

410
00:29:21,044 --> 00:29:25,572
Don't you see? Donna's never gonna
risk being hurt by a man like that again.

411
00:29:25,649 --> 00:29:29,483
She's gonna go through life
leaving them before they can leave her.

412
00:29:29,553 --> 00:29:34,923
But... But if I can get Donna
and her father together, who knows?

413
00:29:34,991 --> 00:29:38,518
You know, uh, those six doctorates that you hold,

414
00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:42,020
Not one of them is in psychiatry.

415
00:29:42,099 --> 00:29:47,332
Medicine, yes. Uh, quantum physics, yes.

416
00:29:47,404 --> 00:29:50,032
Ancient languages, yes.

417
00:29:52,142 --> 00:29:55,441
- Ancient languages, yes.
- Yes.

418
00:29:58,882 --> 00:30:01,112
The sash?

419
00:30:01,184 --> 00:30:03,584
Brilliant, Sherlock. Hieroglyphics?

420
00:30:03,653 --> 00:30:05,746
I can read hieroglyphics?

421
00:30:05,822 --> 00:30:09,053
Well, you never know unless you try.

422
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:12,558
It's all just a bunch of pictures to me, Al.

423
00:30:12,629 --> 00:30:15,189
I can't remember what they... That...

424
00:30:15,265 --> 00:30:18,666
That is a the symbol for a capital.

425
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:23,672
Um, what was the ancient capital of
Egypt? Memphis! He's in Memphis!

426
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:26,504
- No, I wouldn't say that, Sam. No.
- Not in Memphis.

427
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:30,910
Um, maybe the capital of Egypt today
- Don't tell me he's in Cairo.

428
00:30:30,981 --> 00:30:32,848
You're being too literal, Sam.

429
00:30:32,883 --> 00:30:35,865
Well, that hieroglyphic is
the symbol for a capital.

430
00:30:35,866 --> 00:30:36,847
Mm.

431
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,311
Um,

432
00:30:40,791 --> 00:30:43,589
Our capital? You're trying to
tell me he's in Washington.

433
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:47,096
Good. Okay. Donna's father is in D. C. ,

434
00:30:47,164 --> 00:30:50,964
and he, um, is still in the army.

435
00:30:51,034 --> 00:30:52,968
That's the symbol for the pharaoh's army.

436
00:30:53,036 --> 00:30:58,201
Sam. Square times five.

437
00:30:58,275 --> 00:31:02,109
- And in the Pentagon!
- Oh, I'd give you one of these if I could.

438
00:31:02,179 --> 00:31:05,012
I need his name, Al.

439
00:31:05,081 --> 00:31:08,346
That's, uh... That's ridiculous.

440
00:31:08,418 --> 00:31:13,185
Uh, Sam, Ziggy is scanning my
side of this conversation,

441
00:31:13,256 --> 00:31:17,056
and he thinks I'm trying to
communicate to you in a code.

442
00:31:19,262 --> 00:31:20,957
What hieroglyphics?

443
00:31:21,031 --> 00:31:26,469
Hey! How can I write
Colonel Wojohowitz in hieroglyphics?

444
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:33,002
Al!

445
00:31:34,211 --> 00:31:36,771
Did you call me, Dr. Bryant?

446
00:31:38,915 --> 00:31:41,247
If I asked you to go to Washington,
would you do it?

447
00:31:42,452 --> 00:31:44,386
Dr. Bryant, I was just getting to like you.

448
00:31:44,454 --> 00:31:46,718
Don't treat me like that. I'm
not treating you like that.

449
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:49,816
If I were 15 years younger or
this was 15 years later, I would,

450
00:31:49,893 --> 00:31:51,827
but I can't now.

451
00:31:51,895 --> 00:31:54,227
Donna, it's important.

452
00:31:54,297 --> 00:31:57,824
Hell, I'll bring a chaperone.

453
00:31:57,901 --> 00:31:59,835
We can be there and back in a day.

454
00:31:59,903 --> 00:32:02,201
To do what?

455
00:32:04,241 --> 00:32:06,766
Save a lost love.

456
00:32:19,589 --> 00:32:22,217
- Colonel Wojohowitz.
- Thank God.

457
00:32:22,292 --> 00:32:25,420
What? Uh, Colonel, you
don't know me. My name is Bryant,

458
00:32:25,495 --> 00:32:27,463
Dr, Gerald Bryant, and I'm on the faculty...

459
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,464
at Lawrence College in Marion, Ohio.

460
00:32:29,532 --> 00:32:31,625
Yes? Uh, I was wondering if I could see you.

461
00:32:31,701 --> 00:32:34,693
Dr. Bryant, I ship out
for Vietnam at 0800 tomorrow.

462
00:32:34,771 --> 00:32:36,705
Vietnam.

463
00:32:36,773 --> 00:32:40,231
I'm sure you've heard of it. Of course. I just...

464
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:42,574
Doctor, I'm very busy. Would
you get to the point?

465
00:32:42,646 --> 00:32:46,082
It's your daughter.

466
00:32:53,456 --> 00:32:55,185
Colonel, are you there?

467
00:32:56,927 --> 00:32:57,916
Yes.

468
00:32:59,796 --> 00:33:03,254
- Do you remember Donna?
- Of course I remember Donna.

469
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:05,301
She needs you, sir.

470
00:33:06,336 --> 00:33:09,794
Is she hurt? No. Uh, not physically.

471
00:33:10,907 --> 00:33:14,502
Colonel, since you're shipping out tomorrow,
I don't have time to be subtle about this.

472
00:33:14,577 --> 00:33:17,512
I don't know why you left your family.
I'm sure you had your reasons.

473
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:20,174
But your leaving and never
contacting her again...

474
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:22,343
has affected Donna's ability to love anyone else.

475
00:33:22,419 --> 00:33:27,755
Dr. Bryant, the breakup with her
mother and I had nothing to do with her.

476
00:33:27,824 --> 00:33:31,726
She doesn't think you love her, that if
you did, you wouldn't have abandoned her.

477
00:33:31,795 --> 00:33:33,956
I love my daughter. I loved her very much.

478
00:33:35,098 --> 00:33:37,032
I'm not going to reopen this wound...

479
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,159
not when I'm shipping out.

480
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:41,715
Maybe when I come back.

481
00:33:41,716 --> 00:33:45,798
Well, forgive me, sir, but, uh,
what if you don't come back?

482
00:33:47,344 --> 00:33:49,403
Good-bye, Dr. Bryant.

483
00:33:52,849 --> 00:33:55,943
Just a damn minute!

484
00:33:58,088 --> 00:34:00,784
Look...

485
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,894
I told you I'd be back.

486
00:34:18,041 --> 00:34:20,305
Okay. All right.

487
00:34:20,377 --> 00:34:22,641
So...

488
00:34:22,712 --> 00:34:24,646
... my advice didn't work.

489
00:34:24,714 --> 00:34:26,648
Right. Right. Right?

490
00:34:26,716 --> 00:34:29,685
What happened? I did what you told me.

491
00:34:29,753 --> 00:34:31,880
I, uh, I read her poetry.

492
00:34:31,955 --> 00:34:35,516
I told her that her perfume made me
horny and that her lips made me even hornier.

493
00:34:35,592 --> 00:34:37,184
I get the idea. And then,

494
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,751
I get the idea! Look, Oscar,

495
00:34:41,264 --> 00:34:43,232
"horny" isn't romantic.

496
00:34:43,299 --> 00:34:45,893
Well, it is to me. Not to Jamie-Lee.

497
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:49,837
To Jamie-Lee,

498
00:34:49,906 --> 00:34:52,374
"breathless with passion"...

499
00:34:52,442 --> 00:34:55,240
... is romantic.

500
00:34:55,311 --> 00:34:57,279
Do you have a car?

501
00:34:58,281 --> 00:35:00,112
O.

502
00:35:00,183 --> 00:35:03,152
Triple deuce, Hurst
four-speed, 3-9-0 rear end, mag wheels.

503
00:35:03,219 --> 00:35:06,620
Uh, will it hold four people?

504
00:35:06,689 --> 00:35:08,782
Maybe. Say, me,

505
00:35:08,858 --> 00:35:12,521
and Donna Eleese and you and Jamie-Lee?

506
00:35:12,595 --> 00:35:14,460
In that order?

507
00:35:14,531 --> 00:35:17,091
Yeah, in that order.

508
00:35:26,676 --> 00:35:29,406
- Did you see him?
- Bang.

509
00:35:29,479 --> 00:35:35,008
You'd shoot that magnificent creature?

510
00:35:35,085 --> 00:35:38,521
It was a buck. Bambi was a buck!

511
00:35:39,589 --> 00:35:41,784
I want to change seats, please.

512
00:35:41,858 --> 00:35:45,191
Jamie-Lee, Romeo hunted deer.

513
00:35:46,362 --> 00:35:48,694
He did? Yes, he did.

514
00:35:48,765 --> 00:35:53,031
- And, uh, as well as...
- Lancelot.

515
00:35:53,103 --> 00:35:57,199
Lancelot. You know, I bet
Lancelot brought Guinevere a deer a week.

516
00:35:58,341 --> 00:36:00,673
And Rochester rode on stag hunts.

517
00:36:00,743 --> 00:36:02,643
That's right.

518
00:36:02,712 --> 00:36:06,808
The first time Blanche came to Thornwood
she rode to the hounds.

519
00:36:09,385 --> 00:36:11,819
Is that how you hunt stag?

520
00:36:13,389 --> 00:36:15,323
Mm, sort a.

521
00:36:19,863 --> 00:36:23,321
And while Lennon read a book on Marx

522
00:36:23,399 --> 00:36:26,835
The quartet practiced in the park

523
00:36:26,903 --> 00:36:30,066
And we sang dirges in the dark

524
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:35,339
The day the music died Fill 'er up?

525
00:36:35,411 --> 00:36:37,845
Yep. Okay.

526
00:36:37,914 --> 00:36:39,848
Where's the bathroom? Uh, back there.

527
00:36:39,916 --> 00:36:42,851
Where's the key? Key? We don't have no key.

528
00:36:53,263 --> 00:36:57,290
Al! Thank God you're here. I thought
I'd never see you again.

529
00:36:57,367 --> 00:36:59,301
I figured that they'd pulled you off the project.

530
00:36:59,369 --> 00:37:03,635
Oh, they did. They fed the
hieroglyphics into Ziggy, and then they fired me.

531
00:37:03,706 --> 00:37:05,799
They can't do that. Tell Weitzman.

532
00:37:05,875 --> 00:37:10,642
But it's unimportant. What's
important is he's had a change of heart.

533
00:37:10,713 --> 00:37:12,374
I didn't think Weitzman had a heart.

534
00:37:12,448 --> 00:37:14,382
He probably doesn't, but his wife does.

535
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:16,290
You slept with his wife?

536
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:20,047
I would never do
anything so unscrupulous as that,

537
00:37:20,123 --> 00:37:22,648
unless it was Bartlett's wife.

538
00:37:22,725 --> 00:37:25,660
Now, there is a woman to get fired over.

539
00:37:26,763 --> 00:37:28,822
Ran into her one time at the fights.

540
00:37:28,898 --> 00:37:32,163
Uh, Barlett was at some, I
don't know, some seminar in Utah.

541
00:37:32,235 --> 00:37:35,170
And it was her birthday, and
you know, the fool forgot.

542
00:37:35,238 --> 00:37:38,605
What happened? Oh, well,
we had a couple of drinks,

543
00:37:38,675 --> 00:37:42,042
a nice rare steak with green chiles
- With Weitzman!

544
00:37:42,111 --> 00:37:44,306
Oh! Weitzman.

545
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,314
You know Tina? Yeah.

546
00:37:46,382 --> 00:37:48,213
Weitzman knows her too.

547
00:37:48,284 --> 00:37:51,913
You set Tina up with
Weitzman and then blackmailed him?

548
00:37:53,256 --> 00:37:55,190
Yeah. That...

549
00:37:55,258 --> 00:37:59,024
Unscrupulous, but effective.

550
00:38:00,597 --> 00:38:04,363
At least you're here. That's
the way I figured it.

551
00:38:04,434 --> 00:38:07,835
Now, I had Ziggy compute the odds...

552
00:38:07,904 --> 00:38:12,568
on your being right about
fixing Donna's hang-up.

553
00:38:13,676 --> 00:38:15,644
Pretty low, huh?

554
00:38:15,712 --> 00:38:18,476
Well, if you get Donna and her father together,

555
00:38:18,548 --> 00:38:23,645
the odds are 4-to-1 that she'll commit
to a relationship in the future.

556
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:28,783
Al, no offense, but this time I'm
gonna make Ziggy my best man.

557
00:38:28,858 --> 00:38:31,656
Wait a minute. You're forgetting something.

558
00:38:31,728 --> 00:38:36,222
What? Well, she was engaged to
someone before she even met you.

559
00:38:36,299 --> 00:38:39,393
Yeah? Yeah, so if you pull this off,

560
00:38:39,469 --> 00:38:41,630
she could marry this other jerk first.

561
00:38:56,986 --> 00:38:59,454
Confession time.

562
00:38:59,522 --> 00:39:01,922
What?

563
00:39:01,991 --> 00:39:06,291
I used to think you wrote your
book just to pick up young, naive coeds.

564
00:39:07,363 --> 00:39:10,399
You really are romantic, aren't you?

565
00:39:10,467 --> 00:39:11,328
Well...

566
00:39:11,439 --> 00:39:14,928
I mean, you’re trying to
get these two back together,

567
00:39:15,004 --> 00:39:18,269
driving 400 miles for the sake of a lost love.

568
00:39:21,044 --> 00:39:24,810
What I don't understand is
why you wanted me here.

569
00:39:25,882 --> 00:39:29,477
You remind me of her. Twelve
years younger, but...

570
00:39:29,552 --> 00:39:32,385
you're her.

571
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:37,325
Sweet, bright. She's a quantum physicist.

572
00:39:37,393 --> 00:39:39,691
That's why you read those books.

573
00:39:39,762 --> 00:39:43,994
We were very much in love, engaged to be married.

574
00:39:44,067 --> 00:39:48,197
In fact, we had a wedding, or, rather, I did.

575
00:39:48,271 --> 00:39:50,000
She didn't show?

576
00:39:54,644 --> 00:39:57,238
Why?

577
00:39:58,247 --> 00:40:00,306
I think she was afraid to commit.

578
00:40:01,417 --> 00:40:03,351
Afraid...

579
00:40:03,419 --> 00:40:05,649
that I'd leave her...

580
00:40:05,722 --> 00:40:07,917
the way her father left her.

581
00:40:08,958 --> 00:40:12,155
I don't wanna see you run away
when your chance for happiness comes.

582
00:40:12,228 --> 00:40:15,755
That's why I'm taking you to see your father.

583
00:40:16,933 --> 00:40:19,094
You're taking me to see my father?

584
00:40:20,236 --> 00:40:21,760
Yes.

585
00:40:31,447 --> 00:40:34,610
You really are romantic.

586
00:40:35,618 --> 00:40:39,315
<i>To show I love you</i>

587
00:40:39,389 --> 00:40:42,187
<i>Thinking of you</i>

588
00:40:42,258 --> 00:40:47,286
<i>Write your name across the sky... </i>

589
00:40:59,475 --> 00:41:01,340
May I help you?

590
00:41:01,411 --> 00:41:03,504
Yeah. We're just going up
to see Colonel Wojohowitz.

591
00:41:03,579 --> 00:41:05,513
Can I have your names, please?

592
00:41:05,581 --> 00:41:09,677
Yeah. I'm Dr. Gerald Bryant and
this is the Colonel's daughter, Donna.

593
00:41:09,752 --> 00:41:12,846
Oh. Colonel Wojohowitz. Oh, thanks.

594
00:41:12,922 --> 00:41:14,856
Uh, sir, excuse me.

595
00:41:14,924 --> 00:41:17,085
The Colonel has a "Do not disturb" on his line.

596
00:41:18,394 --> 00:41:20,328
Well, this is his daughter.

597
00:41:20,396 --> 00:41:22,796
Could we see some
identification, Miss Wojohowitz?

598
00:41:22,865 --> 00:41:25,493
Oh, I use my mother's maiden name.

599
00:41:26,936 --> 00:41:30,337
I'm sorry, but unless you can prove you're
his daughter, I can't ring through.

600
00:41:31,541 --> 00:41:33,475
You're welcome to wait here
and catch him when he leaves.

601
00:41:33,543 --> 00:41:37,035
Well, that'll be a little late. He's
shipping out to Vietnam this morning.

602
00:41:37,113 --> 00:41:41,709
Look, she's driven all
night from Ohio to see her father.

603
00:41:41,784 --> 00:41:43,718
Couldn't you just please...

604
00:41:43,786 --> 00:41:46,152
call him on the phone and tell
him that his daughter's here?

605
00:41:46,222 --> 00:41:48,850
I'm sorry, sir. I can't do that.

606
00:41:48,925 --> 00:41:51,393
Thank you. You've been most helpful.

607
00:42:08,845 --> 00:42:10,904
Guess it wasn't meant to be.

608
00:42:12,582 --> 00:42:15,073
You sound like Ziggy. Who?

609
00:42:21,624 --> 00:42:23,751
Something about that guy bothers me.

610
00:42:30,099 --> 00:42:33,364
There's a car in visitor's
lot. I didn't see it there earlier.

611
00:42:44,981 --> 00:42:46,915
Harry, this car has Ohio plates.

612
00:42:46,983 --> 00:42:48,848
Check the back. I'll put Jeff on alert.

613
00:42:48,918 --> 00:42:50,852
Roger.

614
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,219
Oh, no. We're gonna get in trouble.

615
00:42:55,291 --> 00:42:57,919
Don't worry. I'll protect you.

616
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,631
So it wasn't meant to be?

617
00:43:44,273 --> 00:43:46,935
This was a mistake.

618
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:53,243
No. The mistake was waiting 10 years.

619
00:43:59,121 --> 00:44:02,318
I'm sorry, baby. I love you.

620
00:44:02,391 --> 00:44:04,325
Ohhh.

621
00:44:04,393 --> 00:44:07,487
That's all I wanted to hear, Daddy.

622
00:44:15,571 --> 00:44:17,505
Don't leave.

623
00:44:20,076 --> 00:44:22,010
I'll be in the car.

624
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:27,447
Uh, if only you were a little...

625
00:44:27,516 --> 00:44:29,507
Little younger?

626
00:44:29,585 --> 00:44:33,783
Uh, or I was a little older.

627
00:44:37,426 --> 00:44:39,417
You will be.

628
00:44:52,008 --> 00:44:53,976
Where's Jerry?

629
00:44:55,277 --> 00:44:57,245
You don't need Dr. Bryant.

630
00:44:59,015 --> 00:45:01,074
Not with me here.

631
00:45:02,885 --> 00:45:05,615
Well,

632
00:45:05,688 --> 00:45:08,054
you are big.

633
00:45:18,534 --> 00:45:21,162
Harry, we got an open door.

634
00:45:23,739 --> 00:45:28,005
Police, this is the
Watergate. We have a break-in here.

635
00:45:28,077 --> 00:45:30,511
Jamie-Lee,

636
00:45:30,579 --> 00:45:32,570
you make me so hor...

637
00:45:34,316 --> 00:45:36,409
breathless with passion.

638
00:45:47,596 --> 00:45:50,190
You seem pretty pleased with yourself.

639
00:45:51,667 --> 00:45:53,760
Yeah.

640
00:45:53,836 --> 00:45:56,236
Mm. Well, so am I.

641
00:45:56,305 --> 00:46:00,071
'Course, Ziggy's blowing out microchips
like they were popcorn.

642
00:46:00,142 --> 00:46:02,007
He just... He didn't see it coming.

643
00:46:02,078 --> 00:46:03,545
What? What?

644
00:46:03,612 --> 00:46:07,708
Sam, this is the 17 th of June, 1972.

645
00:46:07,783 --> 00:46:11,116
So? So?

646
00:46:11,187 --> 00:46:13,348
We're in the Watergate!

647
00:46:14,356 --> 00:46:18,315
Break-in. Nixon. Impeachment.

648
00:46:20,029 --> 00:46:21,963
I don't remember.

649
00:46:22,031 --> 00:46:25,091
Oh, boy. The Republicans would love you.

650
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,835
You know, I don't understand you, pal.

651
00:46:33,909 --> 00:46:37,174
Well, you're wearing that goofball grin...

652
00:46:37,246 --> 00:46:41,512
and Donna is probably gonna end up
marrying that sucker that she hooked before you.

653
00:46:41,584 --> 00:46:45,850
Maybe not. Maybe she'll jilt him and marry me.

654
00:46:45,921 --> 00:46:49,322
Wanna bet? Yeah. I got connections.

655
00:46:50,926 --> 00:46:54,657
Then how come you haven't leaped yet?

656
00:47:08,677 --> 00:47:10,702
Maybe I need a shotgun...

657
00:47:21,724 --> 00:47:24,852
Get up. ! Get up. ! One, two, three...

658
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:27,259
Up! Up! Come on! four,

659
00:47:27,329 --> 00:47:29,593
five, six.
