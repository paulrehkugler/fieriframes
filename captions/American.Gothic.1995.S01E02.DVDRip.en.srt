1
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,609
Previously on American Gothic.

2
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:28,111
I'll handle this.

3
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:29,780
Someone's at the door.

4
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:35,911
Deputy! Keep that monster
away from my boy.

5
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,288
I have the sad duty
of reporting...

6
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,457
the victim's father
is our prime suspect.

7
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:41,667
I want the boy.

8
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,044
Caleb isn't going
anywhere until I say so.

9
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,681
This document grants
me sole custody of Caleb.

10
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:59,518
And I'd like you to sign it.

11
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,356
He's coming.

12
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:12,489
Are you a ghost?
No.

13
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,867
Angel?
I'm your family.

14
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:18,579
Be careful, Caleb.
Someone's at the door.

15
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,623
No more running, son.

16
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,168
That's good liquor
you're wasting there, son.

17
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:27,254
I ain't your son.
I beg to differ.

18
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,970
Caleb!

19
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:18,388
The water truck
should be there...

20
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:19,598
Hold the water truck.

21
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,808
Deb, the farm house is toast.

22
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:24,895
We got a 10-year-old boy
with a 30-minute start.

23
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,105
I want him back by sundown.

24
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:30,859
The man who comes through
for me wins a steak dinner.

25
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:33,403
What the hell is this,
Sheriff, High Noon?

26
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,572
This boy isn't a criminal.
He's just running...

27
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,616
because he's lost
his family and he's scared.

28
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:41,286
He's running, Doctor,
because you couldn't
keep him in your hospital.

29
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:44,540
And I couldn't keep you out.
You want to do something
for this boy...

30
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:47,459
just leave him the hell alone.
We're wasting time.

31
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:53,715
I don't believe we've met.
Not officially, anyway.

32
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,469
Gail Emory.
And I know we have.

33
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:03,684
Where you been
all these years, missy?
Lose your car keys?

34
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:07,187
Lucas, she's Caleb's cousin.
Was I talking to you?

35
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:13,193
If you're looking
for the mall,
it ain't built yet.

36
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,198
I'm coming with
you to find Caleb.

37
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,369
Got the family nose
for news, do you?

38
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,997
If that's what it takes
to get your attention.

39
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:29,168
Ma'am, you already
have my attention.
That's Sheriff Lucas Buck.

40
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:31,336
That's Buck with a "B."

41
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:37,843
Gentlemen, we have an
esteemed member of the press
joining us this afternoon.

42
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:42,014
Please make her feel welcome,
and feel free
to sing my praises.

43
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,602
Sadly, the good doctor...

44
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,442
will be needed elsewhere.

45
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:05,495
Something's
up at the hospital.
I have to get back.

46
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,497
Go ahead. I'll be fine.

47
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:12,002
That boy is gonna need medical
attention as soon as
he's found. You understand me?

48
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:17,424
Howdy, boys. Meet Dr. Crower.

49
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,225
Get, get. Let's go.

50
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,936
Get out there, come on.

51
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,907
Does Caleb know
his father is dead?

52
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,159
I don't see how he could,
he been running all night.

53
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:29,371
You have to understand, ma'am,
when something like this
happens to a child...

54
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,290
you just can't...
When I was 8 years old...

55
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,041
I lost my parents.

56
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,461
I do understand.
Shoot. Course you did.

57
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:40,007
Then you know how traumatic
something like this can be.

58
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:43,594
I believe Caleb
burned down his house
as a cry for help...

59
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:47,890
to protest
the loss of his sister.
Well, that's one theory.

60
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:52,936
You got a better one?
Maybe he just wanted
to get away from you.

61
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,109
Must be tough working
for a man like that.

62
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:03,780
Or maybe not.

63
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,539
Look, whatever you think
about Lucas, he's helped out
a lot of folks in this town.

64
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:16,710
How's that?
Well, by giving them
a second chance.

65
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:22,758
After high school,
I went down to Georgia,
run fullback.

66
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:26,053
Junior year,
I blew my knee out...

67
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,805
and the same week,
my girlfriend got pregnant.

68
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:34,019
So suddenly I had
no scholarship, no money,
and a baby on the way.

69
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:37,064
So he gave you a job?

70
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:41,401
Not only that, he paid
for my damn wedding.

71
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:47,533
Course, now I'm divorced,
and hardly ever see my kid...

72
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:50,911
but still I can't
forget what...

73
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,871
Lucas done for me.

74
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,416
You're a loyal man.

75
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:02,214
Well, you got to be.
No matter what it costs you?

76
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:14,059
Dr. Truelane to O.R. please.
Dr. Truelane to O.R.

77
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,068
You the coroner?

78
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:27,239
Yes. Yes, ma'am, I am.

79
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:31,201
I got Lucas' message.
How much time will you need?

80
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:37,958
Look, I don't usually
work this way.
I understand. How much time?

81
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:43,755
Well, I suppose an hour
would keep things within
the realm of possibility.

82
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:46,884
An hour for two autopsies?
You're faster than I am.

83
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,054
You make sure
the doctor doesn't disturb me.

84
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:56,018
Honey, I'm craving
medical attention.

85
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,005
I'm coming for you, boy.

86
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:34,515
Deputy, thanks for the ride.
Say, Doc.

87
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:39,436
Are you gonna be examining
Mr. Temple's body
any time soon?

88
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:41,063
That's up to the coroner.

89
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:43,106
Oh, yeah. Right.
Why?

90
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:46,068
It's nothing really, but...

91
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,821
I mean, I don't know
if you happen
to know how he died.

92
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:53,992
I found the body.
Then so you do
know about the...

93
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:57,454
The pen in his windpipe?
Yeah. The pen.

94
00:08:57,538 --> 00:09:01,792
Yeah, what about it?
Well, now,
this was a suicide, right?

95
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,085
It looks that way.

96
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:07,297
Well, did anybody happen
to mention to you
who the pen belonged to?

97
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,174
No.

98
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:14,805
Well, it was mine.

99
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:23,605
Now, you got to believe me
when I say that I didn't
have anything to do...

100
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:26,942
with Gage's death.
I swear, I'd never
do nothing like that but...

101
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,781
I loved that pen.
I see.

102
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,409
And I'd really
like to get it back.

103
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:38,829
And how did Mr. Temple
get ahold of it?

104
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,166
Well, now, I don't know that.

105
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:47,880
But I swear I had nothing
to do with it.
You got to believe me.

106
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:50,841
I believe you, Ben...

107
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:54,344
but I'm not the one
you have to convince.

108
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,471
Look, I'm meeting
the coroner this afternoon.

109
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:59,099
When he's done
with his autopsy,
I'll see what I can do.

110
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:02,936
Okay, Doc.
I appreciate that. You know...

111
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,024
it was kind of like
a lucky charm, you know.
My mom gave it to me.

112
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:14,323
Well, you take care of
yourself, Doc, and everything
is going to be fine.

113
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,909
And don't worry about the boy.
We're gonna find him.

114
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:18,744
Everything is going
to be fine.

115
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,956
Everything
is going to be fine.

116
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,254
I'll call you when
I'm finished.
All right.

117
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:05,916
Oral report to be transferred
to short-form protocol.

118
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,087
I, Curtis Z. Webb,
performed autopsy
on the body of...

119
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:14,550
Gage Temple at 10.30 a.m.

120
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:19,763
From the anatomic findings
and pertinent history
I ascribe the death to...

121
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,975
suicide.

122
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:27,229
And I'm a lying
sack of goat manure.

123
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:41,869
I, Curtis Z. Webb...

124
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,997
performed autopsy
on the body of...

125
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:48,208
Merlyn Ann Temple at...

126
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:52,671
11.00 a.m.

127
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:57,342
From the anatomic findings
and pertinent history...

128
00:11:57,676 --> 00:11:59,887
I ascribe the death to...

129
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:09,938
"massive head trauma."

130
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:33,754
God forgive me.

131
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:56,568
Someone's at the door.

132
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,695
Someone's at the door.
Someone's at the door.

133
00:12:58,779 --> 00:12:59,780
Someone's at the door.

134
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,559
Someone's at the door.

135
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,933
Merlyn?

136
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:14,021
Is this what I look like?

137
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:21,820
You look the same.

138
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:23,906
I don't feel the same.

139
00:14:24,323 --> 00:14:26,783
Caleb, it's nice
to see you again.

140
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:29,036
For me, too, Merly.

141
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,830
The sheriff is after me.
He thinks he's my daddy.

142
00:14:32,623 --> 00:14:35,250
What do you think?
I think he's crazy.

143
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:37,336
This whole thing is crazy.

144
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:40,297
He wants to raise
you in his image, Caleb.

145
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,385
You can't run forever.

146
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:49,181
Why not? I don't need him.
I don't need nobody.

147
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:54,686
I'm gonna make
it hard for them.
I'm going to a secret place.

148
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,813
Caleb.
That's where I'm going.

149
00:14:56,897 --> 00:15:01,068
And this sweatshirt ought
to give them dogs something
to look for downstream.

150
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:03,695
Get it?

151
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,866
That's why I got
to go upstream.

152
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:11,995
I'll paddle my way to hell
and back to get away
from that sheriff.

153
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:15,624
You want to come with me?

154
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:19,378
Be careful, Caleb, you may not
like what you find up there.

155
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:22,840
All right, then.
I'll tell you what
I find, I guess.

156
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,800
See you later, Merlyn.

157
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:33,684
This isn't exactly
an emergency.

158
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:36,270
I'm sorry.

159
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:38,647
I guess I got
a little hysterical.

160
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,066
How did this happen?

161
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,070
Well, you know kids,
sometimes they like
to roughhouse.

162
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,073
A child did this?

163
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:51,118
Well, I'm a school teacher,
Dr. Crower?

164
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,287
And I was wrestling
with one of my boys...

165
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,706
on the playground
and he got a little frisky.

166
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,042
Must have been
a pretty big boy.

167
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:02,963
I'm going to give
you a tetanus shot.

168
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:06,967
Will it be painful?
Not really.

169
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:13,932
Hip?
That'd be fine.

170
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:18,937
Someone once told me
that you should always
make yourself laugh...

171
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:20,772
when you're getting a shot.

172
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:24,359
That way, you don't
feel the pain as much.

173
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:28,363
But I think in life,
you have to take
the good with the bad.

174
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:30,949
Do we have a choice?

175
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,535
Always have a choice, Doctor.

176
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:36,288
Which one would you prefer?

177
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,043
I'm gonna need you
to turn around.

178
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:45,547
Silly me.

179
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:58,352
Everything all right?
Heaven.

180
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:14,117
All right. Hurry up. Hurry up.
You sure work fast, Doc.

181
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:16,870
I know I work fast.
Why don't you try
doing the same?

182
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:28,006
Where are they going?
Down the hall for pick up.

183
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,598
Oh, no.

184
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:40,686
Let me get out of here.

185
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:46,316
Don't.

186
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,696
Don't bury...

187
00:17:57,786 --> 00:18:00,622
Don't bury the truth.

188
00:18:09,882 --> 00:18:13,468
Don't bury the truth.

189
00:18:16,555 --> 00:18:18,473
You sure we're going
the right way?

190
00:18:19,725 --> 00:18:21,685
We're moving away from town.

191
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:24,188
Caleb wouldn't go back there.
Town means hospital.

192
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:28,734
Dr. Crower seems to think
the boy only ran
because you scared him.

193
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:30,360
That doctor should
take a pill.

194
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:33,739
If Caleb had been
with me last night, none
of this would have happened.

195
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:37,284
What do you want with him?
I'm just doing my job, ma'am.

196
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:40,204
Got to protect my people.
Like you did my parents?

197
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,792
I believe your tone
has offended someone.

198
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:50,964
For almost 20 years now,
I've questioned
how my parents died.

199
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:54,134
And last month
I finally got
the coroner's report.

200
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,054
You're the one who found them.

201
00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:00,641
How come you never
contacted me?

202
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,268
They died in a fire, ma'am.

203
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:06,355
Did you really want
the grisly details?

204
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:09,608
No, they died
because they were
trapped in a building.

205
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:13,445
Someone had locked
them in there.

206
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:23,121
Miss Coombs, I really
have to get going.
I'm sorry.

207
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:25,290
Here I am going
on about me and...

208
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:28,752
you've got all these
wounded souls to heal.

209
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,380
Is this your family?

210
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:35,092
Beautiful ladies.

211
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:37,970
Yes, they were.

212
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:40,806
Past tense?

213
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:46,937
Doctor, I am so sorry.

214
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:52,192
I had no idea.
That's okay. That's fine.

215
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:54,194
Now, if you don't mind.

216
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,281
Am I interrupting something?
No.

217
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,158
You feel better.

218
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:05,664
Is the coroner here yet?
Just left.

219
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:09,168
I thought he was doing
the autopsies on the
Temple girl and her father.

220
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,795
Yeah, I thought so, too.
But he just got the bodies...

221
00:20:11,837 --> 00:20:13,755
and hauled them out of here.

222
00:20:17,301 --> 00:20:19,303
And what are we gonna
do with this?

223
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:22,848
Sorry, Dan. I would have
been there. That woman
just wouldn't leave.

224
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,350
Not that it wasn't
enjoyable on some level.

225
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:27,186
Keep it on
a superficial level.

226
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:30,522
I've heard stories about
her that would make
your toes curl.

227
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:43,952
Come on with it, girl.

228
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:48,874
They really burying
these two side-by-side?

229
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:51,084
Yeah. First thing
in the morning.

230
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:53,045
That's foul.

231
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:56,215
Just 'cause he killed her,
don't mean they can't share
the same worms.

232
00:20:57,508 --> 00:20:59,718
No offense, Daddy,
but this ain't your best work.

233
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:03,013
I only had two hours.
You know, Sheriff
put in a rush.

234
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:04,890
"Rest in Pease."

235
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:10,771
Rest in pease?

236
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:16,026
You got him resting
in peas, Daddy.
I'll rest you.

237
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,198
Well, we'll fix it tomorrow.
Come on, Teapot.

238
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:24,535
I got a shovel at home
with your name on it.

239
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,455
If you ever kill me...

240
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:31,500
hope you'll do it
with something cleaner
than a shovel.

241
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:33,752
How about a pen?

242
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:41,093
What... What are you...

243
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:52,187
Hey!

244
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:11,707
Sheriff?

245
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:16,378
Dogs found this
about a quarter of a mile
downriver.

246
00:22:19,256 --> 00:22:20,924
Smart boy.

247
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:46,325
What are you doing?

248
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:49,328
Praying.

249
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:01,228
Merlyn?

250
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:04,231
I used to be able
to feel the sun.

251
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:05,941
I miss it.

252
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:18,287
Why are you still running?

253
00:26:19,705 --> 00:26:21,373
Daddy is dead, Merlyn.

254
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:24,042
Seen his grave.

255
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:26,545
Yours, too.

256
00:26:29,047 --> 00:26:30,424
Everybody is dead.

257
00:26:30,757 --> 00:26:32,050
Not everybody.

258
00:26:39,975 --> 00:26:41,602
I ain't going in there.

259
00:26:41,685 --> 00:26:43,562
That man needs your help.

260
00:26:44,438 --> 00:26:46,607
He's a monster.
No.

261
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,901
Can you understand
his pain, Caleb?

262
00:26:49,735 --> 00:26:51,069
He's just hurt.

263
00:26:51,862 --> 00:26:54,865
I would think
you could understand
that, Caleb.

264
00:27:35,489 --> 00:27:36,782
Look...

265
00:27:36,865 --> 00:27:38,367
I want to free you.

266
00:27:38,534 --> 00:27:39,785
But if you don't...

267
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:42,204
Don't do that.

268
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:48,043
Listen, I'm gonna free you.

269
00:27:48,627 --> 00:27:51,171
We're gonna be friends,
right, if I do?

270
00:27:57,511 --> 00:27:59,429
Sorry I ran out on you...

271
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:03,600
but I didn't know
what you was all about.

272
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:15,946
God, you're freezing.

273
00:28:17,155 --> 00:28:18,657
Can you walk?

274
00:28:21,118 --> 00:28:23,245
We got to find you a doctor.

275
00:28:34,506 --> 00:28:36,508
Sol.

276
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:42,222
Sol?

277
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:55,944
You don't have
to pay me nothing.

278
00:29:01,325 --> 00:29:03,327
I guess we could
use some food.

279
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:08,624
All right, Sol, I'm gonna
get us some food
and try to find you a doctor.

280
00:29:08,707 --> 00:29:11,335
I'll be back with help, Sol.

281
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:12,711
I promise.

282
00:29:22,387 --> 00:29:24,848
No one knows why
these things happen.

283
00:29:26,016 --> 00:29:28,602
And maybe it's not
our job to ask.

284
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:34,733
But, like the Reverend said,
we can take comfort
knowing that...

285
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:38,237
Gage and Merlyn
are in a better place.

286
00:29:40,822 --> 00:29:44,034
I plant this tree
in their memory, hopeful
that someday it might...

287
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:46,161
capture the spirit
of the family.

288
00:29:50,249 --> 00:29:53,126
Thank you all for coming.
Thank you, Sheriff.

289
00:29:54,545 --> 00:29:57,047
How well did you know
Gage Temple?

290
00:29:57,506 --> 00:29:58,966
Not too well.

291
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:01,468
He pretty much
kept to himself.

292
00:30:01,552 --> 00:30:05,305
Neighbors said he was
a quiet man, never gave
anyone any trouble.

293
00:30:06,306 --> 00:30:09,184
Getting all the facts, ma'am?
What's happening with Caleb?

294
00:30:09,434 --> 00:30:10,936
A crew has been
out since dawn.

295
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:12,688
Now that we know
where he's traveling...

296
00:30:12,771 --> 00:30:15,732
we could have
your little cousin
back home in no time.

297
00:30:16,942 --> 00:30:19,695
Can we offer you
a ride back to town,
Miss Emory?

298
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:22,155
No, thank you.

299
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,741
Want to make sure
you're taken care of.

300
00:30:24,783 --> 00:30:27,327
Tourists are our lifeblood,
right, Ben?

301
00:30:27,578 --> 00:30:29,788
Is that why they keep
disappearing?

302
00:30:32,082 --> 00:30:33,750
Fire up the car.

303
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,503
You know, according
to my editor...

304
00:30:36,587 --> 00:30:39,673
this county is like
the Bermuda Triangle
of tourism.

305
00:30:40,007 --> 00:30:43,927
We rank lowest
in serious crime
in the entire state, ma'am.

306
00:30:44,595 --> 00:30:47,014
And highest
in missing persons.

307
00:30:47,556 --> 00:30:51,310
Last spring, there
was a reporter
from the Miami Tribune.

308
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:53,645
He came up here
to investigate.

309
00:30:54,188 --> 00:30:56,106
And he hasn't been
heard from since.

310
00:30:56,148 --> 00:30:58,442
Well, this is
a recreational area.

311
00:30:58,483 --> 00:31:01,653
Between the woods
and the beaches,
accidents happen.

312
00:31:02,571 --> 00:31:04,323
Maybe he was a poor swimmer.

313
00:31:05,532 --> 00:31:08,118
Or maybe he was just
a poor judge of character.

314
00:31:10,829 --> 00:31:12,331
Good day, Sheriff.

315
00:31:16,835 --> 00:31:19,296
Sorry, I didn't get
to meet your little friend.

316
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:22,090
You will.

317
00:32:11,932 --> 00:32:13,350
Hello.

318
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,201
Hello?

319
00:32:32,202 --> 00:32:33,203
Hello.

320
00:32:35,372 --> 00:32:36,540
Yes, sir?

321
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,208
Is your father home?

322
00:32:38,292 --> 00:32:39,877
Daddy.

323
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,461
Daddy.

324
00:32:48,302 --> 00:32:50,012
We're eating cake.

325
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:54,933
What kind of cake?

326
00:32:55,017 --> 00:32:56,518
Goat cheese.

327
00:32:58,979 --> 00:33:00,981
Mr. Webb?
Yes, sir.

328
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:02,441
I'm Matt Crower.

329
00:33:02,524 --> 00:33:04,151
I missed you yesterday.

330
00:33:04,234 --> 00:33:07,112
Right, the new doctor.
Could we have a word?

331
00:33:07,905 --> 00:33:09,740
Go on to your mama, Taylor.

332
00:33:10,824 --> 00:33:12,784
She's a sweet girl.
Yes, she is.

333
00:33:12,868 --> 00:33:14,119
A little slow.

334
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:17,998
How can I help you, Doc?

335
00:33:18,457 --> 00:33:20,667
I was curious about the result
of your autopsies...

336
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:22,461
on Gage and Merlyn Temple.

337
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,588
Thank you.

338
00:33:25,422 --> 00:33:27,090
Eli, food.

339
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:31,512
This here is Eli.
He's my sweetie pie.

340
00:33:32,513 --> 00:33:34,306
He's our big boy.

341
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:40,646
Why did you release
their bodies
from the hospital so early?

342
00:33:42,856 --> 00:33:44,900
You know the amazing
thing about goats?

343
00:33:45,234 --> 00:33:48,946
They'll eat anything.
Most self-sufficient
creatures in the world.

344
00:33:49,112 --> 00:33:51,657
Feed them shoes,
get back milk.

345
00:33:52,324 --> 00:33:53,450
Mr. Webb...

346
00:33:53,534 --> 00:33:56,453
That nanny over there
is expecting. Should have
kids by Christmas.

347
00:33:56,745 --> 00:33:58,622
The Temples
were buried this morning.

348
00:33:58,664 --> 00:34:01,291
How did you have time
to complete your work?

349
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:05,587
The girl took a shovel
to the head, am I right?

350
00:34:05,671 --> 00:34:06,797
According to the Sheriff.

351
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:10,926
And the father was found
with a pen in his throat,
self-inflicted.

352
00:34:11,093 --> 00:34:12,636
Is that your finding?

353
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,013
Well, there was blood
all over his hand.

354
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,933
What about the angle of entry
or the depth of the wound?

355
00:34:18,851 --> 00:34:21,270
You know what I love
about these animals?

356
00:34:21,562 --> 00:34:24,189
They accept things
as they are.

357
00:34:26,483 --> 00:34:29,069
You didn't do any
autopsies, did you?

358
00:34:31,738 --> 00:34:33,866
I take pride
in my work, Doctor.

359
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:37,411
But sometimes,
other forces prevail.

360
00:34:38,203 --> 00:34:41,039
Girl died of head trauma.
Father was a suicide.

361
00:34:41,081 --> 00:34:42,583
I accept that.

362
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:45,085
And I suggest you do the same.

363
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:47,337
Mr. Webb...

364
00:34:48,881 --> 00:34:51,758
Lucas Buck was the last person
to see these people alive.

365
00:34:51,842 --> 00:34:55,804
He was also the last person
to see Caleb Temple's mother
before she died.

366
00:34:56,096 --> 00:34:58,682
That's three members
of the same family gone.

367
00:35:00,684 --> 00:35:02,477
Why are you protecting him?

368
00:35:02,561 --> 00:35:05,647
Because I have a family, too.

369
00:35:38,931 --> 00:35:40,182
Caleb.

370
00:35:40,933 --> 00:35:44,061
You really my cousin?
Yeah.

371
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,980
How come I
never heard of you?

372
00:35:49,525 --> 00:35:51,276
I left town a long time ago.

373
00:35:51,735 --> 00:35:53,403
Before you were born.

374
00:35:53,487 --> 00:35:56,573
You working with the Sheriff?
No.

375
00:35:57,407 --> 00:35:59,159
I'm here to help you.

376
00:35:59,243 --> 00:36:02,120
Well, I don't need no help.
I need a ride.

377
00:36:05,123 --> 00:36:06,542
Get in.

378
00:36:29,314 --> 00:36:32,234
Daddy, why do you put trees
on these things?

379
00:36:32,317 --> 00:36:34,486
Supposed to represent death...

380
00:36:34,695 --> 00:36:36,321
and rebirth.

381
00:36:36,738 --> 00:36:38,073
It's also easy to paint.

382
00:36:39,825 --> 00:36:41,410
So, what do you think?

383
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:44,204
I liked him better in "pease."

384
00:36:44,621 --> 00:36:46,206
Get my coat, girl.

385
00:36:49,793 --> 00:36:50,961
Daddy...

386
00:36:52,963 --> 00:36:56,425
what was you saying
about rebirth?

387
00:36:57,843 --> 00:37:00,470
This wasn't no bigger
than a shrub a minute ago.

388
00:37:00,512 --> 00:37:02,472
God. Come on, Teapot.

389
00:37:03,015 --> 00:37:04,516
I can get it.

390
00:37:05,058 --> 00:37:06,560
Holy Mother of God.

391
00:37:07,644 --> 00:37:10,355
No, I said come on. Teapot!

392
00:37:16,987 --> 00:37:18,989
Rita, I'm going
to need an ambulance.

393
00:37:19,072 --> 00:37:20,991
They'll never find him.
I got to take you.

394
00:37:21,033 --> 00:37:22,367
Hold off, Rita.

395
00:37:22,576 --> 00:37:24,953
Caleb, I can't let
you leave again.
If anything happens...

396
00:37:25,037 --> 00:37:27,080
But look, the man
is expecting me.

397
00:37:27,164 --> 00:37:29,416
Look, he even
gave me some money...

398
00:37:31,376 --> 00:37:32,753
for food.

399
00:37:37,716 --> 00:37:39,301
You got to trust me.

400
00:37:40,052 --> 00:37:42,054
I won't run away, I promise.

401
00:37:42,638 --> 00:37:44,056
This is the guy.

402
00:37:44,389 --> 00:37:46,975
What guy?
Rafael Santo.

403
00:37:47,184 --> 00:37:50,771
He's a reporter
my editor told me about.
He's been missing for months.

404
00:37:53,482 --> 00:37:55,234
I thought you said
his name was Sol.

405
00:37:55,275 --> 00:37:58,445
Who cares what his name is.
We gonna help him or not?

406
00:37:59,238 --> 00:38:01,573
This son of a bitch
is really beginning to irk me.

407
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:05,536
Well, don't doctors
usually talk to the coroner
after there has been a...

408
00:38:05,953 --> 00:38:07,538
suicide?

409
00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:10,123
Yeah, but my coroners
don't usually talk back.

410
00:38:10,207 --> 00:38:11,625
Hey, Sheriff,
got your chocolates.

411
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:14,086
Glad to hear it, Louise,
you have
a killer birthday, now.

412
00:38:14,169 --> 00:38:16,129
Maybe Curtis thought
he was doing you a favor.

413
00:38:16,213 --> 00:38:17,673
Are you defending him?

414
00:38:17,756 --> 00:38:20,717
No, I'm just...
Don't drop
the loyalty ball, Ben.

415
00:38:20,801 --> 00:38:22,052
Feeling better, Albert?

416
00:38:22,094 --> 00:38:24,638
Appreciate
you straightening things
out with my boss, Lucas.

417
00:38:24,721 --> 00:38:27,307
You bet. This coroner made
a big mistake, Ben.

418
00:38:27,391 --> 00:38:29,726
And if you don't see that,
you don't see much.

419
00:38:29,768 --> 00:38:31,478
I'm not being disloyal, Lucas.

420
00:38:31,562 --> 00:38:33,981
I'm just trying to clarify.
That's all.
Good.

421
00:38:34,064 --> 00:38:36,650
Because if this doctor
gives me anymore trouble...

422
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:38,151
you're gonna shoot him.

423
00:38:51,707 --> 00:38:52,916
Damn.

424
00:39:15,272 --> 00:39:16,648
Thank you.

425
00:39:24,323 --> 00:39:27,159
Hey, baby.
What's the matter?

426
00:39:30,871 --> 00:39:32,456
Eli.

427
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:36,376
Lunch time, Eli.

428
00:39:58,482 --> 00:40:00,442
You told me this was handled.

429
00:40:01,944 --> 00:40:04,863
Well, I'm sorry, Lucas,
but I just couldn't hurt him.

430
00:40:04,947 --> 00:40:06,740
So you kept him as a pet?

431
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:09,368
I liked him, okay?

432
00:40:11,453 --> 00:40:13,747
To tell you the truth,
he kind of liked me.

433
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:17,292
This is a real problem,
Selena.

434
00:40:18,293 --> 00:40:19,545
Well, look...

435
00:40:19,628 --> 00:40:23,423
if the doctor finds him
before we do, maybe
it's not such a bad thing.

436
00:40:25,133 --> 00:40:26,802
Rafael hasn't been
eating lately...

437
00:40:26,885 --> 00:40:29,012
and I've been kind
of worried about him.

438
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:32,516
Rafael is a reporter.
He's gonna report things.

439
00:40:33,141 --> 00:40:34,768
He won't say a word.

440
00:40:34,852 --> 00:40:38,605
Really? What did you do?
Bite off his tongue
in a fit of passion.

441
00:40:49,116 --> 00:40:51,827
Mr. Santo, can you hear me?

442
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:54,788
Okay, you're going
to be all right.
I'm here to help you, okay?

443
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:01,086
He's hypothermic.

444
00:41:03,255 --> 00:41:05,883
I don't think he's
gonna make it to the hospital.

445
00:41:12,598 --> 00:41:14,600
Is there anything
we can do for you?

446
00:41:22,649 --> 00:41:24,318
It's Spanish.

447
00:41:24,985 --> 00:41:25,986
Sol.

448
00:41:34,953 --> 00:41:37,831
Sun.
Matt, he's freezing.

449
00:41:38,957 --> 00:41:40,792
Where do you want them?

450
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,797
Here, can you cover him up?
Sure.

451
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:47,758
Caleb, come here.

452
00:41:50,302 --> 00:41:53,472
Do you think you can
get up there and pry off
one of those boards?

453
00:41:53,972 --> 00:41:57,434
Well, if this is what
Sol wants, this is what
Sol is gonna get.

454
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:27,297
Y'all were right.

455
00:42:27,506 --> 00:42:29,758
Sol is warming right up.

456
00:42:33,095 --> 00:42:35,514
That was just what
you needed, huh, Sol?

457
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,980
Matt?

458
00:42:43,564 --> 00:42:45,816
Look. Look at this.

459
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,581
Just what you needed.

460
00:43:37,075 --> 00:43:38,869
What's the matter with him?

461
00:43:49,379 --> 00:43:50,881
He's gone, Caleb.

462
00:43:51,798 --> 00:43:53,842
But he can't be,
I got you here in time.

463
00:43:53,926 --> 00:43:55,886
You did everything
that you could.

464
00:43:56,428 --> 00:43:58,263
This wasn't supposed
to happen.

465
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:00,891
It wasn't supposed to happen.
Caleb.

466
00:44:00,933 --> 00:44:01,934
Caleb!

467
00:44:02,935 --> 00:44:05,771
Well, now, look
who's found our fugitive.

468
00:44:07,147 --> 00:44:08,607
This the man?

469
00:44:11,276 --> 00:44:13,070
What are you doing here?

470
00:44:13,237 --> 00:44:14,905
I might ask you
the same question.

471
00:44:14,947 --> 00:44:16,698
I've been hunting
this fellow for months...

472
00:44:16,782 --> 00:44:18,492
ever since he attacked
and robbed Miss Coombs.

473
00:44:18,575 --> 00:44:21,078
Wait a minute.
This man is from
the Miami Tribune.

474
00:44:21,245 --> 00:44:23,247
And somebody has been
keeping him here.

475
00:44:23,705 --> 00:44:25,624
That someone
was his partner, ma'am.

476
00:44:25,958 --> 00:44:29,169
His partner in crime
obviously double-crossed him.

477
00:44:29,962 --> 00:44:32,965
What partner?
You have this person
in custody?

478
00:44:33,048 --> 00:44:34,550
Well, we did...

479
00:44:34,883 --> 00:44:36,760
till we buried him
this morning.

480
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:41,181
Afraid Gage Temple
was more dangerous
than anyone realized.

481
00:44:47,604 --> 00:44:49,690
I'm gonna need
that for evidence.

482
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:10,043
Merlyn!

483
00:45:10,419 --> 00:45:12,296
Merlyn!

484
00:45:12,337 --> 00:45:14,506
Merlyn, you lied to me.

485
00:45:15,674 --> 00:45:17,634
You said I could
help that man.

486
00:45:17,718 --> 00:45:19,261
You did help him.

487
00:45:19,344 --> 00:45:20,804
You gave him what he needed.

488
00:45:21,305 --> 00:45:22,848
He didn't need to die.

489
00:45:22,931 --> 00:45:25,058
I don't want to see you
no more, you understand?

490
00:45:25,142 --> 00:45:27,227
You're dead. Dead as he is.

491
00:45:27,436 --> 00:45:30,272
I live in you, Caleb.
And so does your father.

492
00:45:30,355 --> 00:45:33,108
Just get out of here,
will you? Leave me alone.

493
00:45:36,403 --> 00:45:38,155
Merlyn, look out.

494
00:45:40,449 --> 00:45:41,700
Merlyn!

495
00:45:47,331 --> 00:45:48,498
Merlyn.

496
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:51,001
Merlyn, you all right?

497
00:45:51,376 --> 00:45:52,377
Merlyn.

498
00:45:56,548 --> 00:45:58,842
Merlyn!
