Ma!

159
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,521
Hey, Ma!

160
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:54,444
- Oh, my God!
- Ma!

161
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:55,779
Where is she?

162
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,782
- Who is this?
- It's Anthony!

163
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,201
The mushrooms, they're on fire!

164
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,079
Get the fire extinguisher
under the sink!

165
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,457
Oh, my God!
The wall's getting all black!

166
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,584
Ma, hang up and call 911.

167

The guy's on the second line.

168
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,964
- Aren't you coming over?
- You press "hold," goddamn it.

169
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,509
I can't, I'm 40 minutes away.

170
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:20,595
You hang up and you call 911.
Leave the house.

171
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,431
Look at how I live!

172
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,433
Ma, hang up and call 911.

173
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,236
My mother's got a fire in the kitchen.

174
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,447
- Oh, my God.
- She's calling 911. Go there.

175
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,951
- I'm on my way.
- Thank you, baby. I know you're busy.

176

Serge, Serge.

177

I can't talk now.

178

I gotta go to an outside line.

All right. I'll call you back.

180

Is your mom okay?

181

Shit cannot go on like this.

182
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,345
Hey, T. Hey, T.

183
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:06,099
This teacher, his car,
you got a plate number?

184
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,810
Call my wife.

185
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,817
- Have a nice day.
- Thanks.

186
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,360
No problem.

187
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,119
Ma.

188
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:30,540
I wish you'd let me
get somebody to help you.

189
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:34,043
- You shouldn't be alone.
- Help me what?

190
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:38,339
- With the housework.
- I have my ways.

191
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:42,510
A stranger could care less
about doing it right.

192
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:47,182
Can I tell you something though, Ma?
You need company.

193
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,769
Don't start with that nursing-home
business again.

194
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,647
This is not a nursing home.
It is a retirement community.

195
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:05,325
You want me to make you pastina?
Something in your stomach?

196
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,332
Ma, now, I've told Tony...

197
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:16,169
...and I've told you many times.

198
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,505
You can come live with us.

199
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,591
I know when I'm not wanted!

200
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:28,014
I invited you to share my home.
If you want me to beg, that's different.

201
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:34,729
Leave this place
that my husband and I shared?

202
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,107
Well, change can be a positive.

203
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,194
He was a saint.

204
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:49,327
That son of mine, is he
still having those fits?

205
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:54,749
They're not fits, Ma.
They're anxiety attacks.

206
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,876
You know, he's on medication.

207
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,469
What BMW's charging us for paint?
O trippa di zia.

208
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,224
- It's been that way for six months.
- When was I last here?

209
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,352
Hey.

210
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,939
We maybe caught a break.

211
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:22,861
Watchung Avenue said some guys brought
a Saturn trying to load it for parts.

212
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:26,739
Are you saying this car's for Tony
and leave it all in one piece?

213
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,784
Yeah, sure.
It's for the kid's teacher.

214
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:35,540
My guy said one of those goofballs
had a uniform on from Buttfucks.

215
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,502
Whatever, the coffee shop.
I guess the guy works there.

216
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,004
Watchung and what?

217
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,551
I'm fucking Rockford here.

218

CASHIER: Decaf cappuccino Primo, non-fat
Magnifico, double espresso regulare.

I'll take you here.

220
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:02,942
I think I'll have an espresso.
Paul, you want anything?

221
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,694
They got any just coffee?

222

is New Zealand Peaberry.

223

Madonna. Whatever.

224

That's $4.20. Pick up there.

One medium du jour,
one single espresso.

Honey, let me ask you.

228
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:23,713
My wife was in the body shop around
the corner the other day.

229
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:28,384
The guy in front of her leaves
and she sees he dropped...

230
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,094
...his money clip.

231
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,556
But he was already gone.
We'd like to give it back.

232
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:37,435
She said he was wearing
a uniform like that there.

233
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:40,480
Real black hair.
Tall? Little earring.

234
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,565
These stores are everywhere.

235
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,859
Yeah, tell me about it.

236
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,992
Fucking Italian people.
How'd we miss out on this?

237
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:56,579
- What?
- Fucking espresso, cappuccino.

238
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:00,124
We invent it and these
cocksuckers are getting rich.

239
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,668
Isn't it amazing?

240
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,170
It's not just money.
It's a pride thing.

241

All our food, pizza,
calzone, buffalo mozzarella...

...olive oil.

These fucks had nothing.

244
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,889
They ate puzzi before
we gave them our cuisine.

245
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:18,977
But this, this is the worst.
This espresso shit.

246
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,186
Take it easy.

She finally agreed
to have somebody come in days.

248
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:30,905
Carmela called an agency, and they
sent over this Trinidadian woman.

249
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:35,618
But no matter what I do,
I feel guilty.

250
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:36,911
Why?

251
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,501
The real reason is,
I can't let her live with us.

252
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:47,130
That doesn't seem practical,
given her personality.

253
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,843
Well, it's my wife.
She won't allow it.

Where are your sisters in this?

255
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:58,683
They cut it off with her long ago.
No way she's bunking with them.

256
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:03,312
So you're carrying all this guilt
when your mother is clearly someone...

257
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,899
...who has difficulty maintaining
any relationship.

258
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,195
But she's my mother.

259
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:15,491
You're supposed to take care of your
mother. She's a little old lady.

260
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,285
Not to you.

She's very powerful.

262
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:20,580
Bullshit.

263
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,291
You accord this "little old lady"...

264
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,544
...an almost mystical ability
to wreak havoc.

265
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:30,381
Let me tell you. You definitely
don't want to get her started.

266
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:35,511
There are some people who are not
ideal candidates for parenthood.

The loving warm ones?

270

One time we were down at the shore.

About '68, '69, the whole family.

My father, he tripped and fell down
the stairs, and we were all laughing.

The whole family was laughing.
My mother was laughing.

Any other loving experiences?

Hey, she's a good woman.

276
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,558
She put food on the table every night.

277
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:27,313
I'm the ungrateful fuck.
I come here, complain about her...

278
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,858
...and I let my wife exclude her
from my home.

...talking to her doctor
and the staff gerontoligist.

They say she shouldn't
live alone anymore.

out of Cartier's window.

any interest in my jewels.

on any of it, as I remember.
