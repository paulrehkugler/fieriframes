FEMALE:
Work your arms.
Work 'em. Work your arms.

00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:43,437
Higher, good.
Now kick, kick.
Loosen up. Kick.

23
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:44,905
Higher, higher, higher.

24
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:46,374
Side twist.

25
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,042
Now back again.
Side twist. Keep it up.

26
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,412
Twist, twist.
Very good.

27
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:54,282
Balki, don't do that.

28
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:59,387
It would help me if the floor
didn't shake before noon.

29
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:02,890
Boy, you are grumpy
in the morning.

30
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,692
I'm grumpy all the time.

31
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:07,228
I just hide it better
the rest of the day.

32
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:16,204
What are you doing?

33
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,172
Buttock pinches.

34
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:23,311
Don't forget to fold up
the couch.

35
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:24,945
You left it open yesterday.

36
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:28,749
I can't.

37
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:32,386
No, it's not so simple.

38
00:02:32,453 --> 00:02:35,389
No, no, I think--
Balki, watch and learn.

39
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:41,329
Take the little black handle.
Yes.

40
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:44,765
Balki, watch and learn.

41
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,370
You just lift and push.

42
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:54,308
Lift and push.

43
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:57,945
Lift.
And push.

44
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,749
Push and lift!

45
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,518
Lift! Oh!

46
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:06,220
Oh! Oh!

47
00:03:06,287 --> 00:03:07,521
It's broken.

48
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:09,757
No, I think
it's just a sprain.

49
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:12,793
No, I mean,
the sofa is broken.

50
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,799
Why didn't you tell me that?

51
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:22,403
Well, because I was busy
watching and learning.

52
00:03:28,476 --> 00:03:30,278
No, no, Balki.
What are you doing?

53
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:33,414
Balki, Balki, no, no, no.

54
00:03:33,481 --> 00:03:36,284
Balki! No, no. Thank you.

55
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,320
I don't need any pagan cures.

56
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,024
Oh. I could've
bought a new couch.

57
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:47,428
But no-o-o,
I had to buy a used one.

58
00:03:47,495 --> 00:03:52,600
Well, I'm the one
that sleeps there,
so I buy the new one.

59
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:53,934
Whoa!

60
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:59,440
What did we lose?

61
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:08,649
Don't you ever,
ever do that again.

62
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:10,217
What?

63
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:14,422
I was getting my money.

64
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:17,691
Well, of course I do.
I want it to be safe.

65
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:21,529
Safe?

66
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,464
get tired ransacking
the apartment

67
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:26,334
lie down to take a nap, bam!
Your money's gone.

68
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,372
No, I never
thought of that.

69
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,840
Well, you should.

70
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:38,211
Keeping money around
attracts burglars.

71
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,348
Why?

72
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:43,083
Because that
is what responsible people do.

73
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,953
What if the building was
to burn down, then where
would your money be?

74
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,422
Step into the 20th century.

75
00:04:49,557 --> 00:04:52,059
But I don't know
about banks.

76
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:56,397
What's to know?
Why do I have to
explain everything?

77
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:59,433
Look, today on our lunch hour,
I'll take you to my bank.

78
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,502
You'll put that money
in a checking account.

79
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:03,070
But this is my mad money.

80
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:08,041
Do you mean my savings too?
Yes, yes, your savings too.

81
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:09,643
Everything.
Now get it.

82
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:22,990
I got it.

83
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:25,859
You'll never get it.

84
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:32,900
LARRY:
Can we get on with this?
We're on our lunch break.

85
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:39,940
Oh, I'm Harrison Har...per.

86
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:43,310
Uh, Balki would like to
open a checking account.

87
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:44,845
I know. Sit, sit.

88
00:05:47,448 --> 00:05:49,950
All right, you've got your
Money Market Manager Account.

89
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,685
Requires a thousand dollar
minimum balance.

90
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:53,487
Includes check guarantee,
credit card,

91
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:55,723
overdraft protection,
which means you can
write checks

92
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:59,259
up to $5000 over your balance
and a free color TV.

93
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:01,729
Oh, I like that one.

94
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:04,398
Balki, I think that's a little
out of your league.

95
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:06,567
What is my league?
Little League.

96
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,104
Our Happy Saver Account.

97
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:12,973
Requires a minimum balance
of two dollars

98
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,709
and you get a free
Freddy the Frog bag.

99
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:17,244
He'll take that one.

100
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,146
Balki, give him your money.

101
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,417
Just one moment.

102
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:30,958
When I put my money here,
what are you
going to do with it?

103
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:33,427
The same thing
they do with my money.

104
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:36,564
They loan it out
to other people for interest.

105
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,298
They give my money
to other people

106
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:40,033
just because it's interesting?

107
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,136
No, no, no. Interest is
what people pay the bank

108
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:44,705
so that they can use your money.

109
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:48,609
Well, if they're using my money,
why don't they pay me?

110
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:53,013
Well, the bank
performs a service.

111
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,016
For instance,
you could come here
and borrow money yourself.

112
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:59,352
I could come to this bank
and borrow my own money

113
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,054
and then pay them interest?

114
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:03,824
Well, yes.

115
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:05,893
Provided you have good credit.

116
00:07:07,695 --> 00:07:09,029
What that is?

117
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:14,902
that you don't need to
borrow your own money.

118
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,607
Would you like
to explain this to him?

119
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:21,909
Not on your life.

120
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:25,245
When my money is here,
who is going to be watching it?

121
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,147
Well, Mr. Harper will watch it.

122
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:28,882
Like a hawk.

123
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:32,452
Well then, I'm going to need
some references from you.

124
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,990
Balki, give him your money.

125
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:40,060
But how do I get my money
when I want to use it?

126
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:42,496
The bank gives you nice checks
with pretty little pictures.

127
00:07:42,563 --> 00:07:45,599
And when you wanna
buy something, all you have to
do is sign your name to a check.

128
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,467
That's all there is to it.

129
00:07:47,535 --> 00:07:48,936
You mean,
when I want to spend money

130
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:52,339
all I have to do
is sign my name to a check?

131
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:55,876
Let's get this done
so that we can go back to work.

132
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:01,414
Take good care of it.

133
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,750
We will.

134
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,222
A hundred
and twenty

135
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:10,891
That's what
this ordeal is about?

136
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,693
A hundred
and twenty

137
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,095
Just take the money, please.
Yes, yes.

138
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,965
If you'll just pick out
the style of checks you want,

139
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:20,568
we can wrap this up
during my lifetime.

140
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,973
Rainbows.
I love rainbows.

141
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,240
Rainbows it is.

142
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,010
Flo-o-owers.

143
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:32,145
Okay, flowers.

144
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:35,816
Puppies!

145
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:43,857
Lower.

146
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:45,959
Lower.

147
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,928
Ooh! Argh!

148
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:49,129
Lower.

149
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:53,867
Ho-ho-ho!

150
00:08:55,803 --> 00:08:58,471
Balki Claus is coming to town.

151
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,474
And what does he have?

152
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,044
An apple
for Larry Appleton.

153
00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:08,949
Where do I come up
with them?

154
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:13,754
And for you, Susan,
your favorite sugarless gum.

155
00:09:13,821 --> 00:09:16,256
Oh, thank you, Balki.

156
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:18,592
Balki, this is very nice.
What's the occasion?

157
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:21,795
Is today Mypos Apple
and Gum Day?

158
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:26,834
Ask me how I paid
for these things.

159
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,302
Balki, how did you
pay for these things?

160
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:31,071
I wrote...

161
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:32,572
Checks.

162
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:37,611
They came today.

163
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:42,650
Of course not.
Don't be ridiculous.

164
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:46,620
I also got you
this nice bug light.

165
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:48,521
Well, I'm touched.

166
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,157
Appleton, front and center!

167
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:52,726
I'm planning a real big
poker game tonight.

168
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:55,796
Oh, uh, thank you,
Mr. Twinkacetti,

169
00:09:55,863 --> 00:09:57,865
but, no, I don't play poker.

170
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:00,167
I wasn't inviting you.

171
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:07,307
Look, Appleton,
my wife hates for me to gamble.

172
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:08,608
Tonight. Got it?

173
00:10:08,676 --> 00:10:11,679
So, if it ever comes up,
I was with you.

174
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:16,950
Uh...

175
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:20,688
Hey, I'm asking
for a favor.

176
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:22,622
Man to man.

177
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,692
Men do those things
for each other.

178
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:26,559
Some men in the
Nixon White House

179
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,762
did those things
for each other.

180
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:31,398
You leave my heroes
out of this.

181
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,201
You know, lying to your wife
is really terrible.

182
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:36,937
News flash, sweet cheeks.
The ERA is dead.

183
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:39,306
You lost.
Bow and get out.

184
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:42,442
Can I be candid?

185
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,082
Now, come on, Appleton, huh?

186
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,952
It's part of the code
of the male brotherhood.

187
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,087
What is this
male brotherhood?

188
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,156
Don't worry.
No turnips allowed.

189
00:10:58,358 --> 00:10:59,960
It's okay, Balki.

190
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:05,665
Forget it,
Mr. Twinkacetti.

191
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:07,000
I won't forget this.

192
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:10,871
Oh, I just remembered.

193
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:15,108
I want you to pick it up.
Shouldn't take you
more than a whole day.

194
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,877
Mr. Twinkacetti.

195
00:11:16,944 --> 00:11:19,479
Cousin Larry has a bad back.

196
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,214
Even better.

197
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,052
Cousin,
I'll do this for you.

198
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:27,654
Don't worry. I know
the correct way to lift

199
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:29,422
without putting stress
on my back.

200
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:30,623
Ow!

201
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,459
Cousin, would you please
let me fix this?

202
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,162
No, I'm okay.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

203
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:41,268
I'm, uh, looking for
a "Balki Bartokomous."

204
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:43,603
Yeah.
That's him over there.

205
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,405
The one
who can stand erect.

206
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:49,076
BALKI:
Oh, wonderful!

207
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:50,811
My cousin
will be so happy.

208
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:54,882
Yeah, yeah,
all I want is $3028.43.

209
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:59,019
No problem.
I have checks.

210
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:12,766
♪ Touch me in the morning

211
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,237
♪ Then just walk away

212
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:21,741
♪ We don't have tomorrow... ♪

213
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,113
Twinkacetti cannot beat me.

214
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:35,889
I just moved 12 tons
of bodybuilding equipment...

215
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:38,926
By myself.

216
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:42,429
It was tough.

217
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:47,434
But I'm a better person for it.

218
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:57,610
You also look shorter.

219
00:12:57,677 --> 00:13:02,215
That's because every vertebra
in my body is compressed.

220
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:05,953
Oh, boy.

221
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:10,057
Oh, boy, oh, boy.
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

222
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:24,304
Surprise.

223
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,740
I bought you new furniture.

224
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,310
It's a present
from me to you.

225
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:53,333
Oh, I can't believe
you did this.

226
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,270
I can't believe you did this.
Oh.

227
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:01,074
I know. I can hardly
believe it myself.

228
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:09,883
Balki... Let... Let me make
something absolutely clear.

229
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,685
See, my furniture was...

230
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:15,722
Well, well...
It was my furniture.

231
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:19,626
And this furniture is not.

232
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:24,331
Oh. You don't like it?

233
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:26,967
No, no, no, it's not that
I don't like it.

234
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:31,271
Yes, it is.
I don't like it.

235
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,277
Well, but you complained
about your broken sofa

236
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:39,579
and you don't like
your old furniture

237
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:42,882
and I just wanted
to give you something.

238
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:49,522
Balki. Balki, you got rid of my
things. My things, My things!

239
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:52,259
I got it.
No, no, no, you don't got it.

240
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:55,195
You've got to understand.
Look, look.

241
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,201
I'm gonna tell you something
about my upbringing

242
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:02,835
that I've never told you.

243
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:07,607
You are?
Yes.

244
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:11,144
You told me that.

245
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:12,545
BOTH:
A lot of money.

246
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:13,880
You told me that.

247
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:15,882
We grew up
in a middle-class house...

248
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:20,287
BOTH:
In Madison, Wisconsin--

249
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:22,122
Sorry.

250
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:24,624
The point is,
with all those kids,

251
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:29,896
nothing was ever really yours.

252
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:33,133
So when I moved here,
see, I bought this furniture...

253
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,135
Well, not this furniture.

254
00:15:35,202 --> 00:15:37,170
But my own furniture.

255
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:39,572
It was used,
it was a little uncomfortable,

256
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,408
but it was all mine.

257
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:45,645
And then, tonight...
I... I come home...

258
00:15:50,017 --> 00:15:52,452
You've taken away my toys.

259
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:57,957
Oh, how sad.

260
00:15:58,025 --> 00:16:02,529
Intellectually, I know, I know.
I'm overly possessive.

261
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:04,131
Almost neurotic about it.

262
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:06,166
You are not.
I'm not?

263
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:08,935
Of course not.

264
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:11,904
Erotic?
Don't be ridiculous.

265
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:16,476
Neurotic, neurotic, neurotic!
Okay. Don't get crazy.

266
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:20,813
Wait a minute.

267
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,650
Where'd you get the money
to pay for all this stuff?

268
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:26,586
Oh, that was no problem.
I just wrote a check.

269
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:30,390
You wrote a check?
For how much?

270
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:33,160
$3028.43.

271
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:34,694
Three thou...

272
00:16:36,063 --> 00:16:37,664
Good deal, huh?

273
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:41,701
They even threw in
these plastic flowers.

274
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:43,903
Balki, Balki, Balki.

275
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:49,209
You only had $128,
less the pack of gum,
apple and bug light.

276
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:51,044
Yes, but the man
at the bank said

277
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:54,514
I can write checks for more
money than I have
as long as I...

278
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:56,549
No.
...pay it back someday.

279
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:58,085
No, no, no. No.

280
00:16:58,151 --> 00:16:59,852
That's the Money Market
Manager Account.

281
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,521
You have
the Happy Saver Account.

282
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:03,590
Don't you understand
anything about banking?

283
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:08,728
In Mypos, money
is not that important.

284
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:11,798
Two chickens is a pig,
two pigs is a cow

285
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,566
and two cows is a fortune.

286
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:19,339
You're the one that
made me go to a bank
and got me all confused.

287
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:22,242
Yeah, yeah, okay.
Oh, sure! Argh! Ooh!

288
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:25,478
Yeah, blame it on me.
Yes, why didn't I see it before?

289
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,548
Yes, it's all my fault
and I'll burn in hell for it.

290
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:31,684
Boy, you're taking this hard.

291
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:37,390
You wrote a check
for $3000 more than you have.

292
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:39,659
You don't wanna go to prison
for this furniture.

293
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:44,131
You're right.
It's my fault.

294
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:46,599
No, look, look.
It's not your fault.

295
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:50,303
I made you get that bank account
and I didn't take the time

296
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,038
to explain the basics.

297
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:56,709
It's not a big deal.

298
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:59,179
Now what did you do with it?
Oh, that's no problem.

299
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:01,348
I sold it to Mr. Twinkacetti.

300
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:05,852
You sold it to Twinkacetti?

301
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:11,158
You sold my chair, my sofa,
my coffee table, my lamp?

302
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:14,327
My rug?
You sold my lucky rug?

303
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:18,865
Is this neurotic?
Yes.

304
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,434
Yes, and so is this.

305
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:35,148
That's my lamp.

306
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:37,217
We better hustle our buttocks.

307
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:41,854
Those pinches paid off.

308
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:44,357
Good morning, turnips.
Boy, am I a lucky guy.

309
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:46,693
Last night,
I won $600 in the poker game.

310
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:49,028
And this junk
will be gone before lunch.

311
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:51,331
Mr. Twinkacetti,
I'm gonna buy back my furniture

312
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:53,366
for what you paid Balki for it.

313
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:55,368
Come on, Appleton.

314
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:57,837
You think I could sell
this elegant decor

315
00:18:57,904 --> 00:18:59,806
for a measly 75 bucks?

316
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,107
Seventy

317
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:03,676
You sold my furniture
for 75 bucks?

318
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:06,846
Well, it made sense when
Mr. Twinkacetti explained it.

319
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:08,915
I'll bet it did.

320
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,284
You can't do this to me.
It's not fair.

321
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:13,052
Oh, you're right.

322
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,255
I shouldn't take advantage
of a fellow member

323
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:21,994
of the male brotherhood.

324
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:24,431
And I owe him nothing.

325
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:27,767
Zip, as in the big O.

326
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,805
My God, my wife.

327
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:36,509
Edwina, my pet.
What a cherished moment.

328
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:43,316
Hello, Mrs. Twinkacetti.
Oh, nice to see you, Larry.

329
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:45,385
And this must be Balki.

330
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:50,890
I have heard so much about you.

331
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:53,393
Well, I have heard
so much about you too

332
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,795
and I don't
believe half of it.

333
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:02,101
We kid around.

334
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:05,137
Did you enjoy going to the
basketball game with my husband?

335
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,641
Basketball?
Loved it. Loved it.

336
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,043
Remember, turnip?
Bouncy, bouncy.

337
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,213
Why don't we step
into the office? I got
fresh coffee. We'll talk...

338
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:16,015
Balki, don't you see
what happened?

339
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:19,552
Mr. Twinkacetti told his wife
he was with you last night.

340
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,489
Oh!

341
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,991
Oh, boy.

342
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:30,797
Oh, so now I'm a member?

343
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:33,466
Are you kidding?
You're a lieutenant.

344
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:36,669
How much do you like me?

345
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,938
Like you?
I'd give you a kidney.

346
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,509
You'll cover for me,
won't you, Balki?

347
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,911
Do you mind
if I call you Turnip?

348
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,751
Watch and learn.

349
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:55,488
I'll give you $65
for this furniture, Turnip.

350
00:20:57,023 --> 00:20:58,858
Two hundred.

351
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,259
One seventy-five.

352
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:06,766
One dollar.

353
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,801
EDWINA: Donald?
Sold.

354
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:14,040
Donald, the strangest thing.

355
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:17,510
I found $600
in your office

356
00:21:17,577 --> 00:21:19,912
hidden behind
your photo of Gordon Liddy.

357
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:23,783
You should keep
your money in a bank.

358
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:28,120
Oh, I feel terrible.
I was thinking...

359
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:30,357
I was thinking
that you probably didn't go

360
00:21:30,423 --> 00:21:32,325
to a basketball game
last night.

361
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:34,160
You know,
for one crazy moment

362
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:38,130
I suspected you of playing poker
with your sleazy friends.

363
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:44,604
But I know
that couldn't be true

364
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:48,274
because our marriage
is based on mutual trust.

365
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:51,077
And if you ever
violate that trust,

366
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,580
I'll break your
chubby little legs.

367
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:00,787
We kid around.

368
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:03,423
Darling, I want you
to watch me spend your money.

369
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,392
Oh, no.
Goodbye, boys.

370
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:06,693
Bye-bye now.

371
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,663
You did good.

372
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:13,766
Thank you.
I have a dark side.

373
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,772
Well, help me
get this furniture upstairs.

374
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,842
And tonight, I'll teach you
how to balance your checkbook.

375
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:27,113
Okay. Then I teach you
how to balance a broom
on your nose.

376
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,452
Oh! Argh! Ooh!

377
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:34,554
Cousin, your back
is still hurting.

378
00:22:34,621 --> 00:22:37,390
I think it's time
I took your back by the horns.

379
00:22:37,457 --> 00:22:38,958
Oh, Balki. Whoa!

380
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,797
Balki. My back.
It doesn't hurt.

381
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:47,467
Of course not!
Balki fixed it.

382
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:49,636
Huh. That's incredible.
Yes.

383
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:52,204
Of course, sometimes
there are side effects.

384
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:55,642
Balki... I can't move my arms.

385
00:22:57,343 --> 00:22:59,512
That's one of them.

386
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:05,084
Now what?
