SAGAN: The surface of the Earth is
far more beautiful...

2
00:00:53,697 --> 00:00:57,428
...and far more intricate
than any lifeless world.

3
00:00:57,634 --> 00:00:59,829
Our planet is graced by life.

4
00:01:00,036 --> 00:01:03,767
And one quality that sets life
apart is its complexity...

5
00:01:03,974 --> 00:01:08,570
...slowly evolved through
4 billion years of natural selection.

6
00:01:11,014 --> 00:01:12,811
You can describe in detail...

7
00:01:13,016 --> 00:01:16,315
...how a rock is put together
in a single paragraph.

8
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,182
But to describe
the basic structure of a tree...

9
00:01:19,623 --> 00:01:22,217
...or a blade of grass
or even a one-celled animal...

10
00:01:22,426 --> 00:01:24,587
...you'd need many volumes.

11
00:01:24,795 --> 00:01:27,195
It takes a great deal
of information to make...

12
00:01:27,397 --> 00:01:30,992
...or even to characterize
a living thing.

13
00:01:33,637 --> 00:01:36,162
The measuring rod,
the unit of information...

14
00:01:36,373 --> 00:01:39,137
...is something called the bit.

15
00:01:39,342 --> 00:01:41,537
It's an answer, either yes or no...

16
00:01:41,745 --> 00:01:44,976
...to one unambiguously
phrased question.

17
00:01:45,182 --> 00:01:48,413
So to specify whether
a light switch is on or off...

18
00:01:48,618 --> 00:01:50,483
...requires only a single bit.

19
00:01:50,687 --> 00:01:54,817
To specify something of greater
complexity requires more bits.

20
00:01:55,025 --> 00:01:58,119
There's a popular game
called 20 Questions...

21
00:01:58,328 --> 00:02:02,264
...which shows that a great deal
can be specified in only 20 bits.

22
00:02:02,466 --> 00:02:04,058
For example...

23
00:02:04,267 --> 00:02:06,258
...I have something in my hand.

24
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:07,869
What is it?

25
00:02:08,071 --> 00:02:09,561
Is it alive? Yes.

26
00:02:09,773 --> 00:02:11,070
One bit.

27
00:02:11,274 --> 00:02:13,299
Is it an animal? Nope.

28
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,000
Two bits.

29
00:02:15,245 --> 00:02:17,805
Is it big enough to see? Yep.

30
00:02:18,281 --> 00:02:20,408
Does it grow on the land? Yes.

31
00:02:20,617 --> 00:02:23,017
Is it a cultivated plant? Nope.

32
00:02:23,487 --> 00:02:25,421
Well, with only five bits...

33
00:02:25,622 --> 00:02:28,489
...we've made substantial progress
to figuring out what it is.

34
00:02:28,692 --> 00:02:31,126
With 20 skillfully chosen questions...

35
00:02:31,328 --> 00:02:34,786
...we could easily whittle
all the cosmos down...

36
00:02:35,499 --> 00:02:37,091
...to a dandelion.

37

(BLOWS DANDELION)

38
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:58,244
In our explorations of the cosmos...

39
00:02:58,455 --> 00:03:01,549
...the first step is to ask
the right questions.

40
00:03:01,758 --> 00:03:05,455
Then, not with 20 questions,
but with billions...

41
00:03:05,662 --> 00:03:09,120
...we slowly distill from
the complexity of the universe...

42
00:03:09,332 --> 00:03:11,266
...its underlying order.

43
00:03:11,468 --> 00:03:13,993
This game has a serious purpose.

44
00:03:14,204 --> 00:03:17,173
Its name is science.

45
00:03:18,742 --> 00:03:21,609
Out here in the great cosmic dark...

46
00:03:21,811 --> 00:03:24,336
...there are countless
stars and planets...

47
00:03:24,548 --> 00:03:27,745
...some far older than
our solar system.

48
00:03:27,951 --> 00:03:31,580
Though we cannot be certain, the same
processes which led on Earth...

49
00:03:31,788 --> 00:03:33,688
...to the origin of life
and intelligence...

50

...should've been operating
throughout the cosmos.

51
00:03:36,927 --> 00:03:40,829
There may be a million worlds
in the Milky Way galaxy alone...

52
00:03:41,031 --> 00:03:42,430
...which are at this moment...

53
00:03:42,632 --> 00:03:46,363
...inhabited by other
intelligent beings.

54
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,335
What a wonder, what a joy
it would be...

55
00:03:56,546 --> 00:03:59,413
...to know something
about non-human intelligence.

56
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,140
And we can.

57
00:04:06,022 --> 00:04:08,490
Here is an exotic inhabited world...

58
00:04:08,692 --> 00:04:10,887
...mostly covered with a liquid.

59
00:04:15,865 --> 00:04:18,129
We seek the dominant intelligence...

60
00:04:18,335 --> 00:04:21,668
...that lives beneath
its fluid surface.

61
00:04:37,821 --> 00:04:41,257
This ocean of liquid water
kilometers deep...

62
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:45,019
...is teeming with strange
forms of life.

63
00:04:49,566 --> 00:04:53,195
There are communities
of transparent beings.

64
00:04:57,641 --> 00:05:00,166
There are societies of creatures
which communicate...

65
00:05:00,377 --> 00:05:03,210
...by changing the patterns
on their bodies.

66
00:05:11,221 --> 00:05:14,622
There are beings that give
off their own light.

67
00:05:22,065 --> 00:05:25,899
There are hungry flowers
that devour passersby...

68
00:05:26,102 --> 00:05:28,127
...gesticulating trees.

69
00:05:28,505 --> 00:05:31,702
All manner of creatures
that seem to violate...

70
00:05:31,908 --> 00:05:35,207
...the boundaries between
plants and animals.

71
00:05:53,763 --> 00:05:56,561
There are beings that flutter
through the ocean like...

72
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,993
...waltzing orchids.

73
00:06:16,186 --> 00:06:18,051
These are a few of the species...

74
00:06:18,254 --> 00:06:21,121
...that inhabit the water world
called Earth.

75
00:06:32,902 --> 00:06:34,335
They're packed with information.

76
00:06:34,871 --> 00:06:37,465
Each one has
a rich behavioral repertoire...

77
00:06:37,674 --> 00:06:39,767
...to ensure its own survival.

78
00:06:48,718 --> 00:06:50,948
But the grandest creatures
on the planet...

79
00:06:51,354 --> 00:06:55,085
...the intelligent and graceful
masters of the deep ocean...

80
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,088
...are the great whales.

81
00:06:57,293 --> 00:07:00,160
They are the largest animals
ever to evolve on Earth...

82
00:07:00,363 --> 00:07:03,161
...larger, by far,
than the dinosaurs.

83
00:07:03,366 --> 00:07:06,597
Their ancestors were meat-eating
mammals who migrated...

84
00:07:06,803 --> 00:07:11,240
...70 million years ago in slow steps
from the land into the waters.

85
00:07:11,474 --> 00:07:14,102
Whales, like these humpbacks,
are still mammals.

86
00:07:14,344 --> 00:07:16,369
We humans have much
in common with them.

87
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:18,240
Mothers suckle infants...

88
00:07:18,448 --> 00:07:21,110
...there's a long childhood
when adults teach the young...

89
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:24,912
...and there's a lot of play.
These are mammalian characteristics.

90
00:07:25,121 --> 00:07:27,851
Vital if an animal is to learn.

91
00:07:28,057 --> 00:07:29,854
But the sea is murky.

92
00:07:30,059 --> 00:07:31,993
The senses of sight and smell...

93
00:07:32,195 --> 00:07:33,958
...which work well for
mammals on the land...

94
00:07:34,164 --> 00:07:35,722
...are not much use here.

95
00:07:35,932 --> 00:07:38,696
So the whales evolved
an extraordinary ability...

96
00:07:38,902 --> 00:07:41,393
...to communicate by sound.

97
00:07:41,604 --> 00:07:45,404
For tens of millions of years,
the whales had no natural enemies.

98
00:07:45,608 --> 00:07:49,169
And then, a new and alien
and deadly creature...

99
00:07:49,412 --> 00:07:53,280
...suddenly appeared on the placid
surface of the ocean.

It's called the Regina Maris...

And one of its jobs is to record
the sounds of the whales.

They hunt and swim, fish...

163
00:12:18,114 --> 00:12:20,241
...browse, frolic, mate, play...

164
00:12:21,184 --> 00:12:22,845
...run from predators.

165
00:12:23,052 --> 00:12:24,952
There might be a lot to talk about.

166
00:12:40,603 --> 00:12:44,562
The great danger for the whales
is a newcomer...

167
00:12:44,774 --> 00:12:48,608
...an upstart animal only
recently through technology...

168
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:51,405
...become competent in the oceans:

169
00:12:52,782 --> 00:12:54,909
A creature called man.

170
00:12:56,185 --> 00:12:58,915
For 99.99% of the history of whales...

171
00:12:59,122 --> 00:13:01,420
...there were no humans
in the deep oceans.

172
00:13:02,024 --> 00:13:04,049
During this period,
the whales evolved...

173
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,558
...their extraordinary
communications system.

174
00:13:06,762 --> 00:13:10,892
Some whales emit extremely loud sounds
at a frequency of 20 hertz.

175
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,298
A hertz, which is spelled H-E-R-T-Z,
is a unit of sound frequency...

176
00:13:15,505 --> 00:13:20,101
...and it represents one sound wave
entering my ear every second.

177
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:22,903
A frequency of 2000 hertz sounds...

178
00:13:23,112 --> 00:13:24,841
...and looks like this.

179
00:13:25,047 --> 00:13:27,538
(HIGH PITCHED TONE)

180
00:13:28,117 --> 00:13:30,244
200 hertz, like this.

181
00:13:30,453 --> 00:13:31,681
(MEDIUM PITCHED TONE)

182
00:13:31,888 --> 00:13:33,446
And 20 hertz, like this.

183
00:13:33,656 --> 00:13:35,487
Although your TV set
may not transmit...

184
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:38,683
...sounds with frequencies
as low as 20 hertz.

185
00:13:39,729 --> 00:13:42,289
The American biologist Roger Payne
has calculated...

186
00:13:42,498 --> 00:13:46,298
...that there's a deep sound channel
in the ocean at these frequencies...

187
00:13:46,502 --> 00:13:49,164
...through which two whales
could communicate...

188
00:13:49,372 --> 00:13:50,964
...anywhere in the world.

189
00:13:51,174 --> 00:13:56,009
One whale might be off the
Ross Ice Shelf then in Antarctica...

190
00:13:56,212 --> 00:13:59,875
...and communicate with another whale
in the Aleutians in Alaska.

191
00:14:00,216 --> 00:14:03,014
For most of their history,
whales seem to have established...

192
00:14:03,219 --> 00:14:06,347
...a global communications network.

193
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:10,752
What two whales might have to say
to each other...

194
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,294
...separated by 15,000 kilometers,
I haven't the foggiest idea.

195
00:14:15,498 --> 00:14:17,898
But maybe it's a love song...

196
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,763
...cast into the vastness
of the deep.

197
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:29,038
Now, this calculation on the range
of whale communications...

198
00:14:29,245 --> 00:14:32,271
...assumes that the oceans
are quiet.

(BELL RINGS)

201
00:14:38,888 --> 00:14:41,857
But in the 19th century,
sailing ships like this one...

202
00:14:42,191 --> 00:14:44,751
...began to be replaced
by steamships...

203
00:14:44,961 --> 00:14:48,226
...another invention of those
strange land animals.

204
00:14:48,431 --> 00:14:52,197
Commercial and military vessels
became more abundant.

205
00:14:54,036 --> 00:14:56,197
The noise pollution in the sea
got much worse...

206
00:14:56,806 --> 00:14:59,900
...especially at a frequency
of 20 hertz.

(ENGINE HUMS)

208
00:15:03,613 --> 00:15:06,639
The crew of this vessel try
consciously to keep her quiet.

209
00:15:06,849 --> 00:15:07,975
But when its engine is on...

210
00:15:08,184 --> 00:15:10,744
...it gets very loud at
a frequency of 20 hertz.

211
00:15:12,455 --> 00:15:14,650
Whales communicating
across the oceans...

212
00:15:14,857 --> 00:15:17,792
...must've experienced greater
and greater difficulties.

213
00:15:17,994 --> 00:15:20,121
The distance over which
they could communicate...

214
00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:22,797
...must have steadily decreased.

215
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:25,661
Two hundred years ago...

216
00:15:25,868 --> 00:15:28,803
...a typical distance that some whales
could communicate across...

217
00:15:29,005 --> 00:15:31,974
...was perhaps 10,000 kilometers.

218
00:15:32,174 --> 00:15:34,472
Today, on a typical day...

219
00:15:34,677 --> 00:15:38,306
...the corresponding number is perhaps
a few 100 kilometers.

220
00:15:38,514 --> 00:15:41,711
We have cut off the whales
from themselves.

221
00:15:41,917 --> 00:15:44,511
Creatures which were
freely communicating...

222
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,517
...for tens of millions of years...

223
00:15:46,722 --> 00:15:49,748
...have now effectively been silenced.

224
00:15:55,564 --> 00:15:57,498
And we've done worse than that...

225
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,100
...because there persists
till this day...

226
00:16:00,303 --> 00:16:03,898
...a traffic in the dead bodies
of whales.

227
00:16:04,106 --> 00:16:07,200
There are humans who gratuitously
hunt and slaughter whales...

228
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:12,347
...and market the products
for dog food or lipstick.

229
00:16:13,249 --> 00:16:17,549
Many nations understand why
whale murder is monstrous...

230
00:16:17,753 --> 00:16:20,244
...but the traffic
continues chiefly...

231
00:16:20,456 --> 00:16:24,017
...by Japan and Norway
and the Soviet Union.

232
00:16:24,927 --> 00:16:27,122
We use "monster" to describe
an animal...

233
00:16:27,363 --> 00:16:30,526
...somehow different from us,
somehow scary.

234
00:16:31,334 --> 00:16:33,302
But who's the more monstrous...

235
00:16:33,502 --> 00:16:35,595
...the whales,
who ask to be left alone...

236
00:16:35,805 --> 00:16:38,467
...to sing their rich
and plaintive songs...

237
00:16:38,741 --> 00:16:42,700
...or the humans, who set out
to hunt them and destroy them...

238
00:16:42,912 --> 00:16:47,008
...and have brought many whale species
close to the edge of extinction?

239
00:16:49,418 --> 00:16:52,945
We're interested in communication
with extraterrestrial intelligence.

240
00:16:53,155 --> 00:16:55,055
Wouldn't a good beginning be...

241
00:16:55,257 --> 00:16:58,055
...better communication
with terrestrial intelligence...

242
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:01,627
...with other human beings
of different cultures and languages...

243
00:17:01,831 --> 00:17:04,026
...with the great apes,
with the dolphins...

244
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:06,724
...but particularly with the whales?

245
00:17:35,731 --> 00:17:39,326
To survive, a whale must
know how to do things.

246
00:17:39,535 --> 00:17:41,969
This knowledge is stored
in two principal ways...

247
00:17:42,171 --> 00:17:45,766
...in the whale's genes
and in their very large brains.

248
00:17:45,975 --> 00:17:47,840
We can think of their
genes and brains...

249
00:17:48,043 --> 00:17:50,944
...as something like libraries
inside their bodies.

250
00:17:51,147 --> 00:17:53,911
The information in the DNA,
the genetic information...

251
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:55,913
...includes how to nurse...

252
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:58,279
...how to convert
shrimp into blubber...

253
00:17:58,487 --> 00:18:02,423
...how to hold your breath on a dive
one kilometer below the surface.

254
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:05,458
The information in the brains,
the learned information...

255
00:18:05,661 --> 00:18:07,219
...involves such things as...

256
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,488
...who's your mother...

257
00:18:08,697 --> 00:18:12,155
...or what the meaning is of
that song we're hearing just now.

258
00:18:15,337 --> 00:18:18,329
The gene library
of whales and people...

259
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,031
...and everybody else on Earth...

260
00:18:20,242 --> 00:18:21,834
...is made of DNA.

261
00:18:22,044 --> 00:18:24,137
The only function
of this complex molecule...

262
00:18:24,346 --> 00:18:28,180
...is to store and copy information.

263
00:18:32,188 --> 00:18:36,147
We see here the set of instructions
in human DNA...

264
00:18:36,358 --> 00:18:41,022
...written in a language billions
of years older than any human tongue.

265
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,164
Each colored cluster of atoms...

266
00:18:43,365 --> 00:18:46,801
...is a letter in the genetic alphabet:
The language of life.

267
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:48,469
There are billions of letters...

268
00:18:48,671 --> 00:18:51,936
...many billions of bits
of information.

269
00:18:52,441 --> 00:18:54,568
If you came from somewhere
very different...

270
00:18:54,777 --> 00:18:57,837
...you wouldn't be able
to specify a whale or a person...

271
00:18:58,047 --> 00:19:01,483
...in a game of 20 Questions
with only 20 bits.

272
00:19:01,684 --> 00:19:05,085
But a game called
10 Billion Questions...

273
00:19:05,287 --> 00:19:06,982
...might just work.

274
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:08,520
Every organism on Earth...

275
00:19:08,724 --> 00:19:11,488
...contains as its
inheritance and legacy...

276
00:19:11,694 --> 00:19:13,559
...a portable library.

277
00:19:13,762 --> 00:19:18,131
And the more bits of information
you have, the more you can do.

278
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,965
The simplest organism, a virus...

279
00:19:24,173 --> 00:19:26,403
...needs only about 10,000 bits.

280
00:19:26,609 --> 00:19:30,670
Equal to the amount of information
on one page of an average book.

281
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,609
These are all the instructions
it needs...

282
00:19:32,815 --> 00:19:35,648
...to infect some other organism
and to reproduce itself...

283
00:19:35,851 --> 00:19:39,252
...which are the only things
that viruses are any good at.

284
00:19:39,455 --> 00:19:42,982
A bacterium uses roughly
a million bits of information...

285
00:19:43,192 --> 00:19:44,955
...about 100 printed pages.

286
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,424
Bacteria have a lot more
to do than viruses.

287
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:52,158
They're not thoroughgoing parasites.
Bacteria have to make a living.

288
00:19:55,905 --> 00:19:59,033
What about a free-swimming
one-celled amoeba?

289
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:01,505
These creatures are
also microscopic...

290
00:20:01,977 --> 00:20:04,138
...but in the realm
of one-celled animals...

291
00:20:04,346 --> 00:20:05,779
...they are giants.

292
00:20:05,981 --> 00:20:09,007
The whales of the microbial world.

293
00:20:09,218 --> 00:20:13,746
Each contains about 400 million bits
in its DNA...

294
00:20:13,956 --> 00:20:18,017
...the equivalent of about
80 volumes of 500 pages each.

295
00:20:18,227 --> 00:20:20,855
That's how much information
it takes to make an amoeba...

296
00:20:21,063 --> 00:20:26,000
...a creature like a small city
wandering through a drop of water.

297
00:20:29,772 --> 00:20:31,933
And what about a whale
or a human being?

298
00:20:32,141 --> 00:20:34,006
Well, the answer seems to be...

299
00:20:34,209 --> 00:20:38,077
...that there's 5 billion bits.

300
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,307
Five billion bits of information
in our encyclopedia of life...

301
00:20:42,518 --> 00:20:45,385
...in the nucleus of every one
of our cells.

302
00:20:45,588 --> 00:20:49,149
So if written out in,
say, ordinary English...

303
00:20:49,358 --> 00:20:51,986
...those instructions,
that information...

304
00:20:52,194 --> 00:20:56,062
...would fill 1000 volumes.

305
00:20:56,265 --> 00:20:57,357
Think of it.

306
00:20:57,566 --> 00:21:01,798
In every one of the 100 trillion
cells in your body...

307
00:21:02,004 --> 00:21:04,973
...there's the contents of a complete
library of instructions...

308
00:21:05,174 --> 00:21:09,167
...on how to make every part of you.
Those cells are smart.

309
00:21:09,378 --> 00:21:11,869
If this were my gene library...

310
00:21:12,081 --> 00:21:14,982
...it would contain everything
my body knows how to do...

311
00:21:15,184 --> 00:21:16,913
...without being taught.

312
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:19,917
The ancient information...

313
00:21:20,122 --> 00:21:24,957
...is written in exhaustive,
careful, redundant detail.

314
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,823
How to laugh, how to sneeze,
how to walk...

315
00:21:29,031 --> 00:21:31,431
...how to recognize patterns,
how to reproduce...

316
00:21:31,634 --> 00:21:33,693
...how to digest an apple.

317
00:21:34,203 --> 00:21:36,865
If written out in
the language of chemistry...

318
00:21:37,072 --> 00:21:38,630
...what would the instructions...

319
00:21:38,841 --> 00:21:41,571
...for digesting the sugar
in an apple look like?

320
00:21:41,777 --> 00:21:43,802
Well, let's see.

321
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,508
Amino acid synthesis,
polypeptide chains...

322
00:21:47,716 --> 00:21:52,050
...transfer RNA, genetic code,
enzyme expression...

323
00:21:52,254 --> 00:21:54,814
...enzyme phosphorylation.
We're getting warm.

324
00:21:55,024 --> 00:21:58,892
Hexose monophosphate shunt,
citric acid cycle...

325
00:21:59,094 --> 00:22:01,654
Here we are.
Anaerobic glycolysis.

326
00:22:01,864 --> 00:22:03,491
Now, eating an apple...

327
00:22:03,699 --> 00:22:06,259
...may seem like
a very simple thing...

328
00:22:07,002 --> 00:22:08,731
...but it's not.

329
00:22:08,937 --> 00:22:12,839
In fact, if I consciously had to
remember and direct...

330
00:22:13,042 --> 00:22:17,376
...all the chemical steps required to
get energy out of food...

331
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:19,740
...I?d probably starve to death.

332
00:22:19,948 --> 00:22:24,715
And yet, even a bacterium
can do anaerobic glycolysis.

333
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:29,857
That's why apples rot.
It's lunchtime for the bacteria.

334
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:33,586
They and we and all
the creatures in between...

335
00:22:33,796 --> 00:22:37,095
...possess similar
genetic instructions.

336
00:22:37,299 --> 00:22:39,790
Our separate gene libraries...

337
00:22:40,002 --> 00:22:42,732
...have many pages in common...

338
00:22:42,938 --> 00:22:46,032
...which is another reminder
of the deep interconnection...

339
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:48,937
...of all living things
on our planet because of...

340
00:22:49,144 --> 00:22:51,169
...a common evolutionary heritage.

341
00:22:54,016 --> 00:22:56,541
Our present human technology...

342
00:22:56,752 --> 00:23:01,655
...can duplicate only a tiny fraction
of the intricate biochemistry...

343
00:23:01,857 --> 00:23:06,089
...which our bodies seem
to perform so effortlessly.

344
00:23:06,295 --> 00:23:08,855
But we're just beginning
the study of biochemistry.

345
00:23:09,064 --> 00:23:13,228
Evolution has had
billions of years of practice.

346
00:23:14,203 --> 00:23:16,637
The DNA knows.

347
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,436
Now, what if what we had
to do was so complicated...

348
00:23:22,644 --> 00:23:26,671
...that even several billion bits
of information wasn't enough?

349
00:23:26,882 --> 00:23:30,374
What if, for example, the environment
were changing so fast...

350
00:23:30,586 --> 00:23:34,044
...that the pre-coded
genetic encyclopedia...

351
00:23:34,256 --> 00:23:37,714
...which may have served us perfectly
well in the past is now...

352
00:23:37,926 --> 00:23:41,020
...not perfectly adequate?

353
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,788
Why, then...

354
00:23:42,998 --> 00:23:47,264
...even a gene library of
1000 volumes wouldn't be enough.

355
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:50,666
That's why we have brains.

356
00:23:54,143 --> 00:23:56,407
Like our other organs,
the brain has evolved...

357
00:23:56,612 --> 00:23:59,080
...increasing over millions of years...

358
00:23:59,281 --> 00:24:02,273
...in complexity
and information content.

359
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:06,921
Its structure reflects all the stages
through which it has passed.

360
00:24:07,356 --> 00:24:12,055
The brain has evolved
from the inside out.

361
00:24:12,261 --> 00:24:15,890
Deep inside is the oldest part,
the so-called brain stem.

362
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:19,126
It conducts many of the basic
biological functions...

363
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:21,768
...including the rhythms of life...

364
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,803
...like heartbeat and respiration.

365
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:27,976
The higher functions
of the brain have evolved...

366
00:24:28,177 --> 00:24:31,738
...in three successive stages
according to a provocative insight...

367
00:24:31,947 --> 00:24:34,780
...by the American biologist
Paul MacLean.

368
00:24:34,983 --> 00:24:39,317
You see, capping the brain stem is
the so-called R-complex...

369
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:41,284
"R" for reptile.

370
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:43,219
It's the seat of...

371
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:46,655
...aggression, ritual,
territoriality...

372
00:24:46,862 --> 00:24:48,727
...and social hierarchies.

373
00:24:48,931 --> 00:24:52,094
It evolved some hundreds of millions
of years ago...

374
00:24:52,301 --> 00:24:54,599
...in our reptilian ancestors.

375
00:24:54,803 --> 00:24:59,570
So, deep inside our brains
is something rather like...

376
00:24:59,775 --> 00:25:02,073
...the brain of a crocodile.

377
00:25:02,277 --> 00:25:05,940
Surrounding the R-complex is
the limbic system...

378
00:25:06,148 --> 00:25:07,376
...or mammal brain.

379
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:09,881
It evolved some tens of millions
of years ago...

380
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:12,810
...in ancestors who were
mammals all right...

381
00:25:13,021 --> 00:25:17,458
...but not yet primates
like monkeys or apes.

382
00:25:17,659 --> 00:25:21,220
It's a major source
of our moods and emotions...

383
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:24,729
...our concern and care
for the young.

384
00:25:24,933 --> 00:25:28,767
And then, finally,
on the outside of the brain...

385
00:25:29,371 --> 00:25:32,431
...living in a kind of
uneasy truce with...

386
00:25:32,641 --> 00:25:36,338
...the more primitive brains beneath,
is the cerebral cortex...

387
00:25:36,545 --> 00:25:38,945
...evolved millions of years ago...

388
00:25:39,147 --> 00:25:41,638
...in ancestors who were primates.

389
00:25:54,963 --> 00:25:57,431
This is the point of embarkation...

390
00:25:57,633 --> 00:25:59,726
...for all our cosmic journeys.

391
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:01,630
The cerebral cortex...

392
00:26:01,837 --> 00:26:05,034
...where matter is transformed
into consciousness.

393
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,540
Here, comprising more than
two-thirds of the brain mass...

394
00:26:09,745 --> 00:26:13,545
...is the realm both of intuition
and of critical analysis.

395
00:26:13,749 --> 00:26:16,946
It's here that we have
ideas and inspirations.

396
00:26:17,152 --> 00:26:18,915
Here that we read and write.

397
00:26:19,121 --> 00:26:22,454
Here that we do mathematics and music.

398
00:26:22,658 --> 00:26:26,355
The cortex regulates
our conscious lives.

399
00:26:26,561 --> 00:26:29,496
It is the distinction
of our species...

400
00:26:29,698 --> 00:26:31,689
...the seat of our humanity.

401
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,164
Art and science live here.

402
00:26:34,369 --> 00:26:38,271
Civilization is a product
of the cerebral cortex.

403
00:26:40,876 --> 00:26:42,002
Behind the forehead...

404
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:45,145
...are the frontal lobes
of the cerebral cortex.

405
00:26:45,347 --> 00:26:47,907
They may be where we
anticipate events...

406
00:26:48,116 --> 00:26:50,346
...where we figure out the future.

407
00:26:50,552 --> 00:26:52,782
But if we can foresee
an unpleasant future...

408
00:26:52,988 --> 00:26:54,922
...we can take steps to avoid it.

409
00:26:55,123 --> 00:26:57,148
Down here in the frontal lobes...

410
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:59,919
...may be the means
of ensuring human survival...

411
00:27:00,128 --> 00:27:02,858
...if we have the wisdom
to pay attention.

412
00:27:05,801 --> 00:27:10,238
Inside the cerebral cortex is
the microscopic structure of thought.

413
00:27:10,439 --> 00:27:14,034
The language of the brain is not
the DNA language of the genes.

414
00:27:14,242 --> 00:27:17,769
What we know is encoded
in cells called neurons...

415
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,311
...tiny switching elements...

416
00:27:19,514 --> 00:27:23,314
...every connection representing
one bit of information.

417
00:27:23,518 --> 00:27:26,715
How many neurons do each of us have?
Maybe 100 billion.

418
00:27:26,922 --> 00:27:30,221
Comparable to the number of stars
in the Milky Way galaxy.

419
00:27:30,425 --> 00:27:34,953
And there are something like
100 trillion neural connections.

420
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:41,366
This intricate and marvelous
network of neurons...

421
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:45,336
...has been called
an enchanted loom...

422
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,338
...where millions of
flashing shuttles...

423
00:27:48,543 --> 00:27:51,239
...weave a dissolving pattern.

424
00:27:51,446 --> 00:27:55,007
Even in sleep, the brain is pulsing
and throbbing and flashing...

425
00:27:55,217 --> 00:27:58,118
...with the complex business
of human life:

426
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,346
Dreaming, remembering,
figuring things out.

427
00:28:01,556 --> 00:28:04,684
Our thoughts, our visions,
our fantasies...

428
00:28:04,893 --> 00:28:07,885
...have a tangible, physical reality.

429
00:28:08,096 --> 00:28:09,893
What does a thought look like?

430
00:28:10,098 --> 00:28:14,034
Well, it's made of hundreds
of electrochemical impulses.

431
00:28:14,836 --> 00:28:16,497
Over there, for example, is...

432
00:28:16,705 --> 00:28:18,104
...a spark of a memory.

433
00:28:18,306 --> 00:28:19,568
Maybe...

434
00:28:19,775 --> 00:28:23,734
...the smell of lilacs on a country
road in childhood.

435
00:28:23,945 --> 00:28:28,279
And there goes a bit of
an anxious all points bulletin.

436
00:28:28,483 --> 00:28:31,975
Perhaps, "Where did I leave my keys? "

437
00:28:34,689 --> 00:28:37,817
The neurons store sounds too...

438
00:28:38,026 --> 00:28:39,823
...and snatches of music.

439
00:28:40,028 --> 00:28:44,362
Whole orchestras play
inside our heads.

440
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:54,037
The landscape of the human
cerebral cortex is deeply furrowed.

441
00:28:54,242 --> 00:28:55,675
There's a good reason for it.

442
00:28:55,877 --> 00:28:57,367
These convolutions...

443
00:28:57,579 --> 00:29:01,572
...greatly increase the surface area
available for information storage...

444
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:05,082
...in a skull of limited size.

445
00:29:09,424 --> 00:29:12,587
The world of thought is
divided into two hemispheres.

446
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:15,524
Over there is the right hemisphere
of the cerebral cortex.

447
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:18,392
It's mainly responsible
for pattern recognition...

448
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,694
...intuition, sensitivity,
creative insights.

449
00:29:21,903 --> 00:29:24,098
And over here is
the left hemisphere...

450
00:29:24,306 --> 00:29:28,470
...presiding over rational, analytic
and critical thinking.

451
00:29:34,049 --> 00:29:37,143
These are the two sides...

452
00:29:37,352 --> 00:29:41,379
...the dual strengths,
the essential opposites...

453
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:43,558
...that characterize human thinking.

454
00:29:43,758 --> 00:29:46,318
Before us are the means...

455
00:29:46,528 --> 00:29:50,589
...both for generating ideas
and for testing their validity.

456
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:55,099
There's a continuous dialogue between
the two hemispheres of the brain...

457
00:29:55,303 --> 00:29:59,672
...channeled through this immense
bundle of nerve fibers...

458
00:29:59,875 --> 00:30:02,639
...which is called
the corpus callosum.

459
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:07,178
It's a bridge between
creativity and analysis...

460
00:30:07,382 --> 00:30:11,443
...both of which are necessary
if we are to understand the world.

461
00:30:12,988 --> 00:30:16,890
The information content of
the human brain expressed in bits...

462
00:30:17,092 --> 00:30:19,458
...is comparable to the number
of connections between...

463
00:30:19,661 --> 00:30:21,128
...the neurons in the cortex...

464
00:30:21,329 --> 00:30:23,229
...about 100 trillion bits...

465
00:30:23,431 --> 00:30:26,229
...10 to the 14th connections.

466
00:30:26,434 --> 00:30:29,892
If written out in English,
it would fill 20 million volumes...

467
00:30:30,105 --> 00:30:32,573
...as many as in the
world's largest libraries.

468
00:30:32,774 --> 00:30:36,335
The equivalent of 20 million volumes
worth of information...

469
00:30:36,545 --> 00:30:38,911
...is inside the heads
of every one of us.

470
00:30:39,114 --> 00:30:43,847
The brain is a very big place
in a very small space.

471
00:30:45,921 --> 00:30:50,381
Most of the books in the brain are
up here in the cerebral cortex.

472
00:30:50,592 --> 00:30:53,493
Down there, in the basement
of the brain...

473
00:30:53,695 --> 00:30:55,720
...are the functions
that our ancestors...

474
00:30:55,931 --> 00:30:57,922
...mainly depended on for survival:

475
00:30:58,133 --> 00:31:01,125
Aggression, child rearing, sex...

476
00:31:01,336 --> 00:31:03,827
...the willingness to
follow leaders blindly.

477
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:07,440
Lots of things that we can still
recognize in our lives today.

478
00:31:07,642 --> 00:31:09,735
Of the higher brain functions...

479
00:31:09,945 --> 00:31:11,572
...some of them, like...

480
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,805
...reading, writing, speaking...

481
00:31:14,015 --> 00:31:18,918
...seem to be located in particular
places in the cerebral cortex.

482
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,315
On the other hand, each memory...

483
00:31:21,523 --> 00:31:25,926
...seems to be stored in many
separate locales in the brain.

484
00:31:26,127 --> 00:31:28,823
Old memories are in lots of places.

485
00:31:35,704 --> 00:31:37,535
Here is one of my earliest memories.

(POURS LIQUID)

487
00:31:46,881 --> 00:31:48,143
MOTHER:
That's a good boy.

488
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:50,682
Lunch is almost ready.

(CLICKS ON RADIO)

490
00:31:56,057 --> 00:31:59,424
(MUSIC PLAYS)

491
00:32:13,975 --> 00:32:16,170
That was a long time ago.

492
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:20,875
But its imprint has not faded...

493
00:32:21,082 --> 00:32:24,051
...in the library of this brain.

494
00:32:31,593 --> 00:32:34,926
But the brain does much more
than just recollect.

495
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:36,358
It inter-compares.

496
00:32:36,564 --> 00:32:38,964
It synthesizes. It analyzes.

497
00:32:39,167 --> 00:32:41,635
It generates abstractions.

498
00:32:46,775 --> 00:32:49,505
The simplest thought,
like the concept of the number one...

499
00:32:49,711 --> 00:32:52,009
...has an elaborate,
logical underpinning.

500
00:32:52,213 --> 00:32:53,874
The brain has its own language...

501
00:32:54,082 --> 00:32:56,949
...for testing the world's
structure and consistency.

502
00:32:57,152 --> 00:32:59,712
But we never see the machinery
of logical analysis...

503
00:32:59,921 --> 00:33:01,752
...only the conclusions.

504
00:33:03,658 --> 00:33:06,388
There is so much more
that we must figure out...

505
00:33:06,594 --> 00:33:08,255
...than the genes can know.

506
00:33:08,463 --> 00:33:10,897
That's why the brain library...

507
00:33:11,099 --> 00:33:14,535
...has 10,000 times
more information in it...

508
00:33:14,736 --> 00:33:16,169
...than the gene library.

509
00:33:16,371 --> 00:33:21,070
Our passion for learning is
the tool for our survival.

510
00:33:26,348 --> 00:33:30,284
And unlike the musty bindings
of our gene library...

511
00:33:30,485 --> 00:33:32,919
...in which hardly a word
changes in a century...

512
00:33:33,121 --> 00:33:36,784
...the brain library is
made of loose-leaf books.

513
00:33:36,991 --> 00:33:40,950
We're constantly adding
new pages and new volumes.

514
00:33:49,037 --> 00:33:52,700
Emotions and ritual
behavior patterns...

515
00:33:52,907 --> 00:33:54,704
...are built very deeply into us.

516
00:33:54,909 --> 00:33:57,810
They're part of our humanity.

517
00:33:58,012 --> 00:34:00,572
But they're not
characteristically human.

518
00:34:00,782 --> 00:34:02,773
Many other animals have feelings.

519
00:34:02,984 --> 00:34:06,613
What distinguishes our
species is thought.

520
00:34:06,821 --> 00:34:11,690
The cerebral cortex is,
in a way, a liberation.

521
00:34:11,893 --> 00:34:14,020
We need no longer be trapped...

522
00:34:14,229 --> 00:34:17,255
...in the genetically inherited
behavior patterns...

523
00:34:17,465 --> 00:34:19,797
...of lizards and baboons:

524
00:34:20,001 --> 00:34:22,629
Territoriality and aggression...

525
00:34:22,837 --> 00:34:25,237
...and dominance hierarchies.

526
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,907
We are, each of us...

527
00:34:27,108 --> 00:34:30,635
...largely responsible for what
gets put into our brains...

528
00:34:30,845 --> 00:34:35,043
...for what, as adults,
we wind up caring for...

529
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,842
...and knowing about.

530
00:34:37,051 --> 00:34:40,077
No longer at the mercy
of the reptile brain...

531
00:34:40,288 --> 00:34:43,689
...we can change ourselves.

532
00:34:43,892 --> 00:34:46,156
Think of the possibilities.

533
00:35:17,792 --> 00:35:19,783
The city, like the brain...

534
00:35:19,994 --> 00:35:22,462
...has evolved in successive stages.

535
00:35:22,664 --> 00:35:25,462
The vestiges of its past are
still retained...

536
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:28,966
...among the constructions
of the present.

537
00:35:37,278 --> 00:35:40,111
A city like New York developed
from a small center...

538
00:35:40,315 --> 00:35:44,251
...and slowly grew leaving many
of the old parts still functioning.

539
00:35:44,452 --> 00:35:47,421
Some of the major streets
date to the 17th century.

540
00:35:47,622 --> 00:35:50,250
Its commercial hub,
to the 18th century.

541
00:35:50,458 --> 00:35:52,824
The water and gas works,
to the 19th.

542
00:35:53,027 --> 00:35:57,327
The electrical and communications
systems, to the 20th century.

543
00:36:07,675 --> 00:36:10,667
The city has evolved
much faster than the brain.

544
00:36:10,879 --> 00:36:12,744
Only 10,000 years ago...

545
00:36:12,947 --> 00:36:15,177
...the human brain looked exactly
as it does today...

546
00:36:15,383 --> 00:36:16,850
...and we were just as smart.

547
00:36:17,051 --> 00:36:18,450
But there were no cities...

548
00:36:18,653 --> 00:36:23,454
...only a few scattered encampments
in the vast primordial forests.

549
00:36:23,658 --> 00:36:25,455
Today, it's just the opposite.

550
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:30,597
Forests and grasslands often seem like
scattered islands in a sea of cities.

551
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:34,360
If you were an observer
from an alien world...

552
00:36:34,569 --> 00:36:36,730
...you would've noticed that
something complicated...

553
00:36:36,938 --> 00:36:39,930
...has been happening
over the last few thousand years.

554
00:36:40,141 --> 00:36:43,008
It might take you a while
to figure out the details...

555
00:36:43,211 --> 00:36:45,611
...but you would recognize
by its complexity...

556
00:36:45,813 --> 00:36:48,611
...unmistakable evidence
for intelligent life.

557
00:36:49,617 --> 00:36:51,676
On closer scrutiny,
you might recognize...

558
00:36:51,886 --> 00:36:53,615
...individual, intelligent beings.

559
00:36:59,761 --> 00:37:03,458
The evolution of the city is due
to their conscious activity.

560
00:37:04,065 --> 00:37:07,523
Millions of human beings working,
more or less, together...

561
00:37:07,735 --> 00:37:10,499
...to preserve the city,
to reconstruct it...

562
00:37:10,705 --> 00:37:12,195
...and to change it.

563
00:37:25,787 --> 00:37:28,756
It might be more efficient
if all civic systems...

564
00:37:28,957 --> 00:37:31,721
...were periodically replaced
from top to bottom.

565
00:37:31,926 --> 00:37:33,621
But, as in the brain...

566
00:37:33,828 --> 00:37:36,661
...everything has to work
during the renovation.

567
00:37:36,864 --> 00:37:38,764
So the city mostly adds new parts...

568
00:37:38,967 --> 00:37:42,698
...while the old parts continue,
more or less, to function.

569
00:37:45,907 --> 00:37:48,068
For example, in the 17th century...

570
00:37:48,276 --> 00:37:50,437
...you traveled between
Brooklyn and Manhattan...

571
00:37:50,645 --> 00:37:52,875
...across the East River by ferry.

572
00:37:53,081 --> 00:37:56,608
In the 19th century, the technology
became available to construct...

573
00:37:56,818 --> 00:37:58,615
...a suspension bridge
across the river.

574
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,846
It was built precisely at the site
of the ferry terminal...

575
00:38:02,056 --> 00:38:05,753
...because major thoroughfares
were already converging there.

576
00:38:06,995 --> 00:38:10,123
When it was possible to construct
a tunnel under the river...

577
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:14,631
...that, too, was built in the same
place and for the same reason.

578
00:38:14,836 --> 00:38:18,602
This use and restructuring of
previous systems for new purposes...

579
00:38:18,806 --> 00:38:22,207
...is very much like the pattern
of biological evolution.

580
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:24,844
Or consider Third Avenue.

581
00:38:25,046 --> 00:38:26,536
In the 17th century...

582
00:38:26,748 --> 00:38:30,616
...you made your way uptown
on foot or on horseback.

583
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,849
A little later, there were coaches...

584
00:38:34,055 --> 00:38:37,456
...the horses prancing,
the coachmen cracking their whips.

585
00:38:38,059 --> 00:38:41,722
And then these were replaced
by horse-drawn trolleys...

586
00:38:41,929 --> 00:38:45,296
...clanging along fixed tracks
on this avenue.

587
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,991
Then electrical technology
developed...

588
00:38:48,202 --> 00:38:51,831
...and a great elevated railway line
was constructed...

589
00:38:52,807 --> 00:38:56,607
...called the Third Avenue El,
which dominated the street...

590
00:38:56,811 --> 00:39:01,180
...until 1954, when it was
utterly demolished.

591
00:39:01,382 --> 00:39:06,319
Anyway, the El was then replaced
by buses and taxicabs...

592
00:39:06,587 --> 00:39:08,817
...which still are the main forms...

593
00:39:09,023 --> 00:39:11,253
...of public transportation
on Third Avenue.

594
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:15,154
Now as gasoline becomes
a rare commodity...

595
00:39:15,363 --> 00:39:18,890
...the combustion engine will be
replaced by something else.

596
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:24,037
Maybe public transport
on Third Avenue in the 21st century...

597
00:39:24,572 --> 00:39:29,305
...will be by, I don't know,
pneumatic tubes or electric cars.

598
00:39:30,111 --> 00:39:34,377
Every step in the evolution
of Third Avenue transport...

599
00:39:34,582 --> 00:39:36,777
...has been conservative...

600
00:39:36,984 --> 00:39:39,145
...following a route
first laid down...

601
00:39:39,353 --> 00:39:41,116
...in the 17th century.

602
00:39:41,322 --> 00:39:45,418
But the brain is still more
conservative than the city.

603
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:49,460
If this were the brain, we might have
horse-drawn trolleys...

604
00:39:49,664 --> 00:39:51,359
...and the El and buses...

605
00:39:51,566 --> 00:39:54,057
...all operating simultaneously...

606
00:39:54,268 --> 00:39:56,793
...redundantly, competitively.

607
00:39:57,004 --> 00:39:59,871
The vestiges of earlier history
clearly in evidence.

608
00:40:10,952 --> 00:40:13,386
When our genes could not store...

609
00:40:13,588 --> 00:40:16,318
...all the information necessary
for our survival...

610
00:40:16,524 --> 00:40:19,687
...we slowly invented brains.

611
00:40:20,428 --> 00:40:25,058
But then the time came, maybe
tens of thousands of years ago...

612
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:27,460
...when we needed to know more than...

613
00:40:27,668 --> 00:40:30,068
...could conveniently be stored
in brains.

614
00:40:33,841 --> 00:40:38,073
So we learned to stockpile
enormous quantities of information...

615
00:40:38,279 --> 00:40:39,769
...outside our bodies.

616
00:40:39,981 --> 00:40:42,950
We are the only species on Earth,
so far as we know...

617
00:40:43,151 --> 00:40:46,177
...to have invented
a communal memory.

618
00:40:46,387 --> 00:40:49,982
The warehouse of that memory
is called the library.

619
00:40:52,693 --> 00:40:54,524
Libraries also have evolved.

620
00:40:54,729 --> 00:40:56,924
The Assyrian library
of Ashurbanipal...

621
00:40:57,131 --> 00:40:59,463
...had thousands of clay tablets.

622
00:40:59,667 --> 00:41:02,568
The celebrated Library of Alexandria
in Egypt...

623
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:05,898
...consisted of almost
a million papyrus scrolls.

624
00:41:06,107 --> 00:41:09,406
Great modern libraries,
like the New York Public Library...

625
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:12,602
...contain some 10 million books.

626
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:20,087
That's more than 10 to the 14th bits
of information in words.

627
00:41:20,288 --> 00:41:24,315
More than 100 trillion bits,
and if we count pictures...

628
00:41:24,525 --> 00:41:28,552
...it's something like 10 to the 15th
bits of information.

629
00:41:28,763 --> 00:41:30,924
Now, that's more than 10,000 times...

630
00:41:31,132 --> 00:41:34,192
...the total number of bits
of information in our genes.

631
00:41:34,402 --> 00:41:35,960
Something like 10 times...

632
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:39,571
...the total amount of information
in our brains.

633
00:41:39,774 --> 00:41:42,436
If I were to read a book a week...

634
00:41:42,643 --> 00:41:45,339
...for my entire adult lifetime...

635
00:41:45,546 --> 00:41:47,514
...and I lived an ordinary lifetime...

636
00:41:47,715 --> 00:41:48,943
...when I was all done...

637
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:52,642
...I would've read maybe
a few thousand books.

638
00:41:52,854 --> 00:41:54,116
No more.

639
00:41:54,322 --> 00:41:58,986
In this library,
that's from about here...

640
00:42:04,298 --> 00:42:05,731
...roughly...

641
00:42:07,435 --> 00:42:09,926
...to about here.

642
00:42:10,137 --> 00:42:13,197
But that's only
a 10th of a percent or so...

643
00:42:13,407 --> 00:42:16,103
...of the total number of books
in the library.

644
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:20,440
The trick is to know
which books to read.

645
00:42:22,316 --> 00:42:24,876
But they're all here.

646
00:42:34,195 --> 00:42:38,222
What an astonishing thing a book is.

647
00:42:38,432 --> 00:42:41,924
It's a flat object made from a tree...

648
00:42:42,136 --> 00:42:46,573
...with flexible parts
on which are imprinted...

649
00:42:46,774 --> 00:42:49,709
...lots of funny dark squiggles.

650
00:42:49,911 --> 00:42:52,141
But one glance at it...

651
00:42:52,346 --> 00:42:55,179
...and you're inside
the mind of another person.

652
00:42:55,383 --> 00:42:59,114
Maybe somebody dead
for thousands of years.

653
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,288
Across the millennia...

654
00:43:01,489 --> 00:43:05,016
...an author is speaking
clearly and silently...

655
00:43:05,226 --> 00:43:08,127
...inside your head, directly to you.

656
00:43:08,329 --> 00:43:12,322
Writing is perhaps the greatest
of human inventions.

657
00:43:12,533 --> 00:43:15,468
Binding together people
who never knew each other.

658
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:18,434
Citizens of distant epochs.

659
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:22,006
Books break the shackles of time.

660
00:43:22,209 --> 00:43:27,146
A book is proof that humans
are capable of working magic.

661
00:43:27,415 --> 00:43:30,748
And this room is filled with magic.

662
00:43:32,954 --> 00:43:36,014
Some of the earliest
authors wrote on...

663
00:43:36,657 --> 00:43:39,683
...bones and stones.

664
00:43:39,894 --> 00:43:44,194
Cuneiform writing is the remote
ancestor of the Western alphabet.

665
00:43:44,398 --> 00:43:48,300
It was invented in the Near East
about 5000 years ago.

666
00:43:48,502 --> 00:43:50,129
Its purpose?

667
00:43:50,338 --> 00:43:51,430
To keep records.

668
00:43:51,639 --> 00:43:55,336
Records of the purchase of grain,
the sale of land...

669
00:43:55,543 --> 00:43:59,343
...the triumphs of kings,
the statutes of priests...

670
00:43:59,547 --> 00:44:01,708
...the positions of the stars...

671
00:44:01,916 --> 00:44:04,714
...the prayers to the gods.

672
00:44:04,919 --> 00:44:07,683
This cone was made...

673
00:44:07,888 --> 00:44:10,379
...around the year 2350 B.C.

674
00:44:10,591 --> 00:44:14,721
4300 years ago, there were people
chipping and chiseling away...

675
00:44:14,929 --> 00:44:16,487
...the message on this cone.

676
00:44:16,697 --> 00:44:18,494
What is that message?

677
00:44:18,699 --> 00:44:20,496
It's a prayer.

678
00:44:20,701 --> 00:44:24,159
The inscription on this cylinder...

679
00:44:25,172 --> 00:44:27,436
...honors a king.

680
00:44:27,975 --> 00:44:32,309
Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon,
in the 6th century B.C.

681
00:44:32,513 --> 00:44:36,176
For thousands of years, writing was
chiseled into stone...

682
00:44:36,384 --> 00:44:40,411
...scratched onto wax
or bark or leather...

683
00:44:40,621 --> 00:44:44,523
...painted on bamboo
or silk or paper...

684
00:44:44,725 --> 00:44:47,922
...but always in editions of one copy.

685
00:44:48,129 --> 00:44:49,960
One copy at a time...

686
00:44:50,164 --> 00:44:53,759
...always, except for
inscriptions on monuments...

687
00:44:53,968 --> 00:44:56,027
...for a tiny readership.

688
00:45:09,116 --> 00:45:12,415
But then in China...

689
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:15,350
...between the 2nd
and the 6th centuries...

690
00:45:15,556 --> 00:45:19,515
...paper, ink and printing
with carved wooden blocks...

691
00:45:19,727 --> 00:45:22,321
...were all invented,
more or less, together...

692
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:27,467
...permitting many copies of a work
to be made and distributed.

693
00:45:27,735 --> 00:45:30,932
This is Chinese magic...

694
00:45:31,138 --> 00:45:33,163
...from the 12th century.

695
00:45:34,675 --> 00:45:37,109
It took 1000 years for
the idea to catch on...

696
00:45:37,311 --> 00:45:40,439
...in relatively remote
and backward Europe.

697
00:45:40,648 --> 00:45:44,516
Just before the invention
of movable type...

698
00:45:44,785 --> 00:45:47,049
...around the year 1450...

699
00:45:47,254 --> 00:45:50,052
...there were only a few
tens of thousands of books in Europe.

700
00:45:50,257 --> 00:45:52,817
Every one of them handwritten.

701
00:45:53,027 --> 00:45:57,862
Fifty years later, there were
10 million printed books in Europe.

702
00:45:58,065 --> 00:46:02,331
Learning became available to
anyone who could read.

703
00:46:02,536 --> 00:46:05,767
Suddenly, books were being
printed all over the world.

704
00:46:05,973 --> 00:46:08,999
Magic was everywhere.

705
00:46:10,811 --> 00:46:12,574
It is 23 centuries...

706
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:15,180
...since the founding
of the Alexandrian library.

707
00:46:15,716 --> 00:46:19,550
Since then, 100 generations
have lived and died.

708
00:46:19,753 --> 00:46:22,586
If information were passed on
merely by word of mouth...

709
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:24,849
...how little we should know
of our own past...

710
00:46:25,059 --> 00:46:27,425
...how slow would be our progress.

711
00:46:27,628 --> 00:46:29,858
Everything would depend on
what we'd been told...

712
00:46:30,064 --> 00:46:31,656
...on how accurate the account.

713
00:46:31,866 --> 00:46:33,663
Ancient learning might be revered...

714
00:46:33,868 --> 00:46:36,962
...but in successive retellings,
it would become muddled...

715
00:46:37,171 --> 00:46:38,570
...and then lost.

716
00:46:38,772 --> 00:46:41,707
Books permit us to
voyage through time...

717
00:46:41,909 --> 00:46:44,901
...to tap the wisdom
of our ancestors.

718
00:46:46,614 --> 00:46:49,981
A library connects us with
the insights and knowledge...

719
00:46:50,184 --> 00:46:52,914
...of the greatest minds
and the best teachers...

720
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:56,146
...drawn from the whole planet
and from all our history...

721
00:46:56,357 --> 00:46:58,587
...to instruct us without tiring...

722
00:46:58,792 --> 00:47:01,625
...and to inspire us to make
our own contributions...

723
00:47:01,829 --> 00:47:05,492
...to the collective knowledge
of the human species.

724
00:47:13,574 --> 00:47:17,374
There's a fair number
of Gutenberg Bibles...

725
00:47:17,578 --> 00:47:20,445
...and first folios of Shakespeare
in the world...

726
00:47:20,648 --> 00:47:22,980
...but most of the books
you see here...

727
00:47:23,184 --> 00:47:27,553
...are limited editions with
very few surviving copies.

728
00:47:27,755 --> 00:47:29,746
But there also exists in the world...

729
00:47:29,957 --> 00:47:33,324
...mass printings
of paperbound books...

730
00:47:33,527 --> 00:47:37,122
...that I think are still
more wonderful.

731
00:47:37,331 --> 00:47:39,731
For the price of a modest meal...

732
00:47:39,934 --> 00:47:42,664
...you get the history of Rome.

733
00:47:43,304 --> 00:47:47,240
Books are like seeds:
They can lie dormant for centuries...

734
00:47:47,441 --> 00:47:52,105
...but they may also produce flowers
in the most unpromising soil.

735
00:47:52,313 --> 00:47:57,250
These books are the repositories
of the knowledge of our species...

736
00:47:57,518 --> 00:48:00,681
...and of our long
evolutionary journey...

737
00:48:00,888 --> 00:48:04,551
...from genes to brains to books.

738
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:24,502
Libraries in ancient Egypt...

739
00:48:24,712 --> 00:48:26,680
...bore these words on their walls:

740
00:48:27,448 --> 00:48:30,781
"Nourishment for the soul."

741
00:48:31,151 --> 00:48:35,713
And that's still a pretty fair
assessment of what libraries provide.

742
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:55,903
Even at night, the city,
like the brain...

743
00:48:56,110 --> 00:48:58,874
...is busy assimilating
and distributing information.

744
00:48:59,079 --> 00:49:00,842
Information keeps it alive...

745
00:49:01,048 --> 00:49:05,246
...and provides the tools to
adapt to changing conditions.

746
00:49:07,321 --> 00:49:08,583
The long human journey...

747
00:49:08,789 --> 00:49:13,055
...from genes to brains
to books continues.

748
00:49:17,164 --> 00:49:18,961
Information itself evolves...

749
00:49:19,166 --> 00:49:23,466
...nurtured by open communication
and free inquiry.

750
00:49:26,674 --> 00:49:28,869
The units of biological
evolution are genes.

751
00:49:29,276 --> 00:49:31,972
The units of cultural
evolution are ideas.

752
00:49:32,179 --> 00:49:34,477
Ideas are transported
all over the planet.

753
00:49:34,748 --> 00:49:36,375
They reproduce through communication.

754
00:49:36,717 --> 00:49:39,948
They are selected by
analysis and debate.

755
00:49:40,154 --> 00:49:44,250
In the last few millennia, something
extraordinary has happened on Earth.

756
00:49:44,992 --> 00:49:48,325
Rich information from
distant lands and peoples...

757
00:49:48,529 --> 00:49:51,020
...has become routinely available.

758
00:49:52,466 --> 00:49:54,627
The number of bits to which
we have access...

759
00:49:54,835 --> 00:49:56,928
...has grown dramatically.

760
00:50:01,809 --> 00:50:04,243
Computers can now store and process...

761
00:50:04,445 --> 00:50:07,471
...enormous amounts of information
extremely rapidly.

762
00:50:07,681 --> 00:50:10,445
In our time, a revolution has begun.

763
00:50:10,651 --> 00:50:12,551
A revolution
perhaps as significant...

764
00:50:12,753 --> 00:50:15,415
...as the evolution
of DNA and nervous systems...

765
00:50:15,622 --> 00:50:17,112
...and the invention of writing.

766
00:50:18,258 --> 00:50:21,625
Direct communication among
billions of human beings...

767
00:50:21,829 --> 00:50:25,026
...is now made possible by
computers and satellites.

768
00:50:25,699 --> 00:50:28,634
The potential for a global
intelligence is emerging.

769
00:50:28,836 --> 00:50:33,034
Linking all the brains on Earth
into a planetary consciousness.

770
00:50:36,844 --> 00:50:38,903
Elsewhere, there may be brains...

771
00:50:39,113 --> 00:50:40,910
...even planetary brains...

772
00:50:41,115 --> 00:50:43,549
...but there will be no brains
quite like ours.

773
00:50:43,751 --> 00:50:47,585
Mutation and natural selection are
basically random processes.

774
00:50:47,788 --> 00:50:49,653
If the Earth were started
over again...

775
00:50:49,857 --> 00:50:51,791
...intelligence might
very well emerge...

776
00:50:51,992 --> 00:50:56,361
...but anything closely resembling
a human being would be unlikely.

777
00:50:57,731 --> 00:51:02,100
On another planet with a different
sequence of random processes...

778
00:51:02,302 --> 00:51:03,997
...to make heredity diversity...

779
00:51:04,204 --> 00:51:06,399
...and a different environment...

780
00:51:06,607 --> 00:51:08,939
...to select particular
combinations of genes...

781
00:51:09,143 --> 00:51:11,873
...the chance of finding beings
very similar to us...

782
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:13,546
...must be close to zero.

783
00:51:14,114 --> 00:51:16,173
But the chance of finding another
form of intelligence...

784
00:51:16,383 --> 00:51:17,475
...isn't close to zero.

785
00:51:17,684 --> 00:51:21,814
Their brains may well have evolved
from the inside out as ours have.

786
00:51:22,022 --> 00:51:25,822
They may well have switching elements
analogous to our neurons...

787
00:51:26,026 --> 00:51:28,221
...but their neurons might
be different.

788
00:51:28,429 --> 00:51:32,092
Maybe they're superconductors which
work at very low temperatures...

789
00:51:32,299 --> 00:51:35,097
...in which case,
their speed of thought...

790
00:51:35,302 --> 00:51:38,203
...might be 10 million times
faster than ours.

791
00:51:38,939 --> 00:51:41,840
Or perhaps their neurons are not in...

792
00:51:42,042 --> 00:51:44,909
...direct physical contact
with each other...

793
00:51:45,112 --> 00:51:47,444
...but in radio communication.

794
00:51:47,648 --> 00:51:49,411
So a single intelligent being...

795
00:51:49,616 --> 00:51:52,983
...could be distributed
among many different organisms.

796
00:51:53,187 --> 00:51:56,179
There may be planets in which
intelligent beings have...

797
00:51:56,390 --> 00:52:00,554
...not 10 to the 11th neurons each,
as we do...

798
00:52:00,761 --> 00:52:04,026
...but 10 to the 20th
or 10 to the 30th.

799
00:52:04,731 --> 00:52:08,064
I wonder what they would know.

800
00:52:08,268 --> 00:52:09,895
If we could make contact...

801
00:52:10,103 --> 00:52:11,195
...there would be...

802
00:52:11,405 --> 00:52:15,603
...much in their brains that would be
of enormous interest to ours.

803
00:52:16,343 --> 00:52:17,833
And vice versa.

804
00:52:18,045 --> 00:52:19,945
I think extraterrestrial
intelligence...

805
00:52:20,147 --> 00:52:22,945
...even beings astonishingly
more evolved than we...

806
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:26,642
...will be curious about us,
about what we know, how we think...

807
00:52:26,854 --> 00:52:30,950
...the course of our evolution,
the prospects for our future.

808
00:52:32,025 --> 00:52:35,324
Within every human brain,
patterns of electrochemical impulses...

809
00:52:35,529 --> 00:52:38,293
...are continuously forming
and dissipating.

810
00:52:38,499 --> 00:52:41,696
They reflect our emotions,
ideas and memories.

811
00:52:41,902 --> 00:52:44,063
When recorded and amplified...

812
00:52:44,271 --> 00:52:47,035
...these impulses sound like this.

813
00:52:47,241 --> 00:52:49,766
(RUMBLING)

814
00:52:49,977 --> 00:52:52,775
But would an extraterrestrial being,
no matter how advanced...

815
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:56,006
...be able to read the mind
that made these sounds?

816
00:52:56,216 --> 00:52:59,242
We ourselves are far
from being able to do so.

817
00:52:59,987 --> 00:53:03,445
But in fact, we have sent
the very impulses you are hearing...

818
00:53:03,657 --> 00:53:07,650
...reflecting the emotions, ideas
and memories of one human being...

819
00:53:07,861 --> 00:53:11,524
...on a voyage to the stars.

820
00:53:18,805 --> 00:53:21,933
In August and September 1977...

821
00:53:22,142 --> 00:53:24,975
...two Voyager spacecraft
were launched...

822
00:53:25,178 --> 00:53:29,638
...on an epic journey to
the outer solar system and beyond.

823
00:53:30,183 --> 00:53:34,210
Their scientific mission was
to explore the giant planets...

824
00:53:34,555 --> 00:53:36,386
...first Jupiter
and its satellites...

825
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:39,684
...and then Saturn
and its system of moons.

826
00:53:47,734 --> 00:53:50,294
Close encounters with
these great worlds...

827
00:53:50,504 --> 00:53:54,531
...accelerate the Voyager spacecraft
out of the solar system.

828
00:53:56,810 --> 00:53:59,574
As an incidental consequence
of their trajectories...

829
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:03,272
...they will be carried inexorably
into the realm of the stars...

830
00:54:03,483 --> 00:54:05,713
...where they will wander forever.

831
00:54:07,621 --> 00:54:10,613
The ships will be slightly eroded
within the solar system...

832
00:54:10,824 --> 00:54:13,657
...by micrometeorites,
planetary rings systems...

833
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:15,919
...and radiation belts.

834
00:54:19,866 --> 00:54:21,333
But once past the planets...

835
00:54:21,535 --> 00:54:24,163
...they will endure
for a billion years...

836
00:54:24,371 --> 00:54:27,772
...in the cold vacuum
of interstellar space.

837
00:54:28,809 --> 00:54:30,504
Perhaps in the distant future...

838
00:54:30,711 --> 00:54:34,340
...beings of an alien civilization
will intercept these ships.

839
00:54:34,548 --> 00:54:36,140
They'll examine our spacecraft...

840
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:39,717
...and understand much about
our science and technology.

841
00:54:40,854 --> 00:54:44,881
But a machine alone can tell
only so much about its makers.

842
00:54:45,092 --> 00:54:47,890
So each bears a golden
phonograph record...

843
00:54:48,095 --> 00:54:51,030
...with not only the brain waves
of a woman from Earth...

844
00:54:51,231 --> 00:54:55,827
...but also an anthology of music,
pictures and sounds of our planet...

845
00:54:56,036 --> 00:54:59,233
...including greetings
in 60 human languages...

846
00:54:59,439 --> 00:55:02,704
...and the salutations
of the humpback whales.

847
00:55:02,909 --> 00:55:06,174
The record cover bears instructions
on how to hear the sounds...

848
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:08,575
...and see the pictures
encoded on the disk.

849
00:55:08,782 --> 00:55:12,718
Including some snapshots
from the family album...

850
00:55:12,919 --> 00:55:15,012
...of a distant world.

851
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:46,683
The Voyager record is
a message in a bottle...

852
00:55:46,887 --> 00:55:49,515
...cast into the cosmic ocean.

853
00:55:49,723 --> 00:55:52,692
It contains some of our thoughts
and our feelings...

854
00:55:52,893 --> 00:55:55,020
...something of the information
we store...

855
00:55:55,228 --> 00:55:58,664
...in genes and brains and books.

856
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:02,159
The recipients, if any...

857
00:56:02,369 --> 00:56:06,305
...will understand the pictures
and sounds incompletely at best.

858
00:56:06,506 --> 00:56:08,770
But one thing would
be clear about us:

859
00:56:08,975 --> 00:56:11,773
No one sends such a message
on such a journey...

860
00:56:11,978 --> 00:56:15,141
...without a positive passion
for the future.

861
00:56:15,348 --> 00:56:17,816
For all the possible vagaries
of the message...

862
00:56:18,018 --> 00:56:21,181
...they will be sure that
we were a species endowed...

863
00:56:21,388 --> 00:56:25,757
...with hope and perseverance,
at least a little intelligence...

864
00:56:25,959 --> 00:56:30,225
...and a longing to make
contact with the cosmos.
