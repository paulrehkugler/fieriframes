A water bird?

789
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:53,067
I saw The Birds last week.
Think that planted the idea?

790
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:55,194
What else is a water bird?

791
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:59,198
Pelican, flamingo.

792
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:01,534
What about ducks?

793
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:10,000
Those goddamn ducks.

794
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:13,212
What is it about those ducks
that meant so much to you?

795
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:22,096
I don't know, it was a trip...

796
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:26,684
...having those wild creatures...

797
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:30,896
...come into my pool
and have their little babies.

798
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:39,822
I was sad to see them go.

799
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:44,910
Oh, Jesus, fuck. Now he's gonna cry.

800
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,421
Shit. Fuck me.

801
00:52:55,630 --> 00:53:00,759
When the ducks gave birth to those
babies, they became a family.

802
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:06,640
You're right.

803
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,935
It's a link. A connection.

804
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:13,731
I'm afraid I'm gonna
lose my family...

805
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,900
...like I lost the ducks.

806
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:20,905
That's what I'm full of dread about.

807
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:24,575
It's always with me.

808
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:27,119
What are you so afraid's
going to happen?

809
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:29,872
I don't know.

810
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:37,379
You work so hard.

811
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:41,967
You work so damn hard
and to see your life's dream...

812
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:45,095
...burn down.

813
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:48,265
Look at it this way,
you collect the insurance.

814
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:51,602
You gotta say to yourself,
"It could have been worse."

815
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:55,522
How could it have been worse?
Fucking faulty stove!

816
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:58,817
Suppose people stopped coming,
ever think of that?

817
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:03,155
I don't know.
I don't know what the fuck.

818
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:07,826
He's right.
There's no insurance for that.

819
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:12,706
Why would people stop coming to the
restaurant? It's just catching on.

820
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:16,168
You know what I'm
figuring out lately?

821
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:19,296
Talking helps.

822
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:21,632
- That's right.
- He's right. He's right.

823
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:28,347
Hope... comes in many forms.

824
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,182
Absolutely.

825
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:31,850
TONY:
Come on.

826
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:35,062
Here, hold this.

827
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:36,563
Artie.

828
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:38,857
Artie, come on.

829
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,192
Hey, hey.

830
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:42,861
Hey, look at me. Look at me.

831
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,531
I'll always help you.

832
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:48,200
Come on. Come on.

833
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,333
Go cook. Hey, let him cook.
He'll feel better.

834
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:12,224
Someday I'll tell him
we torched the restaurant.

835
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:20,399
All right, enough of this shit.
What's wrong?

836
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,402
You know, a simple...

837
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:27,489
..."Way to go, Chris, on the Triborough
Towers contract!" would have been nice.

838
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:29,074
That's it.

839
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:39,626
You're right.

840
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,503
You're right.

841
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:44,131
I have no defense.

842
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:49,136
That's how I was parented.
Never supported. Never complimented.

843
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:51,555
My cousin Gregory's girlfriend...

844
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:54,933
...is what they call a development
girl, out in Hollywood.

845
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:57,895
She said I could sell my life story,
make fucking millions.

846
00:55:58,104 --> 00:56:00,898
I didn't do that.
I stuck it out with you.

847
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:04,943
I'll fucking kill you.
Are you gonna go Henry Hill on me now?

848
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:08,280
You know how many mobsters are selling
screenplays and screwing things up?

849
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,657
She said I could maybe
even play myself.

850
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:12,451
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

851
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:20,626
Forget Hollywood screenplays.
Forget those distractions, huh?

852
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:24,171
What, you think I haven't had offers?

853
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:29,802
We got work to do. New avenues.

854
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:34,181
Everything's gonna be all right
from here on in. Come on.

855
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:38,811
Look, it's a beautiful day.
What could be bad?

856
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:44,650
It's nice of you to pick me up
for the party, Junior.

857
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:48,946
- At least somebody cares about me.
- These kids today.

858
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:52,658
I suppose he thinks once he's
got me in a nursing home...

859
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:57,663
...I'll die faster and then
he won't have to drive me anywhere.

860
00:56:58,289 --> 00:57:00,082
If his father was still alive...

861
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:05,087
...you can bet he'd show more
decency and respect for his mother.

862
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:08,382
Well, my brother John
was a man among men.

863
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:11,218
He was a saint.

864
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:15,180
Lots of things are different now
from Johnny's and my day.

865
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:16,515
What do you mean?

866
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:19,226
I'm not free to run my business
like I want.

867
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:20,853
Aw, isn't that awful.

868
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:22,896
Just this week, your son
stuck his hand in...

869
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:25,315
...and made it 100 times
more difficult for me.

870
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:27,609
Plus, he thumbs his nose at New York.

871
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:32,197
What are you gonna do?
He's part of a whole generation.

872
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:36,160
Do you remember the crazy hair?
And the dope?

873
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:37,703
Now it's fags in the military.

874
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:40,747
Stop it, Junior.
You're making me very upset!

875
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,251
I don't like to, Livia,
but I'm agita all the time.

876
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:48,213
And I'll tell you something else,
things are down all across the board.

877
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:50,757
A lot of friends of ours
are complaining.

878
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:54,511
We used to be recession-proof.
No more.

879
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:58,265
You can't blame it all
on the Justice Department.

880
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,643
Our friends say to me...

881
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:06,565
..."Junior, why don't you
take a larger hand in things?"

882
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:12,905
Something may have to be done, Livia,
about Tony.

883
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:15,157
I don't know.

884
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,541
There they are.
Hey, Ma, Uncle Jun.

885
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:29,588
LIVIA: You're using mesquite.
That makes the sausage taste peculiar.

886
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:33,300
- Hi, Grandma.
- Happy birthday, my big boy.

887
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:34,927
Carmela, my mother's here.

888
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,679
Everybody, let's eat.

889
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:57,991
[LAUGHING]
