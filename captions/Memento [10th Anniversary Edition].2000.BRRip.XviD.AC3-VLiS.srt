3
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,282
So where are you?

4
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,409
You're in some motel room.

5
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:41,662
You just wake up and you're in…

6
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:44,039
… in a motel room. There's the key.

7
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,793
It feels like maybe it's the first time
you've been here but…

8
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:50,462
… perhaps you've been there for a week,…

9
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,131
… three months, it's…

10
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:55,425
It's kind of hard to say, I… I don't know.

11
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:57,594
It's just an anonymous room.

12
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:02,474
This guy. He's here already.

13
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:05,561
Lenny!

14
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,021
It's Leonard.

15
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,860
- Like I told you before.
- Did you? I must have forgot.

16
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,697
I guess I've already told you
about my condition.

17
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:19,491
Oh, well, only every time I see you.

18
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,044
- My car.
- This is your car.

19
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,629
Oh, you're in a playful mood.

20
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:38,093
- It's not good to make fun of a handicap.
- Just trying to have a little fun.

21
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:44,266
<font color="#40a040">[starts engine]</font>

22
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:48,187
- Roll up your window.
- Hm?

23
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:55,402
- It's broken.
- I can get that fixed for you.

24
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:59,740
- So, where to, Sherlock?
- I got a lead on a place.

25
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:03,118
- What the hell you wanna go there for?
- You know it?

26
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,913
Yeah, it's just this fucked up building.
Why do you wanna go there?

27
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:09,291
Don't remember.

28
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,147
- Looks like somebody's home.
- Ah, that thing's been here for years.

29
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,862
What are you talking about?
These tracks are only a few days old.

30
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,657
Tracks? What are you, Pocahontas?

31
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,243
Come on.

32
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:54,253
Let's take a look inside.

33
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,981
Teddy.

34
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:18,235
Don't believe his lies.
He is the one. Kill him.

35
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,362
I've finally found him.

36
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,614
How long have I been looking?

37
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,826
Find anything?

38
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:28,328
Didn't think so.

39
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,746
Let's go, huh?

40
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:32,124
Oh, fuck this.

41
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:34,918
You're gonna pay for what you did.

42
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:38,755
Beg forgiveness and then you pay.

43
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,429
You don't have a clue, you freak!

44
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:49,308
Beg my wife's forgiveness
before I blow your brains out.

45
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:52,352
Leonard, you don't know what's going on.

46
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,897
- You don't even know my name.
- Teddy.

47
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,149
Cos you read it off a fucking picture.

48
00:05:57,274 --> 00:06:00,527
<font color="#40a040">[breathless]</font> You don't know who you are.

49
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:05,157
- I'm Leonard Shelby from San Francisco.
- That's who you were. That's not…

50
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:07,159
… what you've become.

51
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:10,537
- Shut your mouth.
- You want to know, Lenny? Come on.

52
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,956
Come on, let's go down to the basement.

53
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:16,001
Let's go down, you and me together.

54
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:19,254
Then you'll know who you really are.

55
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,551
- <font color="#40a040">[Teddy]</font> No!
- <font color="#40a040">[gunshot]</font>

56
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,222
It's just an anonymous room.

57
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:30,807
There's nothing in the drawers.
But you look anyway.

58
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:33,352
Nothing except the Gideon Bible,…

59
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:37,314
… which I, of course, read religiously.
<font color="#40a040">[laughs]</font> Hm.

60
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,360
You know who you are
and you know kind of all about yourself.

61
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:47,366
But just for day-to-day stuff,
notes are really useful.

62
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:52,454
Sammy Jankis had the same problem
but he really had no system.

63
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:56,875
He wrote himself a ridiculous amount
of notes but he'd get them all mixed up.

64
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,086
You really do need a system if…

65
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:01,213
… if you're gonna make it work.

66
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:54,308
<font color="#40a040">[presses bell]</font>

67
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,020
- Hi.
- Hi.

68
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:01,356
- I'm Mr Shelby from 304.
- What can I do for you, Leonard?

69
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,317
- Um…
- Burt.

70
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:06,737
Burt. I'm not sure, I think
I may have asked you to hold my calls.

71
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:09,656
- You don't know?
- I'm not too good on the phone.

72
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:12,534
You said you like to look people in the eye
when you talk to them.

73
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:13,911
Yeah, yeah.

74
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:17,831
- You don't remember saying that.
- I have this condition.

75
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:20,292
- A condition?
- It's my memory.

76
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:23,003
- Amnesia?
- No, no, it's different from that.

77
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:27,299
I have no short-term memory.
I know all about myself, I just…

78
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:31,220
Since my injury I can't make
new memories. Everything fades.

79
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:34,848
If we talk for too long
I'll forget how we started…

80
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:37,643
… and next time I see you
I won't remember this conversation.

81
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:40,187
I don't even know if I've met you before.

82
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,358
So if I seem a little strange
or rude, or something, uh…

83
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,861
I've told you this before, haven't I?

84
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:52,032
I don't mean to mess with you
but it's so weird.

85
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,326
- You don't remember me at all?
- No.

86
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:57,246
- We've talked a bunch of times.
- I'm sure we have.

87
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:00,374
What's the last thing you remember?

88
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,626
My wife.

89
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,003
What's it like?

90
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,134
It's like waking.

91
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,637
It's like you just woke up.

92
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,306
That must suck.

93
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,016
It's all backwards.

94
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:21,019
Like, maybe you got an idea
about what you want to do next…

95
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,313
… but you don't remember
what you just did.

96
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,983
I mean, I'm exactly the opposite…

97
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:29,152
- How long have I been staying here?
- Couple of days.

98
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:31,697
- And you're holding my calls?
- Like you said.

99
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:34,199
OK, but this guy's an exception.

100
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:35,659
You know this guy?

101
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,956
- Yeah, it's your friend, right?
- What makes you think that?

102
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,375
- I saw you together, that's all.
- He's not my friend.

103
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,877
OK.

104
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:48,672
If he calls or shows up here,
give me a call in my room, OK?

105
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,799
- What, his name's Teddy?
- Teddy, yeah.

106
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,718
All right.

107
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:56,013
Look, I hope my condition's
not gonna be a problem for you.

108
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:58,473
Not as long as you remember
to pay the bill.

109
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:01,143
Yeah. OK.

110
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:02,561
Forty.

111
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:05,814
This guy.

112
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:08,901
He's here already.

113
00:10:10,903 --> 00:10:12,696
Lenny!

114
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:17,993
You really need a system
if you're gonna make it work.

115
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:22,623
You kinda learn to trust your handwriting.
It becomes an important part of your life.

116
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:26,668
You write yourself notes.
Where you put them is really important.

117
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,463
You need a jacket that's got,
like, six pockets,…

118
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,632
… particular pockets
for particular things.

119
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:36,094
You just kinda learn to know where
things go and how the system works.

120
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,555
You have to be wary of other people
writing stuff foryou…

121
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,725
… that is not going to make sense
or is gonna lead you astray.

122
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:44,019
I don't know what makes people
take advantage…

123
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,146
… of somebody with this condition.

124
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:50,150
If you have a piece of information
which… is…

125
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:54,863
… vital, writing on your body instead of
on a piece ofpaper can be the answer.

126
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,990
It's a permanent way of keeping a note.

- … go east through town…
- I'm gonna write this down.

00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:58,927
- Oh, it's easy. Go straight out…
- Trust me, I need to write this down.

00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,862
It's him.

158
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,995
I've found you, you fuck.

159
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:15,767
You said we talked before.
I don't remember that.

160
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:17,895
Yeah, but it's not amnesia.

161
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,397
I remember up until my injury,
I just can't make new memories.

162
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:22,733
So I can't remember talking to you.
What did we talk about?

163
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:24,860
Oh, Sammy Jankis.

164
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:27,654
I guess I tell people about Sammy
to help them understand.

165
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:30,949
Sammy's story helps me understand
my own situation.

166
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:33,744
Sammy wrote himself
endless amounts of notes.

167
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,662
But he got mixed up.

168
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:40,167
I have a more graceful solution
to the memory problem.

169
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,837
I'm disciplined and organised.

170
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:46,715
I use habit and routine
to make my life possible.

171
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:49,176
Sammy had no drive,…

172
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:51,303
… no reason to make it work.

173
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:52,846
Me?

174
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:55,349
Yeah,…

175
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:57,476
… I got a reason.

176
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:11,240
<font color="#40a040">[activates alarm]</font>

177
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:17,829
Today, 1pm, meet Natalie for info.

178
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,210
She has also lost someone.
She will help you out ofpity.

179
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:42,771
- Natalie.
- You don't remember me.

180
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,566
- I should've explained. I have this cond…
- You did explain, Lenny.

181
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:49,278
Please call me Leonard.
My wife called me Lenny.

182
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:52,948
- I know, you told me.
- Then I probably told you I hated it.

183
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:54,950
Yeah.

184
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:57,953
Do you mind taking your glasses off?
It's hard for me to…

185
00:17:59,538 --> 00:18:00,330
Thanks.

186
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:03,000
So, you have information for me?

187
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,836
- Is that what your little note says?
- Yeah.

188
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:09,381
Must be tough living your life
according to a couple of scraps of paper.

189
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:12,926
Mix your laundry list with your grocery list
and you'll end up eating your underwear.

190
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:16,763
I guess that's why you have
those freaky tattoos.

191
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:19,474
Yeah, it's tough. It's almost impossible.

192
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:24,062
Look, I'm sorry I don't remember you.
It's nothing personal.

193
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:29,735
I do have information for you.

194
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:32,362
You gave me a license-plate number.

195
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:35,908
Had my friend at DMV trace it.

196
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:37,826
Guess what name came up?

197
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:42,414
John Edward Gammell. John G.

198
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:43,790
Do you know him?

199
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:47,628
No. But his face on his driver's licence
looked really familiar.

200
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:50,380
I think he's been in the bar, maybe.

201
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:53,926
Here's a copy of his licence,
his registration, photo and all.

202
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:56,053
Are you sure you want this?

203
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:58,847
- Have I told you what this man did?
- Yeah.

204
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:01,266
Well, then you shouldn't have to ask.

205
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:03,602
Even if you get revenge,
you're not gonna remember it.

206
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:05,729
You're not even gonna know it happened.

207
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:09,149
My wife deserves vengeance. It doesn't
make any difference if I know about it.

208
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:11,568
Just because
there are things I don't remember…

209
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:13,987
… doesn't make my actions meaningless.

210
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:17,574
The world doesn't just disappear
when you close your eyes.

211
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:21,370
Anyway, maybe I'll take a photograph
to remind myself.

212
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:23,497
Get another freaky tattoo.

213
00:19:27,793 --> 00:19:30,003
Tell me about her again.

214
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:32,464
Why?

215
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:35,300
Because you like to remember her.

216
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:39,221
She was beautiful.

217
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:43,016
- To me she was perfect.
- No.

218
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:45,978
Don't just recite the words.

219
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:50,482
Close your eyes and remember her.

220
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:03,161
You can just feel the details.

221
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:09,209
The bits and pieces
you never bothered to put into words.

222
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:16,842
And you can feel these extreme moments.

223
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:18,719
Even if you don't want to.

224
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:24,391
You put these together
and you get the feel of a person.

225
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:28,854
Enough to know
how much you miss them.

226
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:39,156
And how much you hate the person
who took them away.

227
00:20:48,207 --> 00:20:51,418
I, um, I added an address in here.

228
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:54,963
It might be useful.
It's an abandoned place outside of town.

229
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:57,966
Um, I guy I knew
used to do bigger deals there.

230
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:02,095
It's isolated.

231
00:21:02,221 --> 00:21:04,223
Sounds perfect.

232
00:21:06,892 --> 00:21:10,062
- Do I owe you any…
- I wasn't helping you for money.

233
00:21:10,187 --> 00:21:12,356
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

234
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:14,525
See, you have this condition.

235
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:20,531
You still staying at the Discount Inn?
Room 304? Left it at my place.

236
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:27,538
Yeah.

237
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:32,209
- They treating you OK?
- I don't remember.

238
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:37,130
You know what we have in common?

239
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:41,510
We are both survivors.

240
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:46,974
You take care, Leonard.

241
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:16,837
Remember Sammy Jankis.

242
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,009
I met Sammy through work. Insurance.
I was an investigator.

243
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:24,595
I'd investigate the claims
to see which ones were phoney.

244
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,722
I had to see through people's bullshit.

245
00:22:26,847 --> 00:22:29,516
It was useful experience
cos now it's my life.

246
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,895
When I meet someone,
I don't know if I've met them before.

247
00:22:32,978 --> 00:22:35,439
I have to look in their eyes
and try and figure them out.

248
00:22:35,564 --> 00:22:38,817
My job taught me the best way to find out
what someone knew was let them talk.

249
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:40,777
Watch the eyes and the body language.

250
00:22:40,903 --> 00:22:44,948
If someone scratches their nose,
experts tell you it means they're lying.

251
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:48,535
It really means they're nervous. People
get nervous for all sorts of reasons.

252
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,828
It's all about context.

253
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:51,955
Yeah, I was good.

254
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,083
Sammy was my first real challenge.

255
00:22:56,627 --> 00:22:58,420
<font color="#40a040">[engine starts]</font>

256
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:04,801
Yo, Lenny! I thought you'd split for good.

257
00:23:04,927 --> 00:23:07,304
- Well, things change.
- So I see.

258
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:10,474
- My name's Teddy.
- I guess I've told you about my condition.

259
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:14,561
Only every time I see ya.
Come on, I'll buy you lunch.

260
00:23:20,234 --> 00:23:22,444
- Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
- Mmm. Yeah.

261
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:24,571
I'm sick of hearing about the guy.

262
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:26,865
What about John G?
You think he's still here?

263
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,535
- Who?
- Johnny G, the guy you're looking for.

264
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,079
- That's why you haven't left town, right?
- Maybe.

265
00:23:32,204 --> 00:23:35,457
- Leonard, you have to be very careful.
- Why?

266
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:38,627
You mentioned that maybe somebody
was trying to set you up.

267
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,295
Get you to kill the wrong guy.

268
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,966
I go on facts, not recommendations,
but thank you.

269
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:47,094
Lenny, you can't trust a man's life
to your little notes and pictures.

270
00:23:47,219 --> 00:23:49,972
- Why not?
- Because your notes could be unreliable.

271
00:23:50,097 --> 00:23:51,765
- Memory's unreliable.
- Oh, please.

272
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:55,519
No, really. Memory's not perfect,
it's not even that good. Ask the police.

273
00:23:55,644 --> 00:23:58,021
Eyewitness testimony is unreliable.

274
00:23:58,146 --> 00:24:00,607
The cops don't catch a killer
by sitting around remembering stuff.

275
00:24:00,732 --> 00:24:03,694
- They collect facts and draw conclusions.
- That's not what I'm saying.

276
00:24:03,819 --> 00:24:05,946
Facts, not memories.

277
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:08,365
That's how you investigate.
I know, it's what I used to do.

278
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:12,411
Memory can change the shape of a room,
it can change the colour of a car.

279
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:14,913
And memories can be distorted.

280
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:17,040
They're an interpretation, not a record.

281
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:19,209
They're irrelevant if you have the facts.

282
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:22,296
You really want to get this guy, don't you?

283
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:25,924
He killed my wife.
He took away my fucking memory.

284
00:24:27,885 --> 00:24:30,429
He destroyed my ability to live.

285
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:34,725
You're living.

286
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:37,561
Only for revenge.

287
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:39,938
Well, then we'll get the bastard.

288
00:24:40,063 --> 00:24:42,191
Where are you staying?

289
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:49,198
The Discount Inn. I don't know what room.
I haven't got my key.

290
00:24:49,323 --> 00:24:51,491
Probably left it in your room.

291
00:25:03,128 --> 00:25:04,087
<font color="#40a040">[rings bell]</font>

292
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:06,715
Hi.

293
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,051
I'm checked in here
but I think I've misplaced my key.

294
00:25:09,176 --> 00:25:13,388
How you doing, Leonard?
Probably in the room, right?

295
00:25:32,115 --> 00:25:34,618
- I don't see my key anywhere.
- Oh, shit. This is the wrong room.

296
00:25:34,743 --> 00:25:36,578
You're in 304. I'm sorry. I fucked up.

297
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:39,456
- This is not my room?
- No. Come on, let's go.

298
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:41,416
Then why is this my handwriting?

299
00:25:45,295 --> 00:25:49,550
Well,… this was your room
but now you're in 304.

300
00:25:49,675 --> 00:25:51,885
- When was I in here?
- Last week.

301
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:55,389
- Then I rented you another room on top.
- Why?

302
00:25:55,514 --> 00:26:00,102
Business is slow, I mean, I told my boss
about your condition and stuff,…

303
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:01,895
… he said rent him another room.

304
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,231
So how many rooms am I checked into
in this shit hole?

305
00:26:04,356 --> 00:26:06,775
Just two. So far.

306
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,609
Well,…

307
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:10,320
… at least you're being honest
about ripping me off.

308
00:26:10,445 --> 00:26:14,992
- You're not going to remember anyway.
- You don't have to be that honest, Burt.

309
00:26:15,117 --> 00:26:17,828
Leonard. Always get a receipt.

310
00:26:18,662 --> 00:26:20,956
Oh, yeah. I'll write that down.

311
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:26,378
- Hey, what time is it?
- Quarter to one.

312
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:28,547
Excuse me.

313
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:30,257
Your room's…

314
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:45,105
- Natalie.
- You don't remember me.

315
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,358
I'd just become an investigator
when I came across Sammy.

316
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:52,154
Mr Samuel R Jankis, strangest case ever.

317
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:55,407
The guy's a 58-year-old,
semiretired accountant.

318
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:57,784
He and his wife were in this car accident,
nothing serious.

319
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:01,038
But he's acting funny,
he can't get a handle on what's going on.

320
00:27:02,581 --> 00:27:06,210
The doctors find some possible damage
to the hippocampus, nothing conclusive.

321
00:27:06,335 --> 00:27:09,963
Sammy can't remember anything
for more than a couple of minutes.

322
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:11,465
Can't work, can't do shit.

323
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:14,801
The medical bills pile up, his wife calls
the insurance company and I get sent in.

324
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:21,141
This is my first big claims investigation
so I really check into it.

325
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:24,937
Sammy can think just fine
but he can't make new memories.

326
00:27:25,062 --> 00:27:27,564
He can only remember things
for a couple of minutes.

327
00:27:29,274 --> 00:27:32,486
He'd watch TV but anything longer than
a couple of minutes was too confusing,…

328
00:27:32,611 --> 00:27:34,655
… he couldn't remember how it began.

329
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,074
He liked commercials. They were short.

330
00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:39,076
Sammy. It's time for my shot.

331
00:27:39,201 --> 00:27:42,204
The crazy part was that this guy,…

332
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:44,831
… who couldn't follow
the plot of Green Acres any more,…

333
00:27:44,957 --> 00:27:47,000
… could do the most complicated things,…

334
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:49,336
… as long as he learned them
before the accident…

335
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:54,049
… and as long as he kept his mind
on what he was doing.

336
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:57,970
The doctors assure me…

337
00:27:58,095 --> 00:28:02,307
… there's a real condition, anterial-grade
memory loss, or short-term memory loss.

338
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,393
It's rare but legit.

339
00:28:05,853 --> 00:28:08,605
But every time I see him,…

340
00:28:08,856 --> 00:28:11,066
… I catch this look,…

341
00:28:11,525 --> 00:28:14,570
… this… slight look of recognition.

342
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:17,447
But he says he can't remember me at all.

343
00:28:18,115 --> 00:28:20,117
Sammy, it's OK. I got it.

344
00:28:20,534 --> 00:28:22,870
- Hi, Mr Shelby.
- Hi, Mrs Jankis.

345
00:28:22,995 --> 00:28:27,291
Now, I can read people
and I'm thinking ''bad actor''.

346
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:30,085
So now I'm suspicious
and I order more tests.

347
00:28:33,547 --> 00:28:35,549
Awake.

348
00:28:36,884 --> 00:28:39,553
Oh, where am I?

349
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:44,183
Somebody's bedroom.

350
00:28:46,018 --> 00:28:48,270
Oh, it must be her room.

351
00:28:49,313 --> 00:28:51,315
But who is she?

352
00:28:59,281 --> 00:29:01,158
It's only me.

353
00:29:03,327 --> 00:29:06,413
- Did you sleep OK?
- Yeah. You?

354
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,042
Oh, shit. Shit.

355
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:11,877
I gotta be someplace.

356
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:17,174
It's pretty weird.

357
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:22,012
It's useful. You never
write a phone number on your hand?

358
00:29:22,137 --> 00:29:26,391
I, um, I should be able
to talk to my friend today…

359
00:29:26,517 --> 00:29:29,561
- … about the license plate.
- Yeah, the license plate.

360
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:32,105
John G's license plate.

361
00:29:34,983 --> 00:29:36,985
You have it tattooed on your thigh.

362
00:29:55,337 --> 00:29:57,339
Natalie.

363
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:03,428
She has also lost someone.
She will help you out ofpity.

364
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:10,644
If it's registered in this state,…

365
00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:13,021
… it should only take a couple seconds
to pull up his licence and registration.

366
00:30:13,146 --> 00:30:15,566
I'll call you as soon as I talk to him.

367
00:30:15,691 --> 00:30:18,610
Could we arrange a meeting now?
I'm not too good on the phone.

368
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:30,205
You know, it's great that you…

369
00:30:30,455 --> 00:30:32,249
Well, that you're…

370
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:34,168
… helping me…

371
00:30:34,459 --> 00:30:35,836
… like this.

372
00:30:35,961 --> 00:30:39,256
I'm helping you because you helped me.

373
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:53,854
So next time you see me,…

374
00:30:53,979 --> 00:30:55,397
… will you remember me?

375
00:31:12,456 --> 00:31:14,666
<font color="#40a040">[softly]</font> I think you will.

376
00:31:15,876 --> 00:31:17,878
<font color="#40a040">[softly]</font> I'm sorry.

377
00:31:20,214 --> 00:31:23,800
Lenny, before you go,
could I have my shirt back, please?

378
00:31:35,437 --> 00:31:37,439
<font color="#40a040">[engine starts]</font>

379
00:31:40,192 --> 00:31:43,070
Yo, Lenny! I thought you'd split for good.

380
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:46,156
Sammy couldn't pick up
any new skills at all.

381
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:48,659
But I find something in my research.

382
00:31:48,784 --> 00:31:50,327
Conditioning.

383
00:31:50,452 --> 00:31:53,372
Sammy should still be able to learn
through repetition.

384
00:31:53,497 --> 00:31:56,792
It's how you learn stuff like riding a bike.
You get better through practice.

385
00:31:56,917 --> 00:31:59,127
It's a different part of the brain
from the short-term memory.

386
00:31:59,253 --> 00:32:02,798
So I had the doctors
test Sammy's response to conditioning.

387
00:32:02,923 --> 00:32:07,010
- Pick up any three objects.
- That's a test?

388
00:32:07,135 --> 00:32:09,471
Where were you guys when I did my CPA?

389
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:10,973
Sorry.

390
00:32:13,183 --> 00:32:14,601
Ta-da!

391
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,521
- <font color="#40a040">[buzz]</font>
- Ow! What the fuck?

392
00:32:17,646 --> 00:32:20,023
- It's a test, Sammy.
- Test this, you fucking quack.

393
00:32:22,693 --> 00:32:25,779
Some of the objects were electrified.
They'd give him a shock.

394
00:32:25,904 --> 00:32:28,991
They kept repeating the test,
always with the same objects electrified.

395
00:32:29,116 --> 00:32:32,536
The point was to see if Sammy could
learn to avoid the electrified objects,…

396
00:32:32,661 --> 00:32:34,872
… not by memory, but by instinct.

397
00:32:43,797 --> 00:32:45,799
<font color="#40a040">[activates alarm]</font>

398
00:32:50,262 --> 00:32:52,264
<font color="#40a040">[knocks on door]</font>

399
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:58,312
Natalie, right? Who the fuck is Dodd?

400
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:03,442
Guess I don't have to worry about him
any more.

401
00:33:03,567 --> 00:33:05,485
- What the fuck have you got me into?
- Shh. Come inside.

402
00:33:09,823 --> 00:33:12,743
- Who is he?
- Calm down. OK?

403
00:33:12,868 --> 00:33:16,330
This is my problem. You offered to help.
It's nothing to do with your investigation.

404
00:33:16,455 --> 00:33:17,915
How did you get me into this?

405
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,042
You offered to help me
when you saw what he did to my face.

406
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:23,670
- How do I know he did that to your face?
- I came straight to you after he did it.

407
00:33:23,795 --> 00:33:26,048
I showed you what he did
and I asked you to help me.

408
00:33:26,173 --> 00:33:29,009
- Oh, and I just take your word?
- Yeah.

409
00:33:29,468 --> 00:33:31,678
Something doesn't feel right.

410
00:33:31,803 --> 00:33:34,181
I think someone's fucking with me,
trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.

411
00:33:34,306 --> 00:33:35,599
- Did you?
- What?

412
00:33:35,724 --> 00:33:37,518
Kill him?

413
00:33:37,726 --> 00:33:41,104
- Course not!
- Hey. Sit down, OK? Sit.

414
00:33:41,855 --> 00:33:46,777
This has nothing to do with you.
You helped me out and I'm grateful.

415
00:33:47,486 --> 00:33:49,196
You have to burn them.

416
00:33:52,783 --> 00:33:56,745
Leonard, you decided to help me.
Trust your own judgement.

417
00:33:56,870 --> 00:34:00,290
You can question everything,
you can never know anything for sure.

418
00:34:00,415 --> 00:34:03,085
- There are things you know for sure.
- Such as?

419
00:34:04,086 --> 00:34:07,756
I know what that's gonna sound like
when I knock on it. <font color="#40a040">[knocks]</font>

420
00:34:07,881 --> 00:34:11,260
I know what that's gonna feel like
when I pick it up. See?

421
00:34:11,385 --> 00:34:14,137
Certainties. It's the kind of memory
you take for granted.

422
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:18,642
You know, I can remember so much.

423
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:21,812
The feel of the world…

424
00:34:22,354 --> 00:34:24,356
And her.

425
00:34:30,195 --> 00:34:32,197
She's gone.

426
00:34:32,322 --> 00:34:36,201
And the present is trivia
which I scribble down as fucking notes.

427
00:34:36,326 --> 00:34:38,996
Hey, come on. Try and relax. Come on.

428
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:42,124
- It's not easy for me to relax.
- Shh. Shhh.

429
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:44,626
Come on, take your jacket off.

430
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:47,004
<font color="#40a040">[softly]</font> Here. Come on.

431
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:50,299
<font color="#40a040">[softly]</font> Hey.

432
00:34:50,674 --> 00:34:52,676
Didn't think you were the type.

433
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,062
It's backwards.

434
00:35:05,105 --> 00:35:07,774
Come here. Come here.

435
00:35:29,379 --> 00:35:31,381
What about here?

436
00:35:32,966 --> 00:35:35,385
Maybe it's… for when I find him.

437
00:35:37,971 --> 00:35:40,724
I've lost somebody too.

438
00:35:42,017 --> 00:35:44,019
I'm sorry.

439
00:35:44,144 --> 00:35:46,021
His name was Jimmy.

440
00:35:46,104 --> 00:35:48,482
- What happened to him?
- He went to meet somebody.

441
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:51,527
He never came back.

442
00:35:52,611 --> 00:35:55,656
- Who did he go to meet?
- A guy called Teddy.

443
00:35:56,532 --> 00:35:58,575
What do the police think?

444
00:35:58,867 --> 00:36:02,579
They don't look too hard
for guys like Jimmy.

445
00:36:03,247 --> 00:36:05,916
When you find this guy, this…

446
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:09,253
… John G, what are you gonna do?

447
00:36:11,713 --> 00:36:13,715
I'm gonna kill him.

448
00:36:15,509 --> 00:36:18,303
Maybe I can help you find him.

449
00:36:22,474 --> 00:36:26,186
I don't even know how long
she's been gone.

450
00:36:29,314 --> 00:36:32,985
It's like I've woken up in bed
and she's not here…

451
00:36:34,736 --> 00:36:38,866
… because she's gone to the bathroom
or something.

452
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,580
But somehow I just…

453
00:36:45,372 --> 00:36:49,668
I just know
she's never gonna come back to bed.

454
00:36:53,672 --> 00:36:55,716
If I could just…

455
00:36:56,091 --> 00:36:59,845
… reach over
and touch her side of the bed,…

456
00:37:01,138 --> 00:37:03,932
… I would know that it was cold.

457
00:37:06,226 --> 00:37:08,437
But I can't.

458
00:37:12,107 --> 00:37:14,151
I know I can't have her back.

459
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:20,866
But I don't want to wake up in the morning
thinking she's still here.

460
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:25,954
I lie here not knowing
how long I've been alone.

461
00:37:31,835 --> 00:37:33,837
So how…

462
00:37:34,505 --> 00:37:36,590
How can I heal?

463
00:37:39,092 --> 00:37:42,179
How am I supposed to heal if I can't…

464
00:37:43,055 --> 00:37:45,140
… feel time?

465
00:38:57,254 --> 00:39:01,967
She has also lost someone.
She will help you out ofpity.

466
00:39:27,075 --> 00:39:29,870
They kept testing Sammy for months.

467
00:39:29,995 --> 00:39:32,915
Always with the same objects
carrying the electrical charge.

468
00:39:33,081 --> 00:39:35,083
- <font color="#40a040">[buzz]</font>
- Ow! What the fuck?

469
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:37,586
- It's a test, Sammy.
- Test this, you fucking quack!

470
00:39:37,711 --> 00:39:39,755
Even with total short-term memory loss,…

471
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:43,217
… Sammy should have learned instinctively
to stop picking up the wrong objects.

472
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:47,346
Other cases responded to conditioning,
Sammy didn't respond at all.

473
00:39:47,429 --> 00:39:51,016
It suggested that his condition
was psychological not physical.

474
00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:55,646
We turned down his claim on the grounds
that he wasn't covered for mental illness.

475
00:39:55,771 --> 00:39:59,233
His wife got stuck with the bills
and I got a big promotion.

476
00:39:59,942 --> 00:40:03,862
Conditioning didn't work for Sammy,
so he became helpless.

477
00:40:03,987 --> 00:40:05,989
But it works for me.

478
00:40:06,114 --> 00:40:08,158
I live the way Sammy couldn't.

479
00:40:08,283 --> 00:40:10,744
Habit and routine make my life possible.

480
00:40:10,869 --> 00:40:13,622
Conditioning. Acting on instinct.

481

Where am I?

485
00:40:28,512 --> 00:40:30,514
Motel room.

486
00:40:31,014 --> 00:40:33,016
Oh.

487
00:40:36,728 --> 00:40:39,523
Some anonymous motel room.

488
00:40:43,068 --> 00:40:46,530
Nothing in the drawers.
But I'll take a look anyway.

489
00:40:46,697 --> 00:40:48,699
Nothing except the Gideon Bi…

490
00:40:48,824 --> 00:40:50,659
Bible.

- Finished playing with yourself, Lenny?

501
00:41:45,297 --> 00:41:47,799
- Amorous neighbours.
- What are you doing here?

502
00:41:47,883 --> 00:41:51,595
<font color="#40a040">[laughs]</font> You called me.
You said you needed my help.

503
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,140
You know, I've had more
rewarding friendships than this one.

504
00:41:55,224 --> 00:41:58,644
Although I do get to keep telling
the same jokes.

505
00:41:58,769 --> 00:42:00,437
What the fuck is that?

506
00:42:06,944 --> 00:42:08,403
Who the fuck is that?

507
00:42:08,529 --> 00:42:10,531
- You don't know him?
- No! Should I?

508
00:42:10,781 --> 00:42:14,868
- Wait a minute. Is that John G?
- I don't think so.

509
00:42:14,993 --> 00:42:16,995
You don't think so?
You didn't write it down?

510
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:20,415
- I might have fallen asleep before I did.
- For Christ sakes!

511
00:42:21,542 --> 00:42:23,544
Ask him.

512
00:42:27,214 --> 00:42:29,883
What's your name? Your name?

513
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,302
- Dodd.
- And who did this to you?

514
00:42:32,427 --> 00:42:34,429
- What?
- Who did this to you?

515
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:37,140
You did.

516
00:42:39,184 --> 00:42:43,063
- I'm not going to help you kill that guy.
- No, no. Just let me think for a minute.

517
00:42:46,483 --> 00:42:48,485
<font color="#40a040">[muffled cries]</font>

518
00:42:48,861 --> 00:42:51,822
OK, Natalie. Who's Natalie? Natalie who?

519
00:42:51,947 --> 00:42:54,157
- Why?
- Maybe I know her.

520
00:42:54,283 --> 00:42:56,827
Look, we gotta get him out of here.

521
00:42:56,952 --> 00:42:58,954
All right, all right, all right.

522
00:42:59,872 --> 00:43:01,957
He's got to have a car, right?

523
00:43:02,082 --> 00:43:05,335
We take him to his car, tell him to get the
fuck out of town or we're gonna kill him.

524
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,462
We can't walk him out of here
tied up and bleeding.

525
00:43:07,588 --> 00:43:09,965
- How the fuck did you get him up here?
- I don't know!

526
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:12,509
- You don't know.
- <font color="#40a040">[muffled banging]</font>

527
00:43:13,844 --> 00:43:17,764
Yes, I do. This is not my room.
It must be his room. Great. Let's go.

528
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:19,892
- No, no, no. We can't just leave him here.
- Why not?

529
00:43:20,017 --> 00:43:25,147
Because the maid's gonna walk in.
She'll see him, call the cops. He can ID us.

530
00:43:26,356 --> 00:43:29,193
OK. We untie him, we clean him up…

531
00:43:29,318 --> 00:43:31,361
… and we march him out of here
with a gun in his back.

532
00:43:31,486 --> 00:43:33,530
A gun. Why would I have a gun?

533
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:38,911
It must be his. I don't think
they'd let someone like me carry a gun.

534
00:43:39,244 --> 00:43:41,038
Fucking hope not.

535
00:43:48,462 --> 00:43:50,464
Which one?

536
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:55,677
We should probably steal his car.
You know, teach him a lesson.

537
00:43:55,802 --> 00:43:58,722
- Shut up.
- It's all right for you, you've got the Jag.

538
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:01,892
All right, get in.
I'm gonna ride with him, you follow us.

539
00:44:02,017 --> 00:44:04,019
Give me your keys.

540
00:44:04,144 --> 00:44:06,146
Take your own car.

541
00:44:33,257 --> 00:44:35,259
So was he scared?

542
00:44:35,384 --> 00:44:37,261
I think it was your sinister moustache.

543
00:44:37,344 --> 00:44:40,180
Fuck you. Should have stolen his car.

544
00:44:40,305 --> 00:44:44,226
- Why? What's wrong with this one?
- Nothing. You want to trade?

545
00:44:46,562 --> 00:44:48,605
So what do you do now?

546
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:51,900
I'm gonna find out
what the fuck that was all about.

<font color="#40a040">[knocks]</font>

548
00:44:58,615 --> 00:45:01,159
Natalie, right? Who the fuck is Dodd?

549
00:45:03,328 --> 00:45:06,832
Sammy's wife was crippled
by the cost of supporting him.

550
00:45:06,957 --> 00:45:10,002
And fighting the company's decision.

551
00:45:10,544 --> 00:45:13,213
But it wasn't the money that got to her.

552
00:45:13,297 --> 00:45:15,716
I never said that Sammy was faking.

553
00:45:15,841 --> 00:45:17,843
Sammy, I have an idea.

554
00:45:17,968 --> 00:45:21,263
Just that his problem was mental,
not physical.

555
00:45:21,388 --> 00:45:24,057
You're gonna have a pen in your pocket.

556
00:45:24,183 --> 00:45:25,976
She couldn't understand.

557
00:45:26,101 --> 00:45:28,687
- I did something wrong?
- You did something wrong!

558
00:45:28,812 --> 00:45:32,107
We're gonna deal with it.
We're gonna try a little harder.

559
00:45:32,232 --> 00:45:35,194
She looks into his eyes
and sees the same person…

560
00:45:35,319 --> 00:45:37,905
… and if it's not a physical problem,
he should snap out of it.

561
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:38,989
- Ellen called!
- Ellen called.

562
00:45:39,114 --> 00:45:42,034
Ellen called.
Ellen… Ellen can't come today!

563
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:44,703
- Ellen can't come!
- I'm so sorry! I'm sorry!

company gives her the seed of doubt.

Just like he gave it to the doctors.

567
00:45:57,799 --> 00:46:00,177
But I never said that he was faking.

568
00:46:00,302 --> 00:46:02,304

can't bully someone into remembering.

00:53:14,403 --> 00:53:16,363
- Where'd you get it?
- Are you interested in buying one?

613
00:53:16,488 --> 00:53:18,907
What, I haven't made
a strong enough impression on you?

614
00:53:19,032 --> 00:53:21,702
- I wouldn't be too hard on yourself.

616
00:53:31,753 --> 00:53:34,006
OK. So what am I doing?

621
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,558
Ouch! Cut it out.

622
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:41,508
- How can you read that again?
- It's good.

623
00:55:41,633 --> 00:55:46,305
- You've read it, like, a thousand times.
- I enjoy it.

624
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:50,309
I thought the pleasure of a book was
in wanting to know what happens next.

625
00:55:50,434 --> 00:55:53,937
Don't be a prick.
I'm not reading it to annoy you. I enjoy it.

626
00:55:55,939 --> 00:55:58,525
Just let me read. Please?

627
00:56:09,328 --> 00:56:11,622
Probably tried this before.

628
00:56:13,874 --> 00:56:17,044
Probably burned truckloads of your stuff.

629
00:56:19,087 --> 00:56:21,757
Can't remember to forget you.

630
00:56:39,149 --> 00:56:40,526
Yeah.

631
00:56:40,651 --> 00:56:42,736
Uh-huh.

632
00:56:42,861 --> 00:56:48,033
Well, sir, that'd certainly be in keeping
with some of my own discoveries.

633
00:56:48,158 --> 00:56:51,245
I was hoping for more on the drugs angle.
Will you hang on a sec?

634
00:57:00,379 --> 00:57:03,090
The police report mentioned the drugs
found in the car outside my house.

635
00:57:03,215 --> 00:57:05,259
The car was stolen.
His prints were all over it.

636
00:57:05,384 --> 00:57:07,386
I got friends in the department.
They gave me a copy.

637
00:57:07,511 --> 00:57:09,429
I dealt with the police a lot
in my insurance job.

638
00:57:09,555 --> 00:57:15,102
With my condition it's really tough.
I can't keep it all in mind at once.

639
00:57:15,227 --> 00:57:16,895
I have to summarise the sections.

640
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:20,190
There are pages missing.
I guess I've been trying to log them all.

641
00:57:20,315 --> 00:57:22,526
I don't know why these are crossed out.

642
00:57:22,651 --> 00:57:24,695
They weren't even looking for John G.

643
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:27,573
The stuff they found in the car fit in with
what they believed had happened,…

644
00:57:27,698 --> 00:57:29,825
… so they didn't chase it up.

645
00:57:30,951 --> 00:57:32,953
<font color="#40a040">[door slams]</font>

646
00:58:05,152 --> 00:58:06,528
Honey?

647
00:58:09,072 --> 00:58:11,074
Honey, it's late.

648
00:58:33,013 --> 00:58:35,015
Everything OK?

649
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:36,767
<font color="#40a040">[muffled cry]</font>

00:58:51,406 --> 00:58:53,867

- You OK in there?

652
00:58:56,828 --> 00:58:59,331
<font color="#40a040">[sniffs]</font> Was it good for you?

<font color="#40a040">[laughs softly]</font>

654
00:59:01,583 --> 00:59:04,419
What? Was I supposed to lock the door?

655
00:59:05,629 --> 00:59:07,422
<font color="#40a040">[softly]</font> No.

656
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:10,801
I'd like you to leave now.

657
00:59:21,645 --> 00:59:23,647
<font color="#40a040">[clicks off alarm]</font>

658
00:59:31,321 --> 00:59:34,867
There's something about the drugs
stashed in the car that doesn't ring true.

659
00:59:34,992 --> 00:59:39,162
The police claim the guy was an addict
needing money to score. It's bullshit.

660
00:59:39,288 --> 00:59:43,584
He's not gonna go breaking into places
while he's still got a stash that big.

661
00:59:43,917 --> 00:59:46,461
Well, I think John G left it there.
Or planted it there.

662
00:59:48,338 --> 00:59:50,340
How do you know that?

663
00:59:52,342 --> 00:59:54,344
Oh, shit, that's true. It fits.

664
00:59:54,469 --> 00:59:56,471
So he's a dealer.

665
00:59:56,930 --> 00:59:59,057
Hang on a sec.

666
01:00:08,859 --> 01:00:10,986
Now we're getting somewhere.

667
01:00:11,778 --> 01:00:13,071
Discount Inn.

668

<font color="#40a040">[activates alarm]</font>

670
01:01:05,999 --> 01:01:07,584
Yeah, OK.

671
01:01:07,709 --> 01:01:09,711
Blonde's fine.

672
01:01:10,587 --> 01:01:12,589
Well, that's what they say.

673
01:01:13,465 --> 01:01:15,717
The Discount Inn. 304.

674
01:01:16,844 --> 01:01:18,637
Leonard.

675
01:01:19,263 --> 01:01:20,639
Well, what then?

676
01:01:20,764 --> 01:01:23,809
We just go to bed.
You wait for me to fall asleep.

677
01:01:23,934 --> 01:01:26,103
You go into the bathroom
and slam the door.

678
01:01:26,228 --> 01:01:28,730
- Slam it?
- Yeah. Loud enough to wake me up.

679
01:01:28,856 --> 01:01:30,732
- And that's it?
- That's it.

680
01:01:31,316 --> 01:01:32,276
Ah…

681
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:36,572
Yeah, first I just need you
to put these things around the room.

682
01:01:39,366 --> 01:01:41,785
Pretend they're your things
and this is your bedroom.

683
01:01:54,631 --> 01:01:59,428
- Should I wear it?
- No, no, no. Uh, just like you took it off.

684
01:02:03,098 --> 01:02:04,850
I don't want you to use it. I'm sorry.

685
01:02:06,602 --> 01:02:12,065
I just mean put them around the room,
as if they were your… your things.

686
01:02:15,777 --> 01:02:17,779
Whatever gets you off.

687
01:02:38,217 --> 01:02:40,219
<font color="#40a040">[door slams]</font>

688
01:02:41,803 --> 01:02:45,140
I can't blame the cops
for not taking me seriously.

689
01:02:45,265 --> 01:02:48,143
This is a difficult condition to understand.
Look at Sammy Jankis.

690
01:02:48,268 --> 01:02:50,312
His own wife couldn't deal with it.

691
01:02:50,437 --> 01:02:53,106
I told you how she tried to get him
to snap out of it.

692
01:02:53,232 --> 01:02:55,526
She came to see me at the office.
I found out all kinds of shit.

693
01:02:55,651 --> 01:02:59,112
She told me about life with Sammy.
How she treated him.

694
01:02:59,238 --> 01:03:00,656
Thank you for seeing me.

695
01:03:00,781 --> 01:03:03,450
She'd get Sammy to hide food
around the house,…

696
01:03:03,534 --> 01:03:06,286
… then she'd stop feeding him to see
if his hunger would make him remember.

697
01:03:06,411 --> 01:03:09,665
I've taken him to a parking lot and, uh…

698
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:13,335
She wasn't a cruel person.
She just wanted her old Sammy back.

699
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:16,213
You know all about Sammy
and you've decided he's faking.

700
01:03:16,338 --> 01:03:19,049
The company's position
isn't that Sammy's faking anything,…

701
01:03:19,174 --> 01:03:21,426
… just that his condition
can't be shown to be…

702
01:03:21,552 --> 01:03:23,470
I just want to know
your honest opinion about Sammy.

703
01:03:24,221 --> 01:03:27,474
We shouldn't be talking like this
while the case is still open to appeal.

704
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:30,853
- I'm not appealing the decision.
- Then why are you here?

705
01:03:30,978 --> 01:03:36,859
Try to understand, when I look at Sammy,
I don't see some… vegetable.

706
01:03:36,984 --> 01:03:39,486
I see my same old Sammy.

707
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:42,322
What do you think that's like for me,…

708
01:03:42,447 --> 01:03:45,576
… to suspect that he might be imagining
this whole problem?

709
01:03:45,701 --> 01:03:47,744
That if I just could say the right thing,…

710
01:03:47,870 --> 01:03:51,999
… he'd snap out of it
and go back to being normal.

711
01:03:52,416 --> 01:03:54,418
If I…

712
01:03:55,752 --> 01:03:59,047
If I knew that my old Sammy
were truly gone,…

713
01:03:59,173 --> 01:04:04,136
… then I could say goodbye
and start loving this new Sammy.

714
01:04:06,054 --> 01:04:09,099
As long as I have doubt
I can't say goodbye and move on.

715
01:04:09,224 --> 01:04:11,226
What do you want from me?

716
01:04:11,351 --> 01:04:14,396
I want you to forget the company
you work for for thirty seconds…

717
01:04:14,521 --> 01:04:17,900
… and tell me if you really believe
that Sammy's faking his condition.

718
01:04:19,276 --> 01:04:21,278
I need to know…

719
01:04:21,486 --> 01:04:23,906
… what you honestly believe.

720
01:04:28,243 --> 01:04:32,122
I believe that Sammy should be physically
capable of making new memories.

721
01:04:39,338 --> 01:04:41,131
Thank you.

722
01:04:42,716 --> 01:04:44,718
I thought I'd helped her.

723
01:04:44,843 --> 01:04:48,805
I thought she just needed an answer.
I didn't think it was important what it was.

724
01:04:49,473 --> 01:04:52,142
Just that she had one to believe.

725
01:05:06,782 --> 01:05:09,576
- A car this nice you should lock.
- Who the fuck are you?

726
01:05:09,701 --> 01:05:12,496
- Teddy, your buddy.
- Prove it!

727
01:05:12,621 --> 01:05:15,457
Remember Sammy?
You told me about Sammy!

728
01:05:17,292 --> 01:05:20,212
- Jeez!
- What the fuck are you doing in my car?

729
01:05:20,337 --> 01:05:24,883
What, your sense of humour went with the
memory? Do you know why you're here?

730
01:05:25,008 --> 01:05:27,010
- Unfinished business.
- Lenny,…

731
01:05:27,135 --> 01:05:30,931
… let me inform you,
your business here is very much finished.

732
01:05:31,056 --> 01:05:34,017
- You're still here because of Natalie.
- Who's Natalie?

733
01:05:34,142 --> 01:05:38,021
Schmuck! Whose house
do you think you just walked out of?

734
01:05:39,648 --> 01:05:43,819
That's right, take a look at your pictures.
I bet you got one of her.

735
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:47,239
Oh, nice shot, Leibovitz!

736
01:05:48,448 --> 01:05:51,118
You'll want to make a note.
You can't trust her.

737
01:05:51,201 --> 01:05:52,536
Why's that?

738
01:05:52,661 --> 01:05:55,956
Because by now
she's taken a look at the suit and the car…

739
01:05:56,081 --> 01:06:00,210
… and she's figuring out ways
of turning the situation to her advantage.

740
01:06:01,962 --> 01:06:05,424
She's already got you staying with her,
for Christ sakes. You can't go back there.

741
01:06:05,549 --> 01:06:07,426
Let me give you the name of a motel.

742
01:06:07,551 --> 01:06:10,137
You're lucky I ran into you.
That broad's bad news.

743
01:06:10,262 --> 01:06:13,765
- What do you mean, ''bad news''?
- She's involved with drugs.

744
01:06:13,891 --> 01:06:15,142
Look. See these?

745
01:06:15,267 --> 01:06:20,272
This is the bar where she works.
Her boyfriend's a drug dealer.

746
01:06:20,397 --> 01:06:23,108
She takes orders for him, arranges meets.

747
01:06:23,233 --> 01:06:25,903
He writes messages
on the back of these,…

748
01:06:25,986 --> 01:06:28,655
… then she slips him the answers
when she serves him his drinks.

749
01:06:28,739 --> 01:06:32,701
- Why should I care?
- Because when she gets jammed up,…

750
01:06:32,826 --> 01:06:34,828
… she's gonna use you to protect herself.

751
01:06:34,953 --> 01:06:36,413
From who?

752
01:06:36,538 --> 01:06:39,124
Guys are gonna wanna know
what happened to her boyfriend.

753
01:06:39,249 --> 01:06:41,502
Guys are gonna come after her.

754
01:06:41,627 --> 01:06:44,421
Somebody's got to pay, Lenny.
Somebody always pays.

755
01:06:44,546 --> 01:06:45,923
Maybe she'll make it you.

756
01:06:46,048 --> 01:06:49,510
Oh, yeah?
Well, maybe she'll make it you. Is that it?

757
01:06:49,635 --> 01:06:51,803
You worried
that she's gonna use me against you?

758
01:06:51,929 --> 01:06:53,931
- No.
- Why not?

759
01:06:54,056 --> 01:06:56,934
Because she doesn't know who I am.

760
01:06:57,559 --> 01:07:00,479
- Why are you following me?
- Maybe I wanna help.

761
01:07:00,604 --> 01:07:04,691
She doesn't know anything
about your investigation. OK, Einstein?

762
01:07:04,816 --> 01:07:06,944
So write this down.

763
01:07:07,486 --> 01:07:11,657
When she offers to help,
it'll be for her own reasons.

764
01:07:12,157 --> 01:07:16,870
I'm not lying.
Take my pen, write this down.

765
01:07:16,995 --> 01:07:19,164
Do not trust her.

766
01:07:26,338 --> 01:07:28,340
There. You happy now?

767
01:07:28,465 --> 01:07:31,301
- I won't be happy until you leave town.
- Why not?

768
01:07:31,426 --> 01:07:34,388
You ever wonder
how long you can hang around here…

769
01:07:34,513 --> 01:07:36,807
- … before people start asking questions?
- What sort of questions?

770
01:07:36,932 --> 01:07:39,017
The same questions
you should be asking yourself.

771
01:07:39,142 --> 01:07:41,812
- Like what?
- Like how did you get this suit, the car?

772
01:07:41,937 --> 01:07:43,355
- I have money.
- From what?

773
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:46,817
My wife's death. I used to work
in insurance. We were well covered.

774
01:07:46,942 --> 01:07:48,735
Oh!

775
01:07:49,111 --> 01:07:53,490
So in your grief
you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?

776
01:07:54,867 --> 01:07:58,745
You don't have a clue, do you?
You don't even know who you are.

777
01:07:58,871 --> 01:08:00,122
Yes, I do.

778
01:08:00,247 --> 01:08:03,876
I don't have amnesia. I remember
everything right up until the incident.

779
01:08:04,001 --> 01:08:06,003
I am Leonard Shelby,
I am from San Francisco…

780
01:08:06,128 --> 01:08:08,130
That's who you were.

781
01:08:08,255 --> 01:08:11,800
You do not know who you are.
What you've become since…

782
01:08:12,467 --> 01:08:14,469
… the incident.

783
01:08:14,845 --> 01:08:19,516
You wander around playing detective.
You don't even know how long ago it was.

784
01:08:20,809 --> 01:08:25,397
Let me put it this way. Were you wearing
designer suits when you sold insurance?

785
01:08:25,522 --> 01:08:29,234
- I didn't sell insurance, I investigated it.
- Right, right. You're an investigator.

786
01:08:30,027 --> 01:08:34,740
- Maybe you should investigate yourself.
- Oh, thank you for the advice.

787
01:08:36,658 --> 01:08:39,494
Look, do me a favour,
don't go back in there.

788
01:08:40,245 --> 01:08:43,332
Will you take the motel out of town?

789
01:08:45,918 --> 01:08:48,253
It's been fun, Lenny.

790
01:08:54,927 --> 01:08:56,929
Do not trust her.

791
01:08:58,639 --> 01:09:00,641
Don't believe his lies.

792
01:09:14,112 --> 01:09:16,782
Oh, fuck it. I need my own place.

793
01:09:17,449 --> 01:09:19,451
<font color="#40a040">[starts engine]</font>

794
01:09:22,913 --> 01:09:25,666
No. She shouldn't have given me
that responsibility.

795
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:28,502
I'm a claims investigator, not a doctor.

796
01:09:30,838 --> 01:09:33,048
Yeah, yeah, I guess.

797
01:09:33,173 --> 01:09:35,759
I've got all sorts of other considerations.

798
01:09:36,844 --> 01:09:39,304
Legal responsibility, large financ…

799
01:09:43,517 --> 01:09:46,562
- Who is this?
- <font color="#40a040">[line goes dead]</font>

800
01:09:57,573 --> 01:09:58,824
Write this down.
Write down what happened.

801
01:09:58,949 --> 01:10:02,452
Write it down. Come on, concentrate.
Keep it in mind. Find a p…

802
01:10:08,834 --> 01:10:11,670
- What happened?
- He beat the shit out of me.

803
01:10:11,795 --> 01:10:13,172
Who?

804
01:10:13,422 --> 01:10:14,798
Who?

805
01:10:15,048 --> 01:10:17,467
Fuck, Leonard, Dodd!
Dodd beat the shit out of me.

806
01:10:17,593 --> 01:10:18,677
Why?

807
01:10:18,802 --> 01:10:22,222
Because of you! Because I did what
you told me to do, reason with him,…

808
01:10:22,347 --> 01:10:25,893
- … tell him about Teddy. Great idea!
- Calm down. Calm down, take it easy.

809
01:10:26,018 --> 01:10:27,811
You're safe. It's OK.

810
01:10:29,354 --> 01:10:32,691
Come on. Just sit down. Sit down.

811
01:10:33,942 --> 01:10:36,069
Here, sit down.

812
01:10:36,612 --> 01:10:38,614
OK. You're OK.

813
01:10:38,739 --> 01:10:41,575
I'll just get some ice for your face.

814
01:10:48,707 --> 01:10:50,417
Here.

815
01:10:56,465 --> 01:10:59,510
I did exactly what you told me to do.

816
01:10:59,635 --> 01:11:01,720
I went to Dodd…

817
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:07,059
… and I told him
that I didn't have any of Jimmy's money,…

818
01:11:07,434 --> 01:11:09,436
… or the drugs.

819
01:11:09,561 --> 01:11:13,857
And that this Teddy
must have taken everything.

820
01:11:13,982 --> 01:11:15,567
And what did he say?

821
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:19,154
He didn't believe me.

822
01:11:21,114 --> 01:11:24,368
He said if I don't have the drugs
by tomorrow, he's gonna kill me.

823
01:11:24,493 --> 01:11:28,455
And then he just…
he just started hitting me.

824
01:11:29,331 --> 01:11:31,333
Where is he?

825
01:11:31,458 --> 01:11:34,336
- Why?
- I'll go see him.

826
01:11:34,461 --> 01:11:38,674
I'll give him some bruises of his own
and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.

827
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:41,218
Oh, he'll kill you, Lenny.

828
01:11:43,595 --> 01:11:46,640
- My wife used to call me Lenny.
- Yeah?

829
01:11:48,225 --> 01:11:50,227
Yeah, I hated it.

830
01:11:50,936 --> 01:11:55,274
Oh, this guy is so dangerous.
Let's just think of something else, OK?

831
01:11:56,024 --> 01:11:59,695
No, no, no.
You just tell me what he looks like.

832
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:02,322
And where I can find him.
Have you got a pen?

833
01:12:03,282 --> 01:12:05,284
In my purse.

834
01:12:14,543 --> 01:12:17,212
He'll, um,… he'll probably find you.

835
01:12:17,337 --> 01:12:18,589
What do you mean?

836
01:12:18,714 --> 01:12:20,632
I told him about your car.

837
01:12:20,757 --> 01:12:22,384
Why?

838
01:12:23,802 --> 01:12:26,847
He was beating the shit out of me,
I had to tell him something.

839
01:12:28,515 --> 01:12:30,559
Just write it all down.

840
01:12:45,741 --> 01:12:47,743
Be careful.

841
01:12:47,993 --> 01:12:49,995
I'll be fine.

842
01:12:57,127 --> 01:13:00,088
- A car this nice you should lock.
- Who the fuck are you?

843

845
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:20,108
Front desk? Burt, right.
This is Mr Shelby in room 21 .

846
01:13:21,193 --> 01:13:23,195
Yeah, that's it, I don't want any calls.

847
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:25,322
No, none at all.

848

<font color="#40a040">[door opens]</font>

849
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:38,293
- What's wrong?
- Somebody's come already.

850
01:13:38,377 --> 01:13:40,420
- Who?
- Calls himself Dodd.

851
01:13:40,504 --> 01:13:41,922
What does he want?

852
01:13:42,047 --> 01:13:44,967
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy
and his money. He thinks I took it.

853
01:13:45,092 --> 01:13:46,134
Did you?

854
01:13:47,177 --> 01:13:48,554
No.

855
01:13:52,474 --> 01:13:56,270
- What's this all about?
- You don't have a fucking clue, do you?

856
01:13:56,395 --> 01:13:58,480
You're just blissfully ignorant, aren't you?

857
01:13:58,605 --> 01:14:02,317
- Look, I have this condition.
- I know all about your fucking condition!

858
01:14:02,401 --> 01:14:05,946
I probably know more about it than you,
you don't have a clue about anything else.

859
01:14:06,071 --> 01:14:09,908
- What happened?
- Jimmy went to meet a guy named Teddy.

860
01:14:10,033 --> 01:14:12,703
He took a lot of money with him
and never came back.

861
01:14:12,744 --> 01:14:15,747
Jimmy's partners think I set him up.
I don't know if you know this Teddy.

862
01:14:15,831 --> 01:14:19,042
- Neither do I.
- Don't protect him! Help me.

863
01:14:19,168 --> 01:14:22,212
- How?
- Get rid of Dodd for me.

864
01:14:22,337 --> 01:14:24,756
- What?
- Kill him. I'll pay you.

865
01:14:24,882 --> 01:14:27,885
What do you think I am?
I'm not gonna kill someone for money.

866
01:14:28,010 --> 01:14:31,680
What, then? Love?
What would you kill for?

867
01:14:31,805 --> 01:14:34,474
- You'd kill for your wife, wouldn't you?
- That's different.

868
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:38,228
- Not to me, I wasn't married to her!
- Hey, don't talk about my wife.

869
01:14:38,353 --> 01:14:40,355
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want!

870
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:42,900
I can say whatever I want
and you won't remember!

871
01:14:42,983 --> 01:14:45,152
I can call your wife a fucking whore
and we can still be friends.

872
01:14:45,277 --> 01:14:46,862
- Calm down.
- You can't get scared!

873
01:14:46,987 --> 01:14:49,656
You don't know how, you fucking idiot!

874
01:14:49,781 --> 01:14:51,742
This has nothing to do with me.

875
01:14:51,867 --> 01:14:55,787
How the fuck would you know?
You don't know a fucking thing!

876
01:14:55,913 --> 01:14:59,124
- Hey, can you get angry?
- Yes.

877
01:14:59,249 --> 01:15:01,502
You pathetic piece of shit!

878
01:15:01,627 --> 01:15:07,174
I can say whatever the fuck I want and
you won't have a clue, you fucking retard!

879
01:15:07,299 --> 01:15:11,386
I'm gonna use you. I'm telling you now
because I'm gonna enjoy it much more…

880
01:15:11,512 --> 01:15:15,557
… if I know that you could stop me
if you weren't such a fucking freak.

881
01:15:15,682 --> 01:15:18,143
Did you lose your pen? Too bad, freak.

882
01:15:18,268 --> 01:15:22,231
Otherwise you could write yourself a note
about how much Natalie hates your guts…

883
01:15:22,356 --> 01:15:24,233
… and that I called your wife a whore!

884
01:15:24,358 --> 01:15:26,318
- Don't say another fucking word!
- About your whore of a wife?

885
01:15:30,322 --> 01:15:33,033
I read about your condition, Leonard.

886
01:15:33,116 --> 01:15:38,539
You know one of the causes of short-term
memory loss? Venereal disease.

887
01:15:38,664 --> 01:15:40,457
Maybe your cunt of a fucking wife…

888
01:15:40,582 --> 01:15:44,294
… sucked one too many diseased cocks
and turned you into a retard!

891
01:15:57,391 --> 01:16:00,060
We'll still be best friends.

892
01:16:00,644 --> 01:16:02,980
Or maybe even lovers.

893
01:16:05,399 --> 01:16:06,400
Fuck!

894
01:16:11,572 --> 01:16:13,574
I'll see you soon.

895
01:16:20,622 --> 01:16:22,624
- <font color="#40a040">[door opens and closes]</font>
- Stay focused.

896
01:16:22,749 --> 01:16:24,751
Find a pen.

897
01:16:24,877 --> 01:16:27,296
I'm gonna write this down.
I'm gonna write it down.

Concentrate, concentrate, concentrate.

01:16:32,301 --> 01:16:35,762
Keep it in mind,
keep it in mind, keep it in mind.

900
01:16:38,098 --> 01:16:40,434
Come on. I've got to find a pen.
I've got to find a pen.

901
01:16:40,559 --> 01:16:44,479
Now, write this down, write this down.
Exactly what happened.

902
01:16:44,605 --> 01:16:47,316
I'm gonna write down what happened.
Come on, come on! I've got to find a pen!

903
01:16:47,441 --> 01:16:50,402
Jeez! Come on! Come on, keep focused.

904
01:16:50,527 --> 01:16:51,361
Keep focused.

905
01:16:51,904 --> 01:16:55,157
Keep… Keep it in mind.
Come on, find a pen.

906
01:16:55,282 --> 01:16:57,784
Write this note.
Write down what happened. Write it down.

907
01:16:57,910 --> 01:17:00,204
Come on, concentrate.
Keep it in mind. Find a p…

908
01:17:08,921 --> 01:17:10,005
What happened?

909
01:17:10,088 --> 01:17:12,132
What does it look like?
He beat the shit out of me.

910
01:17:12,257 --> 01:17:14,259
- Who?
- Who?

911
01:17:14,384 --> 01:17:17,679
Fuck, Leonard, Dodd!
Dodd beat the shit out of me.

912
01:17:26,438 --> 01:17:28,440
- <font color="#40a040">[knock at door]</font>
- Hello?

913
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:34,071
It's Burt, from the front desk.

914
01:17:35,781 --> 01:17:37,157
Yeah?

915
01:17:37,282 --> 01:17:41,578
I know you said you didn't want any calls
but this guy on the phone says he's a cop.

916
01:17:41,703 --> 01:17:43,705
- A cop?
- Yeah.

917
01:17:43,830 --> 01:17:47,042
He says you're really gonna wanna know
what he has to say.

918
01:17:47,167 --> 01:17:50,420
I'm not too good on the phone.
I need to look people in the eye.

919
01:17:50,546 --> 01:17:52,047
Well, what…

920
01:17:55,884 --> 01:17:58,929
You can, um, you can crash on the couch.

921
01:17:59,012 --> 01:18:01,890
It's comfortable. Just have a seat.

922
01:18:02,015 --> 01:18:03,809
Thanks.

923
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:11,149
So, how long do you think
it's gonna take you?

924
01:18:11,608 --> 01:18:12,609
Hm?

925
01:18:12,734 --> 01:18:16,196
You told me you were looking
for the guy who killed your wife.

926
01:18:16,738 --> 01:18:22,578
Oh, it depends on if he's here in town
or if he's moved on. I have my file here.

927
01:18:24,496 --> 01:18:26,498
Can I ask you something?

928
01:18:26,623 --> 01:18:32,004
If you have all that information,
why haven't the police found him for you?

929
01:18:32,337 --> 01:18:35,424
- They're not looking for him.
- Why not?

930
01:18:35,507 --> 01:18:37,092
They don't think he exists.

931
01:18:38,427 --> 01:18:44,391
You see, I told them what I remembered.
I was asleep. Something woke me up.

932
01:18:48,228 --> 01:18:50,022
<font color="#40a040">[clock ticks]</font>

933
01:18:50,105 --> 01:18:53,817
Her side of the bed was cold.
She'd obviously been gone for a while.

934
01:19:04,745 --> 01:19:06,163
<font color="#40a040">[muffled cry]</font>

935
01:19:06,288 --> 01:19:07,623
<font color="#40a040">[muffled cry]</font>

936
01:19:22,971 --> 01:19:24,306
<font color="#40a040">[muffled cry]</font>

937
01:19:30,229 --> 01:19:31,188
<font color="#40a040">[crash]</font>

938
01:19:52,125 --> 01:19:54,628
There had to be a second man.

939
01:19:54,837 --> 01:19:57,297
Somebody hit me from behind.
I remember.

940
01:19:57,422 --> 01:19:59,049
It's the last thing I do remember.

941
01:19:59,174 --> 01:20:01,844
Look, the police didn't believe me.
If we check…

942
01:20:01,969 --> 01:20:05,764
How did they explain what you
do remember? The gun and stuff?

943
01:20:08,642 --> 01:20:10,644
John G was clever.

944
01:20:11,019 --> 01:20:12,813
He was clever.

945
01:20:12,938 --> 01:20:17,860
He took the dead man's gun and
replaced it with the sap he hit me with.

946
01:20:17,985 --> 01:20:22,072
He left my gun and the getaway car.
He gave the police a complete package.

947
01:20:22,197 --> 01:20:26,869
They found the sap with my blood on it
in the dead man's hand.

948
01:20:26,994 --> 01:20:29,371
And they only found my gun.

949
01:20:29,496 --> 01:20:32,332
They didn't need to look for anybody else.

950
01:20:32,666 --> 01:20:36,295
I was the only guy who disagreed
with the facts and I had brain damage.

951
01:20:36,795 --> 01:20:39,214
The cops are not gonna believe
someone in my condition.

952
01:20:39,965 --> 01:20:44,136
Leonard. You can stay here
for a couple of days if it will help you.

953
01:20:44,761 --> 01:20:46,805
Oh, thanks.

954
01:20:46,972 --> 01:20:51,518
I have to go back to work,
so, um, just make yourself at home.

955
01:20:51,643 --> 01:20:54,062
You can watch TV or have some food.

956
01:20:54,146 --> 01:20:56,690
Whatever you want, OK?
Make yourself at home.

957
01:20:56,815 --> 01:20:58,317
One thing.

958
01:21:01,653 --> 01:21:06,283
- Something to remember you by.
- My name is Natalie.

959
01:21:07,826 --> 01:21:09,870
Natalie.

960
01:21:36,897 --> 01:21:38,315
<font color="#40a040">[door opens]</font>

961
01:21:41,902 --> 01:21:43,904
- What's wrong?
- Somebody's come already.

962
01:21:44,196 --> 01:21:46,323
<font color="#40a040">[phone rings]</font>

963
01:21:49,701 --> 01:21:51,703
<font color="#40a040">[phone rings]</font>

964
01:21:54,081 --> 01:21:56,083
<font color="#40a040">[ringing stops]</font>

965
01:22:28,866 --> 01:22:30,534
<font color="#40a040">[phone rings]</font>

966
01:22:33,203 --> 01:22:36,290
- On the house.
- Thanks.

967
01:22:38,083 --> 01:22:39,418
<font color="#40a040">[laughs]</font>

968
01:22:40,627 --> 01:22:44,548
My, you really do have a problem.
Just like that cop said.

969
01:22:44,673 --> 01:22:47,968
- Hm?
- Your condition.

970
01:22:48,844 --> 01:22:51,054
Well, nobody's perfect.

971
01:22:51,889 --> 01:22:55,559
What's the last thing
that you do remember?

972
01:22:58,729 --> 01:23:00,814
- My wife.
- That's sweet.

973
01:23:00,939 --> 01:23:01,773
Dying.

974
01:23:03,734 --> 01:23:06,153
I remember my wife dying.

975
01:23:09,823 --> 01:23:12,701
Let me, um, get you another one.

976
01:23:12,826 --> 01:23:14,745
I think this one's dusty.

977
01:23:19,041 --> 01:23:21,919
Why are you calling me?
What do you want?

978
01:23:22,044 --> 01:23:25,506
I know you're a cop. What do you want?
Have I done something wrong?

979
01:23:25,839 --> 01:23:28,258
I don't know, something bad, maybe.

980
01:23:29,718 --> 01:23:32,137
Look, why are you asking me?
I can't remember what I've done.

981
01:23:32,262 --> 01:23:34,264
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

982
01:23:34,389 --> 01:23:37,309
Because of my condition, you don't
believe someone with this condition.

983
01:23:37,434 --> 01:23:40,103
Nobody believed Sammy!
I didn't even fucking believe Sammy!

984
01:23:40,979 --> 01:23:42,981
Ferdy's bar.

985
01:23:45,150 --> 01:23:47,653
Come by after. Natalie.

986
01:24:02,626 --> 01:24:04,545
- A beer, please.
- What do you want?

987
01:24:04,670 --> 01:24:05,629
A beer, please.

988
01:24:05,754 --> 01:24:08,131
You can't just waltz in here
dressed like that and ask for a beer.

989
01:24:08,215 --> 01:24:10,551
- What, is there a dress code?
- Why are you here?

990
01:24:10,676 --> 01:24:13,595
- I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
- Well, that's me.

991
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:16,390
Yeah, we met before, right?

992
01:24:17,307 --> 01:24:19,518
- Then why am I here?
- I don't know, why don't you tell me?

993
01:24:19,601 --> 01:24:21,645
I don't remember.
I have no short-term memory.

994
01:24:21,728 --> 01:24:23,522
Oh, you're that memory guy.

995
01:24:23,647 --> 01:24:27,359
- How do you know about me?
- My boyfriend told me about you.

996
01:24:27,484 --> 01:24:31,363
- Oh, yeah? Who's your boyfriend?
- Jimmy Grants. Do you know him?

997
01:24:32,614 --> 01:24:33,991
No.

998
01:24:34,116 --> 01:24:39,413
He knows you. He told me about you.
He said you were staying at the Discount.

999
01:24:39,496 --> 01:24:42,791
In fact, a cop came by earlier
and was looking for you.

1000
01:24:42,916 --> 01:24:45,002
Said he was looking for a guy
who can't remember anything,…

1001
01:24:45,127 --> 01:24:47,129
… wouldn't know how he'd got here
or what he'd done.

1002
01:24:47,254 --> 01:24:49,131
I get a lot of guys round here like that.

1003
01:24:49,256 --> 01:24:53,677
Chronic alcoholism
is one cause of short-term memory loss.

1004
01:24:55,429 --> 01:24:58,473
- Are you Teddy?
- No, my name's Leonard.

1005
01:24:58,599 --> 01:25:00,684
- Did Teddy send you?
- I don't know.

1006
01:25:01,310 --> 01:25:03,353
What's happened to Jimmy?

1007
01:25:03,437 --> 01:25:07,149
- I don't know that, either. Sorry.
- You don't remember anything?

1008
01:25:07,274 --> 01:25:10,819
You don't remember where you've been
or what you've just done?

1009
01:25:10,944 --> 01:25:14,406
I can't make new memories.
Everything just fades.

1010
01:25:14,573 --> 01:25:17,284
- Then why did you come here?
- I found this in my pocket.

1011
01:25:20,621 --> 01:25:22,706
Your pocket?

1012
01:25:37,971 --> 01:25:39,348
<font color="#40a040">[man hawks]</font>

1013
01:25:47,105 --> 01:25:49,900
Bar bet. Care to contribute?

1014
01:25:50,025 --> 01:25:52,444
- No, thanks.
- It's for a lot of money.

1015
01:25:52,861 --> 01:25:56,740
Come on. Proceeds are going to charity.
Help me out.

1016
01:26:02,079 --> 01:26:04,081
<font color="#40a040">[hawks]</font>

1017
01:26:08,126 --> 01:26:09,920
Thank you.

1018
01:26:26,854 --> 01:26:29,940
- On the house.
- Thanks.

1019
01:26:30,816 --> 01:26:32,818
<font color="#40a040">[man laughs]</font>

1020
01:26:33,819 --> 01:26:37,281
It's completely fucked
because nobody believes you.

1021
01:26:37,322 --> 01:26:41,034
It's amazing what a little brain damage
will do for your credibility.

1022
01:26:41,159 --> 01:26:43,453
I guess it's poetic justice
for not believing Sammy.

1023
01:26:43,537 --> 01:26:48,333
You know the truth about my condition,
officer? You don't know anything.

1024
01:26:48,458 --> 01:26:53,505
You feel angry, you don't know why.
You feel guilty, you have no idea why.

1025
01:26:53,630 --> 01:26:57,092
You could do anything and not have
the faintest idea ten minutes later.

1026
01:26:57,217 --> 01:27:00,179
Like Sammy.
What if I'd done something like Sammy?

1027
01:27:00,262 --> 01:27:04,183
I didn't tell you?
What happened to Sammy and his wife?

1028
01:27:04,308 --> 01:27:06,435
She came to see me at my office.

1029
01:27:06,518 --> 01:27:11,440
I didn't tell her what I really thought
but I never said that he was faking.

1030
01:27:11,565 --> 01:27:13,734
Just that his condition was mental,
not physical.

1031
01:27:13,817 --> 01:27:16,445
I found out later that she went home
and gave Sammy his final exam.

1032
01:27:18,322 --> 01:27:21,116
Sammy? It's time for my shot.

1033
01:27:37,174 --> 01:27:40,219
She knew beyond a doubt
that he loved her,

1034
01:27:40,344 --> 01:27:43,013
so she found a way to test him.

1035
01:27:55,025 --> 01:27:58,570
Sammy? It's time for my shot.

1036
01:27:59,571 --> 01:28:01,573
Hm.

1037
01:28:08,914 --> 01:28:12,626
- She really thought she'd call his bluff.
- There you go.

1038
01:28:12,751 --> 01:28:17,422
Or she just didn't want to live with
the things she'd put him through.

1039
01:28:26,181 --> 01:28:27,558
Sammy?

1040
01:28:29,768 --> 01:28:31,144
It's time for my shot.

1041
01:28:37,359 --> 01:28:39,111
It won't hurt.

1042
01:29:22,988 --> 01:29:26,241
She went into a coma
and never recovered.

1043
01:29:26,366 --> 01:29:29,578
Sammy couldn't understand
or explain what happened.

1044
01:29:29,703 --> 01:29:30,662
Oh!

1045
01:29:31,830 --> 01:29:36,251
He's been in a home ever since.
He doesn't even know his wife is dead.

1046
01:29:36,376 --> 01:29:39,713
I was wrong about Sammy
and I was wrong about his wife.

1047
01:29:39,796 --> 01:29:43,967
She wasn't interested in the money.
She needed to understand his problem.

1048
01:29:44,092 --> 01:29:47,763
His brain didn't respond to conditioning
but he wasn't a con man.

1049
01:29:47,888 --> 01:29:51,266
And when she looked into his eyes,
she thought he could be the same person.

1050
01:29:51,391 --> 01:29:53,435
When I looked into his eyes,
I thought I saw recognition.

1051
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:55,562
Now I know you fake it.

1052
01:29:55,687 --> 01:29:58,732
If you think you're supposed to recognise
somebody, you pretend to.

1053
01:29:58,857 --> 01:30:02,402
You bluff it to get a pat on the head
from the doctors.

1054
01:30:02,528 --> 01:30:05,572
You bluff it to seem less of a freak.

1055
01:30:07,324 --> 01:30:09,326
What drug dealer?

1056
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:12,162
<font color="#40a040">[tyres squeal]</font>

1057
01:30:34,935 --> 01:30:38,063
- Hey, Lenny, how you doing?
- It's private back here.

1058
01:30:38,146 --> 01:30:41,149
- It's OK, we know each other. Right, kid?
- How did you know I was in here?

1059
01:30:41,233 --> 01:30:43,235
The Jag's out front.

1060
01:30:43,318 --> 01:30:46,321
What are you still doing here, Lenny?
There's plenty of tattoo parlours up north.

1061
01:30:46,405 --> 01:30:49,908
I guess I wanted to get something down
before it slipped my mind.

1062
01:30:50,033 --> 01:30:51,952
- Give me the keys, I'll move it.
- It'll be all right.

1063
01:30:52,077 --> 01:30:54,079
- Wait out there.
- Oh, for Christ…

1064
01:30:54,204 --> 01:30:56,290
Give me a minute,
I've got to get something for you.

1065
01:31:00,961 --> 01:31:04,464
Fact six. Car licence SG13 7IU.

1066
01:31:10,846 --> 01:31:13,891
Look, wait a minute, will ya?

1067
01:31:16,602 --> 01:31:18,854
- We gotta get you out of here.
- Why?

1068
01:31:18,979 --> 01:31:21,899
Oh, man. Come on, Leonard.
How many times I gotta tell you?

1069
01:31:22,024 --> 01:31:24,443
- It's not safe for you to hang around.
- Why not?

1070
01:31:24,568 --> 01:31:27,863
Because that cop's looking for you.
I gotta get you a new identity,…

1071
01:31:27,988 --> 01:31:31,325
… some new clothes, a different car
would do for now. Put these on.

1072
01:31:31,450 --> 01:31:33,285
Whoa, whoa. What cop?

1073
01:31:33,410 --> 01:31:37,456
He's a bad cop. He's the one
that checked you into the Discount Inn.

1074
01:31:37,581 --> 01:31:41,460
He's been calling you for days, slipping
envelopes under your door, shit like that.

1075
01:31:41,585 --> 01:31:45,547
- How do you know this?
- He told me. He's been laughing at you.

1076
01:31:45,672 --> 01:31:47,049
- You're full of shit.
- No, I'm not.

1077
01:31:47,174 --> 01:31:49,176
He knows you're no good on the phone
so he's been calling you up.

1078
01:31:49,301 --> 01:31:51,261
Sometimes you don't answer the phone…

1079
01:31:51,386 --> 01:31:54,139
… so he slips shit under your door
to scare you into answering it,…

1080
01:31:54,264 --> 01:31:59,394
… giving you a line of crap about John G
being a local drug dealer. Jimmy Grants.

1081
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:02,272
- Who's Jimmy Grants?
- Leonard, Jimmy's the drug dealer.

1082
01:32:02,397 --> 01:32:05,859
The cop wants to know how his operation
is run. He's got some score in mind.

1083
01:32:05,984 --> 01:32:08,487
- Somehow you're involved.
- How do you know him?

1084
01:32:08,612 --> 01:32:14,243
I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town.
The local boys put us together.

1085
01:32:14,409 --> 01:32:16,703
If he knew I was helping you,
he'd fucking kill me.

1086
01:32:16,828 --> 01:32:20,582
So take these clothes, put them on
and get the fuck out of here.

1087
01:32:20,707 --> 01:32:22,543
Come on, Leonard, just go.

1088
01:32:42,896 --> 01:32:44,773
You are full of shit.

1089
01:32:47,651 --> 01:32:49,695
Come by after. Natalie.

1090
01:32:50,404 --> 01:32:52,281
Ferdy's bar.

1091
01:33:32,696 --> 01:33:34,072
<font color="#40a040">[knocks on window]</font>

1092
01:33:34,198 --> 01:33:36,366
Hey, Jimmy.

1093
01:33:37,993 --> 01:33:41,038
I'm sorry, I, uh,
thought you were somebody else.

1094
01:33:41,496 --> 01:33:43,290
Sorry.

1095
01:33:43,415 --> 01:33:45,417
That's OK.

1096
01:33:59,223 --> 01:34:03,227
This Jimmy Grants deals drugs
out of the bar where his girlfriend works?

1097
01:34:03,644 --> 01:34:07,314
But he's not going to bring her along?
He'll come by himself, right?

1098
01:34:07,439 --> 01:34:11,318
I always figured the drugs angle
would be the best way to get him.

1099
01:34:11,568 --> 01:34:14,947
No, officer. I'm as ready as I'll ever be.

1100
01:34:15,072 --> 01:34:17,950
You're in the lobby?
What do you look like?

1101
01:34:19,284 --> 01:34:20,202
I'll be right there.

1102
01:35:03,370 --> 01:35:04,246
Lenny!

1103
01:35:06,540 --> 01:35:08,542
Officer Gammell?

1104
01:35:11,587 --> 01:35:13,589
Yeah. Come on.

1105
01:35:30,397 --> 01:35:33,317
- Hey, smile.
- Oh, don't, uh… Not here.

1106
01:35:34,193 --> 01:35:36,195
Over here.

1107
01:35:40,741 --> 01:35:43,410
Is it Officer or Lieutenant Gammell?

1108
01:35:43,493 --> 01:35:46,455
You know what?
Don't write Gammell, just Teddy.

1109
01:35:46,580 --> 01:35:49,166
- Why?
- I'm undercover.

1110
01:35:51,919 --> 01:35:54,630
This is the directions, where he's going.

1111
01:35:54,755 --> 01:35:57,591
- My number's on the bottom if you…
- You're not coming?

1112
01:35:57,716 --> 01:36:00,469
Nah, it wouldn't be appropriate.

1113
01:36:04,473 --> 01:36:07,142
Nice picture. I look thin.

1114
01:36:09,895 --> 01:36:11,271
Hey, Lenny!

1115
01:36:12,856 --> 01:36:14,233
Make him beg.

1116
01:37:36,899 --> 01:37:38,901
Teddy!

1117
01:37:41,069 --> 01:37:42,196
Hey, Teddy!

1118
01:37:45,282 --> 01:37:47,075
Teddy!

1119
01:37:50,287 --> 01:37:52,080
Jimmy.

1120
01:37:52,581 --> 01:37:55,792
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- You Jimmy Grants?

1121
01:37:55,918 --> 01:37:57,878
Expecting any other Jimmys,
memory man?

1122
01:37:58,003 --> 01:38:02,216
- Do you remember me?
- Yeah, I remember you.

1123
01:38:02,341 --> 01:38:04,718
Where the fuck's Teddy?

1124
01:38:04,843 --> 01:38:05,886
Well?

1125
01:38:09,598 --> 01:38:11,475
Motherfuck!

1126
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:12,392
What are you doing?

1127
01:38:14,603 --> 01:38:15,771
Strip.

1128
01:38:15,896 --> 01:38:18,315
- You're making a big fucking mistake!
- Strip!

1129
01:38:19,942 --> 01:38:22,986
My associates are not the kind of people
you wanna piss off.

1130
01:38:23,111 --> 01:38:24,738
Don't say anything else.

1131
01:38:24,863 --> 01:38:27,824
- I knew I couldn't trust that fuck!
- Take it off.

1132
01:38:33,163 --> 01:38:35,165
Your pants, too.

1133
01:38:35,374 --> 01:38:37,793
- Why?
- I don't wanna get blood on them.

1134
01:38:37,918 --> 01:38:41,880
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait, wait, wait!
Did he tell you what I was bringing?

1135
01:38:42,005 --> 01:38:45,926
- Take your fuckin' pants off!
- I've got two hundred grand in the car!

1136
01:38:46,051 --> 01:38:48,720
- Just take it!
- You think you can bargain with me?

1137
01:38:48,804 --> 01:38:51,098
- Just take the money and walk away.
- I don't want your fucking money.

1138
01:38:51,223 --> 01:38:53,600
Then, what?

1139
01:38:53,725 --> 01:38:56,979
- What do you want from me?
- I want my fucking life back!

1140
01:40:28,487 --> 01:40:29,655
<font color="#40a040">[softly]</font> Sammy.

1141
01:40:36,495 --> 01:40:38,580
He said Sammy.
How does he know about Sammy?

1142
01:40:38,705 --> 01:40:40,707
Oh, fuck.

1143
01:41:00,602 --> 01:41:02,604
What have I done?

1144
01:41:03,939 --> 01:41:05,107
Hey, mister! I need help!

1145
01:41:05,232 --> 01:41:08,777
There's a guy in here, he's hurt bad.
We gotta get him to a doctor.

1146
01:41:08,902 --> 01:41:10,028
All right.

1147
01:41:11,321 --> 01:41:13,574
I don't know what happened.
I've got this memory thing.

1148
01:41:13,699 --> 01:41:16,618
- Do I know you?
- No. Don't worry, I'm a cop.

1149
01:41:16,743 --> 01:41:19,997
- Is he still breathing?
- Well, I don't know. Maybe.

1150
01:41:20,122 --> 01:41:25,085
- What the hell were you guys doing?
- I don't remember, I have this condition.

1151
01:41:25,210 --> 01:41:28,172
I hope it's not as serious as his
cos this guy's dead.

1152
01:41:28,672 --> 01:41:32,509
- Ow! Lenny! That shit kills!
- So you remember me now, huh?

1153
01:41:32,634 --> 01:41:37,222
- You are a fucking cop!
- And I'm the guy that helped you find him.

1154
01:41:37,347 --> 01:41:41,810
- Get up! Get up!
- Lenny, you got the wrong idea!

1155
01:41:44,730 --> 01:41:46,773
Who is that? He knew me.

1156
01:41:46,899 --> 01:41:49,568
Of course he did, he raped your wife,
he fucked up your brain.

1157
01:41:49,651 --> 01:41:51,653
Bullshit! He's not the guy.

1158
01:41:51,778 --> 01:41:55,616
His name is James F Grants. John G.
Check your tattoos.

1159
01:41:55,741 --> 01:41:58,410
- Why did he bring two hundred grand?
- What?

1160
01:42:00,454 --> 01:42:02,706
- What was it for?
- Amphetamines I told him I had.

1161
01:42:02,831 --> 01:42:06,376
- Is this a drug deal?
- No. Yeah, that and your thing.

1162
01:42:06,502 --> 01:42:09,963
Look, Jimmy's your guy. I figured
we'd make a few dollars on the side.

1163
01:42:10,088 --> 01:42:12,925
- How did he know me?
- The Discount Inn.

1164
01:42:13,050 --> 01:42:17,387
He dealt out of there. The guy at the front
desk let him know if anybody came round.

1165
01:42:17,513 --> 01:42:19,765
He called Jimmy
the minute he saw you taking a picture.

1166
01:42:19,890 --> 01:42:22,267
- You're fucking using me.
- No! You get half.

1167
01:42:22,392 --> 01:42:24,853
He knew about Sammy,
why would I tell him about Sammy?!

1168
01:42:24,978 --> 01:42:28,315
You tell everybody about Sammy!
Everybody who'll listen!

1169
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:30,526
''Remember Sammy Jankis?''
''Remember Sammy Jankis?''

1170
01:42:30,651 --> 01:42:33,529
Great story.
Gets better every time you tell it.

1171
01:42:33,820 --> 01:42:37,699
So you lie to yourself to be happy.
There's nothing wrong with that.

1172
01:42:37,824 --> 01:42:41,745
We all do it. Who cares if there's a few
little details you'd rather not remember?

1173
01:42:43,080 --> 01:42:46,542
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- I don't know.

1174
01:42:46,667 --> 01:42:51,463
Your wife surviving the assault.
Her not believing your condition.

1175
01:42:51,588 --> 01:42:55,467
The torment and pain and anguish
tearing her up inside.

1176
01:42:56,844 --> 01:42:58,095
The insulin.

1177
01:42:59,429 --> 01:43:02,099
That's Sammy, not me.
I told you about Sammy.

1178
01:43:02,224 --> 01:43:05,185
Yeah, right.
Like you tell yourself over and over again.

1179
01:43:05,310 --> 01:43:08,772
Condtitioning yourself to remember,
learning through repetition.

1180
01:43:08,897 --> 01:43:11,692
Sammy let his wife kill herself.
Sammy ended up in an institution.

1181
01:43:11,817 --> 01:43:15,070
Sammy was a con man. A faker.

1182
01:43:15,195 --> 01:43:17,322
I never said that Sammy was faking.

1183
01:43:17,447 --> 01:43:20,284
You exposed him for what he was.
A fraud.

1184
01:43:20,409 --> 01:43:22,411
I was wrong. That's the whole point.

1185
01:43:23,620 --> 01:43:26,832
- See, Sammy's wife came to me…
- Sammy didn't have a wife.

1186
01:43:29,585 --> 01:43:32,421
It was your wife who had diabetes.

1187
01:43:38,343 --> 01:43:39,303
Ouch!

1188
01:43:41,471 --> 01:43:43,599
My wife wasn't diabetic.

1189
01:43:44,391 --> 01:43:46,393
You sure?

1190
01:43:50,856 --> 01:43:52,774
Ouch! Cut it out!

1191
01:43:52,900 --> 01:43:54,902
She wasn't diabetic.

1192
01:43:55,027 --> 01:43:58,739
You think I don't know my own wife?
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1193
01:43:58,864 --> 01:44:01,992
I guess I can only make you remember
the things you want to be true.

1194
01:44:01,992 --> 01:44:04,703
- Like old Jimmy down there.
- He's not the right guy.

1195
01:44:04,828 --> 01:44:06,955
He was to you.

1196
01:44:07,080 --> 01:44:10,417
Come on, you got your revenge.
Enjoy it while you still remember.

1197
01:44:10,542 --> 01:44:13,045
What difference does it make
whether he was your guy or not?

1198
01:44:13,170 --> 01:44:15,255
- It makes all the difference.
- Why? You're never gonna know.

1199
01:44:15,380 --> 01:44:17,132
- Yes, I will.
- No, you won't.

1200
01:44:17,257 --> 01:44:19,635
- Somehow I'll know.
- You won't remember!

1201
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:21,178
When it's done, I will know.

1202
01:44:21,303 --> 01:44:24,348
I thought so, too, I was sure of it,
but you didn't!

1203
01:44:28,060 --> 01:44:32,981
That's right. The real John G.
I helped you find him over a year ago.

1204
01:44:33,106 --> 01:44:35,943
- He's already dead.
- Don't lie to me any more.

1205
01:44:36,068 --> 01:44:38,111
Look, Lenny,…

1206
01:44:38,237 --> 01:44:41,406
… I was the cop assigned
to your wife's case, I believed you.

1207
01:44:41,532 --> 01:44:43,992
I thought you deserved
a chance for revenge.

1208
01:44:44,117 --> 01:44:47,454
I'm the one that helped you find
the other guy in your bathroom that night.

1209
01:44:47,579 --> 01:44:49,790
The guy that cracked your skull
and fucked your wife.

1210
01:44:49,915 --> 01:44:52,292
We found him, you killed him.

1211
01:44:54,044 --> 01:44:55,838
But you didn't remember.

1212
01:44:56,505 --> 01:45:01,635
So I helped you start looking again,
looking for the guy you already killed.

1213
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:06,431
- Oh, yeah? So who was he?
- Just some guy. Does it matter who?

1214
01:45:06,557 --> 01:45:11,061
No reason, Lenny, no conspiracy,
just bad fucking luck.

1215
01:45:11,395 --> 01:45:14,857
Couple of junkies too strung out
to realise your wife didn't live alone.

1216
01:45:16,692 --> 01:45:20,779
But when you killed him
I was so convinced that you'd remember.

1217
01:45:21,572 --> 01:45:24,032
But it didn't stick.

1218
01:45:24,157 --> 01:45:26,326
Like nothing ever sticks,
like this won't stick.

1219
01:45:30,622 --> 01:45:32,624
I took that picture.

1220
01:45:32,916 --> 01:45:34,918
Just when you did it.

1221
01:45:37,713 --> 01:45:42,676
Look how happy you are.
I wanted to see that face again.

1222
01:45:42,801 --> 01:45:45,262
- Oh, gee, thanks!
- Fuck you.

1223
01:45:45,387 --> 01:45:49,391
I gave you a reason to live
and you were more than happy to help.

1224
01:45:49,516 --> 01:45:55,272
You don't want the truth. You make up
your own truth, like your police file.

1225
01:45:56,023 --> 01:45:59,067
It was complete when I gave it to you.
Who took out the twelve pages?

1226
01:45:59,193 --> 01:46:00,527
You, probably.

1227
01:46:00,652 --> 01:46:03,030
- No, it wasn't me, see, it was you.
- Why would I do that?

1228
01:46:03,155 --> 01:46:05,949
To create a puzzle you could never solve.

1229
01:46:06,074 --> 01:46:08,035
Do you know how many towns,…

1230
01:46:08,160 --> 01:46:12,331
… how many John Gs or James Gs?
I mean, shit, Lenny, I'm a fucking John G.

1231
01:46:12,456 --> 01:46:15,626
- Your name's Teddy.
- My mother calls me Teddy.

1232
01:46:15,751 --> 01:46:17,753
My name's John Edward Gammell.

1233
01:46:17,878 --> 01:46:22,591
Cheer up. There's plenty of John Gs
for us to find.

1234
01:46:26,136 --> 01:46:30,474
All you do is moan! I'm the one
that has to live with what you've done.

1235
01:46:30,599 --> 01:46:32,601
I'm the one that put it all together.

1236
01:46:32,726 --> 01:46:37,356
You, you wander around, you're playing
detective. You're living a dream, kid.

1237
01:46:37,481 --> 01:46:40,442
A dead wife to pine for,
a sense of purpose to your life,…

1238
01:46:40,567 --> 01:46:44,947
… a romantic quest that you wouldn't end
even if I wasn't in the picture.

1239
01:46:46,281 --> 01:46:49,409
- I should kill you.
- Quit it! Lenny, come on.

1240
01:46:49,535 --> 01:46:52,496
You're not a killer.
That's why you're so good at it.

1241
01:46:54,665 --> 01:46:56,667
Come on, what are you doing?

1242
01:46:56,792 --> 01:47:00,963
You know what time it is?
It's beer o'clock, I'm buying.

1243
01:47:02,756 --> 01:47:04,758
Fuck!

1244
01:47:14,226 --> 01:47:15,269
I'm not a killer.

1245
01:47:16,645 --> 01:47:20,065
I'm just someone
who wanted to make things right.

1246
01:47:24,403 --> 01:47:28,323
Can I just let myself forget
what you've told me?

1247
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:46,842
Can I just let myself forget
what you made me do?

1248
01:48:02,482 --> 01:48:07,154
You think I just want another puzzle
to solve? Another John G to look for?

1249
01:48:07,279 --> 01:48:09,531
You're a John G.

1250
01:48:12,034 --> 01:48:14,077
So you can be my John G.

1251
01:48:22,461 --> 01:48:25,297
Do I lie to myself to be happy?

1252
01:48:25,422 --> 01:48:26,715
In your case, Teddy,…

1253
01:48:28,884 --> 01:48:30,886
… yes, I will.

1254
01:48:43,482 --> 01:48:45,484
Hey! Hey, that's not your car!

1255
01:48:45,609 --> 01:48:48,654
- It is now.
- Jesus Christ, you can't take it!

1256
01:48:48,779 --> 01:48:51,073
- Why not?
- Because the guy you just killed owns it!

1257
01:48:51,198 --> 01:48:53,450
Somebody'll recognise it.

1258
01:48:54,910 --> 01:48:57,996
You know, I think I'd rather
be mistaken for a dead guy than a killer.

1259
01:48:58,997 --> 01:49:01,458
I might hang on to this for a while.

1260
01:49:02,334 --> 01:49:04,169
Lenny.

1261
01:49:04,294 --> 01:49:06,797
Look, don't…
Will you help me find the keys?

1262
01:49:07,965 --> 01:49:09,967
Help me find my keys!

1263
01:49:10,092 --> 01:49:10,884
Lenny!

1264
01:49:17,307 --> 01:49:18,141
Lenny!

1265
01:49:32,281 --> 01:49:35,659
I have to believe in a world
outside my own mind.

1266
01:49:35,784 --> 01:49:37,786
I have to believe
that my actions still have meaning.

1267
01:49:37,911 --> 01:49:40,831
Even if I can't remember them.

1268
01:49:41,582 --> 01:49:46,837
I have to believe that when my eyes
are closed, the world's still here.

1269
01:49:48,088 --> 01:49:50,424
Do I believe the world's still here?

1270
01:49:53,427 --> 01:49:54,928
Is it still out there?

1271
01:49:58,098 --> 01:49:59,808
Yeah.

1272
01:50:02,227 --> 01:50:04,938
We all need memories
to remind ourselves who we are.

1273
01:50:07,357 --> 01:50:09,026
I'm no different.

1274
01:50:12,070 --> 01:50:13,447
<font color="#40a040">[tyres screech]</font>

1275
01:50:21,622 --> 01:50:23,290
Now, where was I?

1276
01:50:32,508 --> 01:50:35,552
♫ We lay in each other's arms ♫

1277
01:50:38,222 --> 01:50:41,433
♫ But the room is just an empty space ♫

1278
01:50:42,267 --> 01:50:44,770
♫ I guess we lived it out ♫

1279
01:50:46,021 --> 01:50:48,732
♫ Something in the air ♫

1280
01:50:49,483 --> 01:50:51,026
♫ We smile too fast ♫

1281
01:50:51,151 --> 01:50:54,613
♫ Then can't think of a thing to say ♫

1282
01:50:56,615 --> 01:50:59,201
♫ Lived with the best times ♫

1283
01:51:01,870 --> 01:51:03,872
♫ Left with the worst ♫

1284
01:51:06,917 --> 01:51:10,587
♫ I've danced with you too long ♫

1285
01:51:13,257 --> 01:51:15,425
♫ Nothing left to save ♫

1286
01:51:16,093 --> 01:51:21,014
♫ There's something in the air ♫

1287
01:51:21,932 --> 01:51:25,769
♫ Something in my eye ♫

1288
01:51:25,936 --> 01:51:30,023
♫ I've danced with you too long ♫

1289
01:51:31,275 --> 01:51:33,277
♫ Yeah ♫

1290
01:51:33,777 --> 01:51:37,698
♫ Something in the air ♫

1291
01:51:38,282 --> 01:51:42,452
♫ Something in my eye ♫

1292
01:51:54,631 --> 01:51:56,758
♫ Abracadoo ♫

1293
01:51:56,967 --> 01:51:58,969
♫ I lose you ♫

1294
01:52:00,637 --> 01:52:03,307
♫ We can't avoid the clash ♫

1295
01:52:03,557 --> 01:52:05,559
♫ The big mistake ♫

1296
01:52:07,561 --> 01:52:09,813
♫ Now we're gonna pay and pay ♫

1297
01:52:11,982 --> 01:52:17,237
♫ I guess you know ♫
♫ I never wanted anyone more than you ♫

1298
01:52:18,822 --> 01:52:21,617
♫ Lived all our best times ♫

1299
01:52:24,244 --> 01:52:26,788
♫ Left with the worst ♫

1300
01:52:29,333 --> 01:52:32,878
♫ I've danced with you too long ♫

1301
01:52:35,547 --> 01:52:38,133
♫ Say what you will ♫

1302
01:52:38,258 --> 01:52:43,805
♫ But there's something in the air ♫

1303
01:52:46,183 --> 01:52:48,644
♫ Something in my eye ♫

1304
01:52:48,769 --> 01:52:53,273
♫ I've danced with you too long ♫

1305
01:52:56,235 --> 01:52:59,613
♫ There's something I have to say ♫

1306
01:53:00,489 --> 01:53:04,743
♫ There's something in the air ♫

1307
01:53:05,160 --> 01:53:09,289
♫ I've danced with you too long ♫
