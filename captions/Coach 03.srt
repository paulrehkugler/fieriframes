1
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,620
You've planned this
from the beginning.

2
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,390
In one month, you're going
to force the responsibility

3
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,400
of the factory shutdown
on me, right?

4
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,430
Hurry and close down
that distressed factory.

5
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,340
You have no right
to order me around.

6
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,740
Why don't you quit
and find another job?

7
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:55,510
Or will you rebuild
the factory?

8
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,940
Are you going
to be our coach?

9
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,430
I won't allow you to
play baseball, anymore.

10
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,140
You're going to work.

11
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm going to work
you to the ground.

12
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,980
I'll create my own destiny.

13
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,130
What are you doing?

14
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,890
I found it!

15
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,840
Mom thought it was
unusual, and bought it.

16
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,670
How nostalgic.

17
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,580
Is that for the factory chief?

18
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,000
Forget it!

19
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,570
She hates fish...

20
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,280
Does milk go with toast?

21
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,580
She didn't like
your meddling.

22
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,160
All the more reason
I want to do it.

23
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:43,560
l was a catcher
so it's a habit.

24
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,330
Good morning.

25
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,540
Will you have some toast?

26
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,190
I'm not hungry.

27
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,530
Do you have a fever?

28
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,640
This town makes me
lose my appetite.

29
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,310
She's back.

30
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,080
Good morning.

31
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,190
Why are you
all gathered?

32
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,490
It's our morning exercises.

33
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,860
Forget it. Get to work.

34
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,340
You must participate
or it won't look good.

35
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,130
I don't want to.

36
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,270
Please!

37
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,530
We're all here.

38
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,210
The radio exercises
shall begin!

39
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,070
Breathing exercises...

40
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,970
Arms and legs...

41
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:31,420
Please join us!
It feels good!

42
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,230
What an 
invigorating morning!

43
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,840
Please give us our
morning instructions!

44
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:59,260
Be prepared. I'm
reorganizing this factory.

45
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,770
As of today, we'll
do things my way.

46
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,980
Let's play ball!

47
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,370
Excuse me...

48
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,170
What is it?

49
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:25,460
You said you're
reorganizing...

50
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:30,910
Do as you please, but...

51
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,640
Speak clearly!
You're wasting time.

52
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,910
I'm sorry.

53
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:39,800
Basically, what are
you going to do?

54
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,330
There's only one of
two reasons for the

55
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,360
operating deficit.
Either internal or external.

56
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,050
It is clearly an
internal cause.

57
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:51,870
What is that
internal...something?

58
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:55,050
In other words, the
cause lies internally.

59
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,410
So...?

60
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,260
It's you people.

61
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,010
Are we the cause?

62
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,010
Acknowledging it
won't help!

63
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,600
I've examined the
company's financial

64
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:06,590
statements and books.

65
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:09,170
Cost management
does not exist!

66
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,200
It's those difficult
words again...

67
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,470
Productivity and earnings
are low. The cause

68
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,660
is reckless operating costs.

69
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:18,440
I have a headache.

70
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,990
It's a long-standing system.
It can't be changed

71
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,930
so easily.

72
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,080
I'll change it.

73
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,070
You're only here
for one month.

74
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,450
Don't cause trouble.
It's an inconvenience.

75
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:43,950
I won't allow complaints.
I've decided.

76
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,050
Why are you
being so obstinate?

77
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,520
You've been acting
strange, since yesterday.

78
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,450
Did the main
office order this?

79
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,860
No, they haven't
no reason why they would.

80
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,040
That's crap!

81
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,010
She's being
obstinate, after all.

82
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:04,970
Reorganizing...
Is it possible?

83
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,850
We'll begin with
simple matters.

84
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:09,880
For example, a cut in
wages...the part-timers

85
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,140
I feel sorry for
the old ladies...

86
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,930
Think about yourself.

87
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,440
She said cut in wages

88
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,580
Wages...Us...?

89
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,650
Who's the baseball
team's manager?

90
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,140
I am...I'm the general affairs
manager, so the uniforms

91
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,880
and stuff are my job. That's
why I'm the team manager.

92
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,510
I'll make it easy for you.

93
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,810
Team expenses are
unnecessary. Cut it.

94
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,750
Dissolve the team.

95
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,100
It's not your
decision!

96
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,080
Why must it be dissolved?

97
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,980
That's why productivity
has been declining.

98
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,000
Say it in laymen terms!

99
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,570
Frankly, your work is
poor because you play

100
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,190
baseball all the time!

101
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,520
Now I'm satisfied!

102
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,850
That won't help!

103
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,480
Are you denying
the employees

104
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,220
any recreation?
You have no right!

105
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,880
Poor workers have no
right to claim recreation!

106
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,970
What are we going to do?

107
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,830
We've been doing
what's expected.

108
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,450
I wonder?

109
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,400
It's just that there
isn't much do.

110
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,890
You knew.

111
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,960
The deficit is due to
the employment

112
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,450
of unnecessary staff.

113
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,930
This factory must rearrange
its personnel.

114
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,030
Is someone to be laid off?

115
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,950
Lay off? Dissolving the
baseball team?

116
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,510
Is someone going
to be fired?

117
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,640
Dissolve the team...?

118
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,170
Not play baseball?

119
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,740
If l get fired, there's no job.

120
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,000
Think about baseball.

121
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,850
They are one and the same.

122
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,460
If you get fired, you
can't play baseball.

123
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,540
Damn!

124
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,680
Quiet down!

125
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,850
Let's create a union.

126
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,190
A union?

127
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,090
Let's do it!

128
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,780
You're a paragon
of laborers.

129
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,610
What is the procedure...?

130
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,980
What is the cost?

131
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:32,680
Let's make a flag.

132
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,280
A spring offensive!

133
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,630
What is the purpose
of a union?

134
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,340
They perform labor-management
negotiations.

135
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,950
I don't understand,
but let's do it.

136
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:48,230
Please do it, Manager.

137
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:51,380
Leave everything to me.

138
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,580
She's a very capable
woman. She can't

139
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:54,980
be treated like mackerel.

140
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:59,950
No one will be fired and
we'll play baseball...

141
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,930
As long as we don't
go bankrupt.

142
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:19,700
Pardon me.

143
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:23,490
Pardon me.

144
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,200
Manager, I'll be leaving.

145
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,030
You may stay here.
We're colleagues.

146
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,080
How is the international
telephone circuit service?

147
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,610
We obtained authorization.

148
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,980
We've started sales
to circuit companies

149
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,120
that service Japan
and America.

150
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,110
I'm glad.

151
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,640
I understand you'll
be involved in the

152
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,950
personnel shuffle, Manager Nagamine.

153
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,750
He'll be the head
of this audit office,

154
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:44,830
as of next week.

155
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,600
Movement is so
troublesome.

156
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,580
I'd like to do it
numerous times...

157
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,270
Of course, only if it's
an advantageous move.

158
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,280
Let me get to the point.

159
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,870
The director wanted me
to recruit top-notched staff.

160
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,700
That's why she's here.

161
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,660
I'll be in charge of
the new Thailand Marine

162
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,930
Product Factory.

163
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:16,430
I want you to be
my right hand man.

164
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,740
Me?

165
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:22,450
You'll get busier. This will
be the nucleus

166
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:26,690
of the company. I believe
it's an advantageous move.

167
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:33,150
I accept.

168
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,780
Please get Mr. Iwase
a cup of coffee.

169
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:48,030
As a colleague...
I'd like your opinion.

170
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,280
It's regarding
the dissolution

171
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,640
of a local factory...

172
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,540
Factory Chief!

173
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,350
Please wait one moment.

174
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,460
Are you going home?

175
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:24,540
It feels like a drama,
walking like this.

176
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:30,910
Silently walking is
like a love drama.

177
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,930
What do you want!

178
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,380
I want to talk to you.

179
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,310
Don't get personal.

180
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,780
It's not about you.
It's the baseball club.

181
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,420
What's so funny!

182
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,210
Let's have a drink.

183
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,500
We can discuss it here.

184
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:56,010
Please...please have
a drink with me.

185
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,560
I beg you.

186
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,730
How's this place?

187
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,230
This is all you've got.

188
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,170
Busted!

189
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,950
Please go in.

190
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,360
Welcome, Manager.

191
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:37,040
The Factory Chief, too?

192
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,570
Your name is
Kubota Nagisa, right?

193
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,510
A single woman
from Tokyo...

194
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:47,100
The whole town is
talking about you...

195
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,980
I'm thrilled to tears.

196
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,500
Please have a drink.

197
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,500
Please be good to my son.

198
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:57,960
Son?

199
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,720
She's Naoto's mother.

200
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,320
What a small town.

201
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:08,130
Is he working hard? Isn't
he playing baseball all day?

202
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:11,850
Your son's not alone.
I'm totally disgusted!

203
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,360
Shall I fry some fish?

204
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,930
No, thank you very much.

205
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,510
I have some fine fish today.

206
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,880
Mackerel sashimi...

207
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,740
Mackerel?

208
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:30,580
No! No!  Anyway, we can't.

209
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,590
Please enjoy.

210
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,530
I have sake.

211
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,830
I've made my decision
on the baseball team.

212
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:42,970
It's being dissolved.

213
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:46,860
That would be unwise.
Baseball is all they've got.

214
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,130
It's like their lover.
I feel sorry for them.

215
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:54,350
Please reconsider
it, for their sake.

216
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:57,690
You like it, too...

217
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,000
I love it.

218
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,070
Think of it as a
lost love, and give it up.

219
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:06,070
Aren't you concerned
about the personnel

220
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,970
arrangement? That's
higher priority.

221
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,420
That's true, but...

222
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:14,510
Losing baseball is
a bigger problem...

223
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,740
I'm restructuring in
the next few days!

224
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:22,630
Please have another drink.
May we have more beer?

225
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:27,060
I'm serious.
I'm doing it.

226
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:31,070
You're so stiff.

227
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,970
Let's sing a song.

228
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,040
How about a duet?

229
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,340
I've just decided
on the first lay off.

230
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,110
Who is it?

231
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:51,110
A karaoke freak with
a disgusting smile.

232
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,060
Me?

233
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:59,620
Cut out that weird,
disgusting laughter!

234
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,260
What's the status on
the baseball team?

235
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,280
No problem.

236
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,730
Complete breakdown
of negotiations!

237
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,040
You have no right
to say anything about

238
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:13,030
the baseball team.

239
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,710
Don't speak like that to her.

240
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,140
Be quiet, you old hag.

241
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,650
How dare you
speak to me like that!

242
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:23,510
You call yourself a mother?

243
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,450
You only know how to
waggle in front of men!

244
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,080
Why did you do that?

245
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,990
Stop nagging!

246
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:36,810
Say something.
Your woman's crying.

247
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,600
Stop it!

248
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,820
Stop beating him!

249
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,040
That's enough!

250
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,790
Everyone's so selfish.

251
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,680
You're cruel!

252
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,980
Why did you do that?

253
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,520
Fool!

254
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:16,110
That's a normal
occurrence at his place.

255
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:23,730
When he was young, his
father was heavily

256
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,260
in debt and disappeared.

257
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:31,930
Since then a lot of different
men started to hang around.

258
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:37,860
His mom gives money
 to men and gets dumped.

259
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,310
The shop is
deep in debt.

260
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,910
Naoto's repaying the
debts with his salary.

261
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:51,820
Oh, I'm so sad. I don't
want to hear his story.

262
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,680
I'm only here to work.

263
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,650
I don't care about
his family situation.

264
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,610
That's true, but...

265
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,960
I'm not interested.
It's so boorish.

266
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,500
I agree.

267
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,850
It's Sunday and you're
reading a comic?

268
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,500
There's no baseball
practice and l don't

269
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:34,890
have any friends.

270
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,330
Go out with the manager.

271
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,320
He's probably
bored at home.

272
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,610
Forget about him.

273
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,020
You can't be picky here.

274
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,440
Play with me, then.

275
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,530
I'm very picky.

276
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,950
What's with you?

277
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:01,070
I heard you fought
with your mom again.

278
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,480
The manager was hoping
you wouldn't get violent.

279
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:08,490
He's seriously
worried about you.

280
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:12,510
Stop mentioning
the manager.

281
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,940
Is someone
going to be fired?

282
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,040
If we lose someone,
we can't play baseball.

283
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:52,370
What a silly look.

284
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,160
Welcome.

285
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,530
Reservations
under Iwase.

286
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:15,010
I've been waiting for you.
Please come this way.

287
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,600
Your guest has arrived.

288
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,040
Please enjoy.

289
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,170
What a nice restaurant.

290
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,520
This place is recently
very popular.

291
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,710
Didn't you know?

292
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:41,050
I haven't been reading
any magazines lately.

293
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,770
Do you like it?

294
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,530
There's no karaoke...

295
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,170
What would you like
to drink?

296
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,210
I'll have the same.

297
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,960
I feel at ease.

298
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:04,050
The Australian beef is
really having a rough time.

299
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,080
Don't you know?

300
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,540
What happened?

301
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,020
Seiyo Shoji began
a monopoly and

302
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:16,550
adjusted the market price.
I think the price will rise.

303
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,080
That was your specialty.

304
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,720
What was our
food division doing?

305
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,750
Manager Nagamine
is changing positions,

306
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,610
so they're  busy with
the replacement candidates.

307
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,190
It'll either be Mr. Nakano
from Osaka or Mr. Ichmura

308
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:33,480
from the textiles division.

309
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:36,520
I see.

310
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,690
Aren't you getting
any information?

311
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,040
The main office is
making their move.

312
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,700
I'm living in the
country, so...

313
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,660
This is the menu...

314
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,520
I'll have...

315
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,750
I understand.

316
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:03,970
How about you?

317
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:05,950
I'll have the same.

318
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,640
Don't pity me.

319
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:19,280
I haven't given up, yet.
I'm going to do it!

320
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,940
I don't want other people
manipulating my destiny.

321
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:29,580
What is it?

322
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:35,600
I was offered a position...
in the audit office.

323
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:37,330
It's very close to the
 Board of Directors.

324
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,780
Really?

325
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:43,860
I may have to
liquidate your factory.

326
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,780
Are you joining
hands with Nagamine?

327
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,300
No, with advancement.

328
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:54,660
Thank you for waiting.
Please take your napkin.

329
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,530
Competition at work doesn't
affect our relationship.

330
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:03,470
I know that, but...right now,
I can't be calm.

331
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,630
Remain calm.

332
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,950
Don't act like an average
woman would.

333
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,940
Why can't I?

334
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,990
What shall I do?

335
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:26,460
I'll eat it.

336
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,130
Nice pitch.

337
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,730
It has a lot of spirit.

338
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,580
Nice pitch.

339
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,460
Should we be
playing baseball?

340
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,060
Be quiet! We'll get
out of shape.

341
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,210
One more!

342
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:19,080
What happened
to the restructuring?

343
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:22,720
She hasn't said anything.
I guess it's not happening.

344
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,760
I gave it to her straight.

345
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:30,140
Did you really?
I'm worried.

346
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:36,940
When the machines
stop at 5 p.m.,

347
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,640
We're having a meeting
Everyone must gather.

348
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,070
This is it.

349
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:45,340
It's a showdown. So what
if there's a restructuring.

350
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:47,950
Let's fight.
We'll show her!

351
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,030
Who is that?

352
00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:00,520
Oh, no! She's here.

353
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:20,030
Is everyone here?

354
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,400
Nobu will be
here soon.

355
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,140
A girl came to see him
from Tokyo, and they're

356
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,500
fighting outside.

357
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,890
Be quiet!

358
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:41,550
The reason for this meeting
is to have you understand

359
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:47,170
the situation of this factory,
and to discuss a strategy.

360
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:50,570
This indicates the amount
of sales necessary to

361
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,860
increase the
company's profit.

362
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:55,080
The horizontal line indicates
sales and the vertical line

363
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,550
indicates expenses.

364
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,000
Fixed expenses such
as salaries and

365
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:02,660
depreciation amounts
to approximately

366
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,790
three million yen per month.

367
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:06,730
The variations in
the expenses

368
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,480
for material
processing is this.

369
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:12,470
The point where the two
lines meet is the turning point

370
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:17,450
from a deficit. In other
words this factory

371
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:22,090
must have 7.5 million yen
in sales to earn profits.

372
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,640
What a bind.
What are you doing?

373
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,600
Is this a quiz?

374
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,860
Be quiet and sit down!

375
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,960
And so...?

376
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:40,850
Mr. Omori, what is
the monthly sales?

377
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:43,580
Nowhere near 7.5 million yen.

378
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:47,450
This factory goes into
further deficit every month.

379
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:52,420
It's not possible to increase
sales in such a short time.

380
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:54,640
Let's look at a different
idea. Let's try reducing the

381
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,040
fixed expenses.

382
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:05,130
Thus sales will be
5 million yen and no deficit.

383
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,240
So...

384
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,960
Reduce salary expense.

385
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,060
It means the
reduction of personnel.

386
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,200
Wait one minute!

387
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:20,420
You said let's all
think of a strategy.

388
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:24,740
Yet you've already fired
one of us. That's not fair.

389
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:28,120
Be responsible for
what you've said.

390
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,070
We're not fools.

391
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,620
Then show me
another strategy!

392
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,970
Come on...

393
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,420
Manager, give it to her...

394
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:51,020
Isn't there another
reason for the deficit?

395
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,090
If there is, show it to me.

396
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:59,090
The efficiency of the
non-professionals is poor.

397
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,580
Let's do our best tomorrow.

398
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:08,520
Let's make a pledge in
front of the factory chief...

399
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,300
How about that?

400
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,490
Idealism in not logical.

401
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:16,460
Our efficiency level is
poor because we can't

402
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,160
play baseball.

403
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,530
Leave that on
the side for now.

404
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,980
Why! It's important.

405
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:25,550
The fate of the team hasn't
been clearly explained.

406
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,230
How many people do
you need for baseball?

407
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:28,930
Nine.

408
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:32,850
If there are 8 people, it'll
inevitably be dissolved.

409
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:38,960
Is someone being laid off?

410
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:42,460
Based on the data the
earnings per employee

411
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:46,450
is too low. That's due to
the fact that we employ

412
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:54,240
unnecessary people.
Let's verify the necessity

413
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:57,900
of each employee.

414
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,660
Seitoro Mikumi

415
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:08,900
Your title is Quality
Control Manager.

416
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:15,260
Only I can determine
the quality of of the mackerel.

417
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:17,350
It's nothing to be proud of.

418
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,440
You're qualified. Is there
anyone else

419
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,250
with that qualification?

420
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:31,370
You're essential to the
factory. It can't be helped.

421
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,000
It can't be helped.

422
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,650
Genyo Omori

423
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,920
Accounting Manager.

424
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:43,920
Fire me and you
can take over.

425
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,650
Is there anyone capable
of bookkeeping?

426
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:47,900
No, they're all
awful at math.

427
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,800
Then, it can't be helped.
You must remain.

428
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,730
Mochizuki Shijimi

429
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,770
You're the Assistant
Factory Chief.

430
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,870
What are your
job specifications?

431
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:07,250
I'm your subordinate.

432
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,920
I have no need
for a subordinate...

433
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,100
Oh, my...I guess
I'm going to be fired.

434
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:19,050
Why are you
Assistant Factory Chief?

435
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:23,400
The past factory
chief decided it.

436
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,030
It's the main
office's request.

437
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:29,070
Your company
made that decision.

438
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:32,500
Shijimi's father is
the head fisherman.

439
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:37,350
You're the daughter
of an influential man.

440
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,900
Your company likes
that kind of human affairs.

441
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:44,920
What are your merits
as Assistant Factory Chief?

442
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,480
There aren't many...

443
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,760
What about the
demerits for your dismissal?

444
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:56,420
Terrible! Her father
won't bring the fish.

445
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,720
He favors our
factory during droughts.

446
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,340
She's the only
woman at the factory.

447
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:04,330
The factory will
lose sex appeal.

448
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:06,420
In Tokyo, that statement
would be the cause for a sexual

449
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,640
harassment suit.

450
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,420
What is it?

451
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:14,840
I have business to take
care of. May I go home?

452
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:16,360
The meeting
hasn't finished.

453
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,920
What is it?

454
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,050
I'm going to see my wife.

455
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:25,160
His wife is in the
hospital, for many years.

456
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:27,260
I go to see her everyday.
I'm sorry, but I'm leaving.

457
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:29,510
Which is more important?

458
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,850
My wife.

459
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:38,760
Please stay to the end.
I want to talk to you.

460
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,010
Marketing...

461
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:49,200
I do sales and buying.

462
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,280
Your sales record?

463
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,160
The main office determines
export destinations.

464
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,640
Other than that, the
town's grocers.

465
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,930
Don't you make sales
calls on other stores?

466
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,170
Should I?

467
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,030
Sales is just a title.

468
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,010
That's not true!

469
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,510
Mr. Tsuruki can do sales.

470
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:10,660
However...Mr. Shioya has
been doing it all this time.

471
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,780
Reorganization begins
with the breaking of tradition

472
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,810
and customs.

473
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:17,310
Firing him might be difficult.

474
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,320
Why?

475
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,020
His wife's hospitalization
expenses are high.

476
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,500
Private matters are 
none of my business.

477
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:28,960
His wife is ill. We have
to sympathize.

478
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:32,440
We'll relieve Mr. Tsurugi's
position to Mr. Shioya.

479
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,090
I can do that.

480
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,670
You traitor.

481
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:40,660
Firing Tsurugi
will be difficult.

482
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:44,060
Tell her how
important I am.

483
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:46,970
Tsurugi must organize
the obon festival.

484
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:50,140
Only I can do it.

485
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,930
Just cancel the festival.

486
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:57,960
We can't do that! The
town looks toward to it.

487
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:00,560
If we cancel it,
a riot will occur!

488
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,590
As everything has
been settled,I'm leaving.

489
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:27,180
Only I can service
the binding machine.

490
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:30,190
It won't work unless I kick it.

491
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,920
Anyone will do.

492
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,800
Mysteriously, it
has to be Nobu.

493
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,490
If the mark is even
1 mm off, it won't work.

494
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:40,800
When I kicked it, it moved.

495
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,130
That was a coincidence.
Don't meddle, you dunce!

496
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,900
Just get it serviced.

497
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,460
The manufacturer went
bankrupt 10 years ago.

498
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:51,320
Buy a new one.

499
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:53,180
If we had the
money, we would.

500
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:57,020
Any complaints? I'm the
most necessary person.

501
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:06,040
You're still here?
Don't cry...

502
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,870
I'm leaving.

503
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,050
Why are you working here?

504
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:35,160
He's from Thailand
to do research study.

505
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:37,610
Thailand.

506
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,380
It was the main
office's request.

507
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,170
Are you here because
of the new factory

508
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:49,570
in Thailand?

509
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,900
You'll be going home soon.

510
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,060
I won't let you leave.

511
00:35:56,580 --> 00:36:00,930
What's the matter?

512
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,480
Nothing.

513
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,280
Ishii Takeshi

514
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:16,430
Operation Control.
What do you do?

515
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,930
I take care of the
part-time old ladies.

516
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:24,010
Is that all?

517
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,410
Yes.

518
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:29,460
Is that necessary
to the factory?

519
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:35,380
I keep them company
during breaks.

520
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:40,580
He's the only one
that does that.

521
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,780
They like me, too.

522
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,820
They like me the best.

523
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,590
Ms. Takahashi
said I'm cute.

524
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:51,630
She gives me
rice crackers...

525
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:58,060
If Takeshi is fired, there
won't be any part-timers.

526
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:07,110
Maruyama Saburo, you
manage the warehouse.

527
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,230
What do you do?

528
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:14,080
I stand in front of
the warehouse.

529
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,680
All day long?

530
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:18,110
That's my job.

531
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:20,510
Why do you have
to stand there?

532
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,910
Dogs go in sometimes.

533
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:25,410
The lock is broken.

534
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:28,090
Buy a new one! It's not as
expensive as a machine!

535
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:30,950
A key is more than
adequate.

536
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:32,600
Please don't fire him.

537
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,220
Why?

538
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:37,340
He's memorized the
whole radio exercises.

539
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,870
You memorize it!

540
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:42,480
He's been with us
for 30 years.

541
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,220
So?

542
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:45,350
Haven't you heard of
the seniority system?

543
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,400
What a warm phrase.

544
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,350
That's an obsolete word.

545
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:53,340
I judge by performance.

546
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,220
That's a cold word.

547
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:57,560
This is for the sake of
the company's profits.

548
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,280
Sentimentality and
business are separate.

549
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:07,080
Please...Mr. Maruyama
has 3 little children.

550
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:13,730
Who can't operate
a machine...

551
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:17,080
isn't the child of an
influential man...doesn't have

552
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,400
an ill wife...isn't particularly
loved by the part-time

553
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,980
old ladies...and doesn't fall
under the seniority system!

554
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:41,400
You're an Operations
Manager, too.

555
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,030
What do you do?

556
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:45,840
I turn an the main
power switch.

557
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:48,850
Anyone can do that. You
don't have to kick it, right?

558
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:52,510
There's no need
for 2 people.

559
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:54,060
I guess.

560
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,840
Do you have any
qualifications?

561
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,070
None.

562
00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:02,430
The factory doesn't
need you.

563
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:06,610
You shouldn't fire him.

564
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,490
And why not!

565
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,660
The situation with
his mother...

566
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:12,600
That's irrelevant!

567
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:18,110
He works and pays
off her debts.

568
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:23,820
That's enough...

569
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:30,060
I compromised with the
others but the debts

570
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,690
are his mother's problem!
Why does the company

571
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:35,600
have to support a woman
who gives money to men!

572
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:40,580
All right! I quit.

573
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:47,300
Mr. Hayakawa, you should
settle your disorderly

574
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,830
personal life before
working at a company.

575
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:55,310
How dare you say that.

576
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:58,780
The company will not
be responsible for

577
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:00,500
people with personal
problems.

578
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,750
I don't care what
you say about work,

579
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,580
but I will not forgive you
for insulting a colleague.

580
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,590
Apologize.

581
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:39,510
Apologize for hitting me.

582
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,040
You're the one who
has to apologize.

583
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:52,190
We're not machine parts,
we're human beings.

584
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:58,940
You're not human. You're
lower than a mackerel.

585
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,410
Are you doing that
until morning?

586
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:44,120
I can't go home. The
factory chief lives there.

587
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,630
I'm going home.

588
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:57,520
I think you should
apologize.

589
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:02,340
It's not good to hit
a woman.

590
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:05,020
Don't lecture me.

591
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,490
That's right.

592
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:16,230
Naoto, take care of your mother.
She's all you've got.

593
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:19,090
Butt out.

594
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:32,080
Was that the first time
you hit a woman?

595
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:35,220
Let's put that to rest.

596
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:40,690
I've never been
hit by a man.

597
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:45,580
If I were, I may fall in love with him.

598
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,810
