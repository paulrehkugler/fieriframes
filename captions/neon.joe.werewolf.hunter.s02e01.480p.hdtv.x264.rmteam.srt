00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,390
My name is Neon Joe.

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,860
I dedicate my whole life
to hunting werewolf in the hope

4
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,490
that one of these time
it turn out to be my daddy.

5
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:11,390
Hello, son.
You know what these are?

6
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,400
The severed heads
of all the werewolf I kill!

7
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:18,070
This here right here
gonna go right here.

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,240
You chew the math.

9
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,640
Aah!

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,840
So what are you gonna do now?

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,980
Suppose it's time

12
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,910
to start following my dreams.

13
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,050
As for hunting werewolf,
I'm officially retired.

14
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,570
Hey, Joe, looks like

15
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,400
the margarita volcano
needs a new batch.

16
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,300
Oh, yeah?
He-yump.

17
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,040
I made one this morning.

18
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,270
Added a little extra 'rita.

19
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,640
Gonna call it
the more-garita.

20
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,710
- Get it?
- No, I tell you what to do.

21
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:05,910
Moon is alive.

22
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,980
Yeah, we hear you.
Moon is alive.

23
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,980
Okay, Uri, it's closing time.

24
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,750
She doesn't understand.

25
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:12,920
You don't understand.

26
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,720
Mm-hmm.
The moon is alive.

27
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,220
We got it.
Closing time.

28
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,890
Good night, Uri.

29
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:21,730
Man, oh, man, that
one drunk Russki, huh, Cleve?

30
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,500
It's last call, ma'am.

31
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,930
That's, uh, Neon Joe,
Werewolf Hunter, right?

32
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:30,410
Yeah, but he doesn't really
go by that name anymore.

33
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,810
<i>That's</i> who he is now.

34
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,240
Neon Joe,
regular everyday duck hunter.

35
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,740
Start off as more of a gimmick

36
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,950
to draw customers,
but it didn't really work,

37
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:42,020
and so that's when we thought of
the margarita volcano,

38
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,690
but that didn't really
work, either.

39
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,250
So we're looking
for a new gimmick.

40
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,220
So you're his sidekick.

41
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,020
Yeah, I guess I am his sidekick.

42
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,760
That's hot.

43
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,390
I'm into number twos,

44
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,260
if you know what I mean.

45
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,800
Can I get a selfie?
No.

46
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:58,870
Joe doesn't like selfies.

47
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,700
No.

48
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,400
With you.

49
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,740
Oh, okay.

Hey.

51
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,280
Hmm. Thanks.

52
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,510
See you around.
Okay.

53
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,080
See you later.

That girl was so into <i>you</i>

that she wanted to take
a selfie with <i>me.</i>

What? No.

I don't know if I'm going
back to the bar

363
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:07,690
because Plaid Jeff
offered me a job

364
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,370
as his personal assistant.

365
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,700
I'm sorry, Joe.

It's all right, Cleve.
You a good friend.

367
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,370
You want to take that job,
it'll be no hard feeling.

00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:21,880
But if I ever take my rage
on Plaid Jeff face,

that his blood gonna be
on your hands.

Ooh.

371
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,050
Now go get me some Band-Aids
and Neosporin.

372
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,850
I got cut right across the tip.

Yes, sir.

374
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,660
You ever had a Band-Aid
on your dick?

375
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,430
I don't see how the thing
gonna stay on.

376
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,430
Get me some duct tape, too!

It fun.

You got to come by one night
and bring Linda.

396

How's she doing, by the way?

is retired
werewolf hunter Neon Joe,
