2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,150
Where you heading, cowboy?

3
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,090
Vance Dontay's mansion.

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,990
He's your ex-wife!

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,890
Werewolf heart.

6
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,630
- You're into Neon Joe.
- You saw this, right?

7
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,900
Finally the world
will see Yuri isn't crazy

8
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,100
and that moon is alive!

9
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,800
Do we call Daggart?

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,570
You already did.

11
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,630
NASA has just confirmed
that the moon is, in fact,

12
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,500
moving closer to Earth,
causing mild panic.

13
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,870
Meanwhile, the proximity
of the moon

14
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,110
has led to an increase
in sick waves

15
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:03,240
and has surfers all over
the world out in droves.

16
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,280
In other news, a mysterious
rash of Greggar Sonoir robberies

17
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,950
has law enforcement
on high alert.

18
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,620
Yeah, this chair nice.

19
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,390
I should have been
sitting in this one

20
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,020
when you told me
about your 'giney.

21
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,830
I wasn't sure at first,
'cause, you know,

22
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,590
I didn't want to make
the association

23
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:23,030
and the connection
between vagina and leather.

24
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,830
Remember that song in "Grease"?

25
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,530
The thing about things
going together,

26
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,470
"shama lama ding dong"
or whatever they say?

27
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,410
'Cause, you know,
vagina and leather...

28
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,240
they shama lama ding
don't go together,

29
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,733
- in my mind, at least.
- You know, any time

30
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,480
you'd want to help,
that... that'd be great.

31
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,410
I'm not the one who lost
the werewolf heart,

32
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,420
so you on your own, Jack.

33
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,020
That is a nice attitude
from somebody

34
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,090
who could never seem
to remember my birthday.

35
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,250
Oh, give me a break!
That happened once.

36
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:47,820
Didn't lose it.
It's here.

37
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,290
I just don't know where it is.

38
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,090
Yeah, that sound
like losing to me.

39
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,390
Seems to me like
someone stole it.

40
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:59,130
Colonel Nathaniel Daggart,
U.S. military.

41
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:00,540
We got a lot of
catching up to do.

42
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,170
Why don't you start off
by telling me

43
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,410
where I can find of pair
of them sweet-ass shades?

44
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,180
Military issue.
Not for sale.

45
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:11,610
Check them out, though.

46
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,410
Oh, yeah!

47
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:17,290
These are real nice.
Thanks for the sampling.

48
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,020
Keep them.

49
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,030
No, thanks. I'm good.

50
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,560
Don't want to owe
the U.S. military nothing.

51
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:35,040
The days of catching rays
may be gone forever...

52
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,910
if the moon has anything
to say about it.

53
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,270
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up.

54
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,640
Let me just play audience
surrogate for a moment

55
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,110
and ask what you mean.

56
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:46,550
The moon is alive
and headed straight for Earth.

57
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,250
Have you ever heard
of the Celestial Seduction?

58
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,650
No, but sounds sexy.

59
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,220
My loins getting all hot
just thinking about it.

60
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,060
When the hearts of
40 werewolves come together,

61
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,060
they form
an all-powerful cube,

62
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,130
and that cube will send off
the most concentrated pheromones

63
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,530
known to man,

64
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,470
more powerful
than a thousand suns,

65
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,130
summoning the moon
towards Earth.

66
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,940
It will create
a race of powerful,

67
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:11,210
super-violent,
hyper-sexual werewolves.

68
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,280
Mankind will be wiped out.

69
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,980
Military radar picked up
a massive energy source

70
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,820
emanating from your old bar.

71
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,490
We believe it's the cube.

72
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:29,090
Yuri.

73
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:33,630
I get that 40 werewolf hearts
form this all-powerful cube,

74
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,530
but why are you
spraying it with cologne?

75
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,300
I'm preparing cube
for Celestial Seduction.

76
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,770
Celestial Seduction?

77
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,140
That's right.

78
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,770
Moon is alive like
I've been saying all along.

79
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:51,080
You see, Yuri is not
so crazy after all, eh?

80
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,750
I went to moon.

81
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,980
I love moon.

82
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,950
Moon love me.

83
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,720
We will finally be together,

84
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,560
and I will get
to have sex with moon!

85
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,090
Oh! Ha ha!

86
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,330
Whoo whoo!

87
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,730
I'm coming!
Oh!

88
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:11,500
Hey.

89
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,070
Do you to get out of here?
Go role play?

90
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,940
You can be Yuri,
and I'll be the moon.

91
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:21,340
Uh, why would you want to do
that without Neon Joe?

92
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,540
I don't know how he knew
you had a werewolf heart

93
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,310
or how he even
managed to steal it,

94
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,620
but I'll never put anything
past them sneaky Russkies.

95
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,350
The only thing that can
prevent this from happening

96
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:34,090
is the world's greatest
werewolf hunting force.

97
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,260
No problem, sir.

98
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,530
Plaid Jeff at your service.

99
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,000
I was talking about them.

100
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,970
Us?

101
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,540
We're not together anymore.

102
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,070
He's out of the business.

103
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:52,340
I'm the new hot shit,
number-1 werewolf hunter now.

104
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,780
When you two were in love

105
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,080
and at the peak of your werewolf
hunting abilities,

106
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,480
you were unstoppable.

107
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,250
And if this chicken shit
hadn't run away,

108
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,720
we'd be a step
closer to retirement

109
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,450
and living in Maui
like we'd planned.

110
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:03,720
I did not run away.

111
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,590
We had a deal
that we agreed upon

112
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,320
that I had to run away if it...

113
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,560
It don't even matter.

114
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,260
I don't want to be
with you no how.

115
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,460
I don't buy that.
When I look at the two of you,

116
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,400
I see a couple that
still loves each other,

117
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,630
just forgot how to communicate.

118
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,000
What are you,

119
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,740
some kind of military-trained
couples counselor

120
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,000
sent here to rekindle
our relationship

121
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,510
so we can save mankind?

122
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,280
That's exactly what I am.

123
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,080
I studied with Dr. Phil
during the first Gulf War

124
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,310
and completed my work

125
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,250
on interpersonal relationship
dynamics

126
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,580
during the Arab Spring

127
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,490
in Operation
How to Be a Better Listener.

128
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,950
Right now, we have 12 hours

129
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,390
to cram in 12 years
of couples counseling.

130
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,360
We have the entire military
at our disposal

131
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,160
to make this work.

132
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,060
Wait.
Hold on a second.

133
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,070
What about me?

134
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,870
Me and Vance, we make
a pretty good team.

135
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,370
Don't we, babe?

136
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,780
We spent months together!

137
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,310
I even faked my death
to be with you,

138
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,480
and that's proof that
we're a solid couple.

139
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,320
Shh!

140
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,880
I love you, Jeff,
but there's no us

141
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,220
unless I fall madly back in love
with my soul mate.

142
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,760
You know that.

143
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:21,460
Just walk away, friend.

144
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,030
Just walk away.

145
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,630
Vance, talk to me, babe.
What...

146
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,200
As a trained professional,

147
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,370
I must weigh in
and also say to you,

148
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:33,740
just walk away, friend.

149
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,340
Just walk away.

150
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,010
Fine.

151
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,820
I'll leave.

152
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,020
Yeah.

153
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,360
You know what?

154
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:52,690
I'll probably just defeat
that cube my damn self.

155
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:56,730
And we'll see who'll
end up with the girl.

156
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:01,170
And another thing...
I'm not walking away.

157
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,440
I'm walking towards.

158
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,610
Look like you walking
away to me, friend.

159
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,550
I'm walking towards!

160
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,550
All right, now, look,
even if we was able

161
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,450
to somehow fall back in love,

162
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,780
which I'll tell you right now
is not gonna happen,

163
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,990
how we gonna defeat this cube?

164
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,860
Turgolock.

165
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,830
Who?

166
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,100
The crazy tides
have brought surfers

167
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,700
from all over the world,

168
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,070
all ready to aid
in the seduction

169
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,040
of our mother moon.

170
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,270
What are you watching?

171
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,610
The Will Smith movie
"Hitch."

172
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,610
Good American
seduction propaganda.

173
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,350
I must explore every avenue

174
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,220
and be ready
for moon's every whim.

175
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,920
Yeah.

176
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,590
Great!
Put it in the corner, please.

177
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,750
Aah!

178
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,160
You're working
with the werewolves?

179
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:04,230
Soon there will be a race
of super powerful werewolves.

180
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,500
I'd be fool not
to work with them.

181
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,100
Oh, that's smart, Yuri.
That's a good idea.

182
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,010
Mm-hmm.

183
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,740
Ashley, will you help me
get some more cologne?

184
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,910
Yep.

185
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,780
Neon Joe would
never approve of this.

186
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,380
I have got to do something.

187
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,920
Like what?

188
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:30,290
Your old rings.
Put them on.

189
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,860
It'll help establish
the mind-set

190
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,330
that you're a couple again.

191
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,060
Now this is
a compliment grenade.

192
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,130
You have 30 seconds
to compliment the other person.

193
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:42,240
Otherwise it'll explode.
Go!

194
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,540

Seriously?

197
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,750
What? It was sincere.

198
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,550
I agree.
Not great, but it counts.

199

- what you're doing down there.
- Come on, you two.

202
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,960

Are you calling my dick dumb?

206
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,430
Joe, you need to learn
to be sensitive

207

Thick and veiny... yeah.

212
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:21,740
On your first date,
you saw Neil Diamond in concert

213
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,780
and later that night
watched "E.T."

214
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,580
Recreating that evening
might elicit

215
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,850
deep-rooted feelings
in sense memory. Go!

216

A lot of people didn't.

295

324
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:59,080
Do a little chip-chop with this
thing on some little pee-pee.

325
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,880
Oh, the sword
is of no use to<i> you.</i>

326
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,450
The power of love made you two

327
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:12,090
the greatest werewolf hunting
duo in the world.

328
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:15,900
You fell out of love
a long time ago

329
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:18,470
and tried to rekindle the flame,

330
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,670
but it didn't work,
and you both know it.

331
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:25,570
I'd fight the cube myself,

332
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:32,180
but I'm afraid I no longer
possess the strength.

333
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:34,080
Sorry to hear.

334
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,580
What you doing, Daggart?

335
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,750
Using you two to get
to this old bag of bones

336
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,950
and to that sword.

337
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:44,220
Thanks for the weapon, Lagoturd.

338
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,560
That's Turgolock,
Dag-asswipe.

339
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,900
Oh!

340
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,560
Nice burn, old man.

341
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,630
Daggart, don't do it.

342
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:57,300
You sure got balls
for a guy without any.

343
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,250
Ah, he-yump!

344
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,820
This better be another one

345
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,620
of your trust-building
exercises.

346
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,583
I'm afraid I haven't been
entirely honest with you.

347
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:18,190
What, you ain't the military's
top couple counselor?

348
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,190
No, I am.
And as you know,

349
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,230
the military's been
studying werewolves for years.

350
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,630
We devised a theory that

351
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:27,100
if werewolves had better
interpersonal relationships,

352
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:30,270
they might be less
of a threat to humans.

353
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:32,710
I felt the only way
to understand them

354
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,970
was to think like them.

355
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:35,710
And to think like them,

356
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:39,250
I had to become one of them.

357
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,520
And I realized that counseling
wasn't the problem.

358
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,850
Relationships were.

359
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:46,590
We don't need another person.

360
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,020
We only need ourselves.

361
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:52,130
Imagine a world
without relationships,

362
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,530
without bickering,
without arguments.

363
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,870
You sound like a man
whose heart's been broken.

364
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,800
You leave Barbara out of this!

365
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,240
What?
Who's Barbara?

366
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,140
How do you know about Barbara?

367
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,670
Did she ask about me?

368
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,810
Who the hell is Barbara?

369
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,410
I don't know who Barbara is.

370
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,980
Daggart, you sound
like you talking

371
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,840
about creating a world
of lone wolves.

372
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,210
Lone super-wolves
who can transform on their own,

373
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,480
free of the moon.

374
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,430
And now that I have a sword
of a million wolves,

375
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:35,800
I'll be running the show
from now on.

376
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,370
Good day, everyone.

377
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,880
Whoa, that was cool.

378
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,410
Wow!

379
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,020
Everything looking good.

380
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:51,020
Moon tracking our location.

381
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:53,820
Wait!
What is happening?

382
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,020
Moon changing its course.

383
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,290
Hey, man, there's another cube

384
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,590
running around out there, man.

385
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:00,790
What?

386
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,330
Where Cleve?

387
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:10,640
Umm, uh, he went to get
some more cologne.

388
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,440
I'll bet he did.

389
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:20,880
Can't believe Turgolock dead.

390
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,790
He's supposed to be
all-knowing and invincible.

391
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,890
First time I met him he had
a burrito waiting for me.

392
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:32,590
Knew exactly how I like it...
chorizo and rice,

393
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:36,430
refried bean,
sour cream on the side,

394
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:40,630
little salsa verde,
pico de gallo,

395
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:42,240
chips and guac,

396
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:45,640
watermelon aguas frescas
with just a little bit of ice.

397
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:48,140
He even knew that I liked
a flour tortilla

398
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,740
rather than corn.

399
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,220
How could he not
see Daggart coming?

400
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,720
What? Why you looking
at me like that?

401
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,190
You saved my life.

402
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:08,700
That's all I needed.

403
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:09,930
All you needed for what?

404
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:11,700
For this.

405
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,370
Ooh, he-yump!

406
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,210
He-yump!

407
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,640
Ooh he-yump!

408
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:25,210
Now there's the true passion
we've been waiting for.

409
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,750
Turgolock, you alive!

410
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:32,220
This needed to happen for you
two to fall back in love,

411
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,390
but now you must hurry.

412
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,960
The prophecy says

413
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:39,330
if a werewolf eats
the cube's nuts,

414
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,060
he will gain its power
and rule the world.

415
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,630
Here, take my car keys.

416
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,970
Cool keychain.

417
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:57,480
Turgolock, no!

418
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,210
Oh!

419
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,980
Oh, babe, can you
ever forgive me

420
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,520
for what I done to you

421
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:07,850
even though I did done
what we agreed to do,

422
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:13,290
which is why I done gone did do
what I did to get done?

423
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,460
Do the world
still have a chance?

424
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,500
Oh, it's on.

425
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,740
Yeah.

426
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:25,310
Why don't you guys
just screw already?

427
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,010
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

428
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,280
Look at me!

429
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:32,350
I look hot, don't I, moon?

430
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,720
Hey, moon!
Yoo-hoo!

431
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,950
Cleve!

432
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,620
Ha ha ha.

433
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:40,450
Keep running, Cleve!
Save the world!

434
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:43,760
If I can't be with you,
I don't want to live anyway.

435
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,440
I'm sorry.

436
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,700
I just can't take the chance

437
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:02,210
of them hurting
my boss's girlfriend.

438
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,380
You dim, spineless
suck-up.

439
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,750
That's so hot.

440
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,650
Man, for such a old geezer,

441
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:15,390
Turgolock sure
got one boss ride.

442
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,960
Oh, babe, when it's
all said and done,

443
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,560
I'm gonna make it up to you.

444
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,190
Maybe we'll go to New York City

445
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,730
for that big spa weekend
I always promised.

446
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,670
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

447
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,870
I don't care that
you look like a man.

448
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,540
You still got a 'giney,

449
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:32,440
and I speak 'ginese.

450
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,140
You think you can finally say

451
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,580
that we did not have
an agreement

452
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:38,350
that one of us would run away?

453
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,450
Say what now?

454
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,210
Do you really not remember

455
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,380
me vehemently
disagreeing to that?

456
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,580
Do I he-yump?

457
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,350
Will you at least acknowledge

458
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,120
that I did not agree
to that idea?

459
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,490
Will I he-yump?

460
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:52,030
Up yours, Joe.

461
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,660
Oh, baby, you know
what I he-yump!
