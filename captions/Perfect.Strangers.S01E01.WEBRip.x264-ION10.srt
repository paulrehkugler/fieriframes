I hope whoever it is
brought a chainsaw.

24
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:24,212
Am I looking up
"Larry Appleton?"

25
00:02:24,278 --> 00:02:26,447
Larry Appleton. That's me.

26
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:29,917
Larry, Larry, Larry.

27
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,552
I look everywhere for you.

28
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:34,388
I walk the streets.
I search the alleys.

29
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:36,990
I say to everyone,
"Have you seen Larry?"

30
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:40,794
You don't know how many people
have never heard of you.

31
00:02:46,534 --> 00:02:50,103
Yes, yes. Now you're safe.

32
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,172
Who are you?

33
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,308
I'm Balki Bartokomous.

34
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,644
Philo, my fifth cousin
three times removed

35
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,480
is a step-uncle to your father
on my mother's side

36
00:02:59,547 --> 00:03:00,848
two continents removed.

37
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:03,917
I see. So we're
sort of related by rumor.

38
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:10,358
America.

39
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:12,860
Land of my dreams.

40
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,928
Home of the Whopper.

41
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,666
So cousin Philo
says to me, he says

42
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:20,901
"Balki, when you
move to America"

43
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:24,071
"you have to go
to Madison, Wisconsin"

44
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:26,073
"to look up
George Appleton."

45
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:30,444
That's your father.
That's the story I heard too.

46
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:32,713
So, I said goodbye to...Mypos

47
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,648
my little Mediterranean
island country.

48
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:38,386
And I got on the tramp steamer.
Tramp, tramp, tramp.

49
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:41,522
And then I got on the bus.
Bus, bus, bus.

50
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:44,592
And I found your father
to move in but he said, "No."

51
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:48,662
"You have to go to the big city
of Chicago to find my son."

52
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,664
That's you.

53
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:54,067
So I got on the bus.
Bus, bus, bus.

54
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:55,803
And here I am.

55
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:59,039
Well, wait a minute, you came
here to move in with me?

56
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:05,813
Of course I did.

57
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:10,918
Well, Balki, uh, look,
there, there is a problem.

58
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:15,689
See, I just moved here myself.

59
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,691
This is the first time
I've lived alone.

60
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:21,562
I actually have my own
bachelor pad. You want a beer?

61
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:26,434
No, thank you.
What are you saying?

62
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,836
Well, I'm saying...

63
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:30,704
You see,
I've lived my whole life

64
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:35,509
with eight brothers
and sisters, and it's time...

65
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:39,012
See, I want to live alone.

66
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:42,149
I didn't even know
you were coming.

67
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:43,817
Your father didn't call you?

68
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:47,788
Well, I'm sure he tried
and I just wasn't home.

69
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:48,922
Oh.

70
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:55,929
Well...I feel like a fool
to come here and bother you.

71
00:04:57,431 --> 00:05:00,133
Goodbye, American cousin.
Nice to meet you.

72
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,903
Don't worry about me.
I know where I'm going.

73
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,806
Where are you going?
I don't know.

74
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,811
But this is America.
Open all night.

75
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,618
Uh, look, I can't just
turn you out into the cold.

76
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,822
You can stay--
Oh, thank you, thank you.

77
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:24,658
No, no, no.

78
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:26,594
That many thank yous
would be appropriate

79
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,562
if you were staying
a long time.

80
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:31,965
A day or two worth
of thank yous is plenty.

81
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:34,468
Thank you.

82
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:37,871
Look, you can stay a couple
of days until you get a job.

83
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:41,909
So sit down and help yourself
to the goodies.

84
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,350
Over there.

85
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,622
What this?

86
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,524
That's pink lemonade.

87
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,860
You have pink lemons?

88
00:05:59,927 --> 00:06:01,595
Only in America.

89
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:06,066
Potato crumbs!
My favorite.

90
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:20,047
Color TV.

91
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:22,583
Yeah, haven't you ever seen
color TV before?

92
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:28,756
Of course I have.
Don't be ridiculous.

93
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:31,992
Blue!

94
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,897
On second thought,
I've seen all these colors.

95
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:38,966
Green and red
are gonna be on later.

96
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:42,836
You might wanna
stay up and watch.

97
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,672
I think
I'll just hit the sack.

98
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,708
I think
I'll just hit a sack.

99
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:50,043
I don't have a sack.

100
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,113
Well, you can sleep on
the couch. Turns into a bed.

101
00:06:56,684 --> 00:06:59,753
Of course it does!
This is America.

102
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:04,257
And don't worry about me.

103
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:06,860
Then, you shouldn't have a
problem. What's your profession?

104
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:10,030
I'm a professional sheepherder.

105
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,749
This is crazy.
A big city like Chicago

106
00:07:28,816 --> 00:07:30,818
there is not
one single advertisement

107
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:33,153
in here for a sheepherder.

108
00:07:34,822 --> 00:07:39,426
That's the way it goes.

109
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:41,595
What else do you do?

110
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:44,665
I am...a sheepherder.

111
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:47,568
My father was a sheepherder.

112
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:49,903
My grandfather
was a sheepherder.

113
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,005
The little baby--
I get the picture.

114
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:56,877
But you know,

115
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:59,179
For example,
I wanna be a photojournalist.

116
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:02,750
But then I've taken this job
to, to pay the bills.

117
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:08,021
You'll have to take a job
until an untended flock pops up.

118
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,599
Hello.
The Ritz.

119
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:21,969
What? Yeah.
Susan, calm down.

120
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:24,672
Yeah, well,
it's only a mouse.
They're cute.

121
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:27,074
Think of Mickey.

122
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,143
Mickey wouldn't try
to run up your leg.

123
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,581
Yeah, okay... Okay, okay.
I'll be right up.

124
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:36,950
I have to run upstairs

125
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,787
Balki, I want you to--
Want me to watch the store?

126
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:45,392
I want you to
watch the store.

127
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:49,396
Don't move.
Just stand there.
Can you do that?

128
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:53,300
You're not exactly pushing me
to my outer limits.

129
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,902
Stand there.

130
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:59,072
Ah!

131
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:02,576
That's the idea.

132
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:10,150
Uh...

133
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,685
Well, how much is it?

134
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:16,023
What the price tag says.

135
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:23,196
Well... You don't go by what
the price tag says, do you?

136
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:28,268
Of course not.
Don't be ridiculous.

137
00:09:29,637 --> 00:09:31,238
What do you go by?

138
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,710
We'll, uh, negotiate.

139
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:39,680
You are the head man here,
aren't you?

140
00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:42,582
Of course I am.

141
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,351
Come over here to me.

142
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:47,721
I'm not allowed to move.

143
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:54,995
♪ Oh what's love got to do

Cousin Larry, don't you notice
anything different?

148
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:14,181
No.
Look. Look. Look!

149
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:21,321
You did?
All without moving.

150
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:26,159
Well, that's great!

151
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:29,062
poking animals
up the hill with a stick.

152
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:34,935
And here's the money!

153
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,108
Forty-five dollars.

154
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:44,277
That was a couple hundred
dollars worth of stuff.

155
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:48,816
Where's the rest?
That's it.

156
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:50,851
Well, there were price tags
on that stuff.

157
00:10:50,918 --> 00:10:54,554
You don't go by
what's on the price tag.

158
00:10:54,621 --> 00:11:01,428
You don't?

159
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,932
I bartered like we do
at the marketplace on Mypos.

160
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,367
Balki, don't you realize
what you've done to me?

161
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:10,303
Yes and you're welcome.

162
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:13,774
You know, I think I should look
for a job as a salesperson.

163
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:23,817
Well, stick around.

164
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:28,789
Cousin Larry?

165
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:32,025
Cousin Larry

166
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:34,661
I'm so sorry.

167
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:37,397
Oh, bo bo bo.

168
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:40,367
Maybe Mr. Twinkacetti won't
notice these things are missing.

169
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,469
But you sold his hat rack.

170
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,505
Every day, the first thing
he does when he comes in

171
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:48,475
is put his hat on that rack.

172
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:52,345
Same damn thing every day.
Sunlight. It gets old.

173
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:04,057
Buy something or get out.

174
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,560
Where's the yo

175
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:11,531
Hi, Mr. Twinkacetti.
Rotten day, isn't it?

176
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:14,367
Why are you standing there
holding my hat on a stick?

177
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:17,104
Well, uh, technically,
it's a cane.

178
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,107
Well, uh, technically,
you're a jerk.

179
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:23,243
Where's my hat rack?

180
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,445
Mr. Twinkacetti.

181
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:29,282
I sold it.

182
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,684
Who are you?

183
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,788
My name is Balki, I'm Larry's
cousin, Philo, my fifth--

184
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:37,157
Who cares?
Why is he sellin' stuff?

185
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:38,992
Well, you wanna hear
a funny story?

186
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:43,296
No! Where's my money?

187
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:47,200
Forty five. Forty five bucks?
That hat rack was solid brass.

188
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,369
Where's the other 30?
That was my mistake.

189
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:53,406
But to make it up I won't charge
you for the hour I worked.

190
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:55,742
What a swell guy.

191
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:57,811
I want the rest of my money.

192
00:12:57,878 --> 00:12:59,246
Mr. Twinkacetti,
he doesn't have it.

193
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:02,549
But I could pay you back
if you give me a job.

194
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,485
I can fix things.

195
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:07,487
Why not? I'm young.

196
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:15,228
you could sell it for
more money,
it's a good idea.

197
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,064
If I wanna hear a good idea

198
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,099
I'll go to a smarter source
than you.

199
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,134
Like a wedge of cheese.

200
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:27,707
I can fix anything.

201
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:29,776
It just hung there
all limp and dangly.

202
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:31,611
And if I came up and did that

203
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:36,283
it would flip around like
the tassels on a belly dancer.

204
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:40,353
And she would say to me,
"Balki, don't do that."

205
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:45,458
And I said, "You give me that."
This what we do.

206
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:48,128
We take some nice mud,
and we make a cast.

207
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:49,796
And dry in the hot sun.

208
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:55,202
And six months later, I took off
the cast and what do you think?

209
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:59,072
The finger
is no more limp and dangly.

210
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:01,274
It won't bend at all.

211
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:05,312
Just sticks out
like a nail in a board.

212
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:13,420
I like that story.

213
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,091
Now get outta here.

214
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:19,893
Mr. Twinkacetti,
give him a chance.

215
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:24,364
How else can he pay you back?

216
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:26,934
Out of the way.
Let's see. A-ha!

217
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,969
Fix this old radio
and he's got a job.

218
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:32,139
Now, that's not fair. That radio
hasn't worked for 40 years!

219
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,975
Take it or leave it.
He'll take it. Can you fix it?

220
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:38,111
Of course I can.
It's probably
just the picture tube.

221
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:48,455
There you go, 15 points.

222
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:53,126
"Mypos?"
I challenge that.

223
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:54,861
Mypos is a real country.

224
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:58,498
I have a little corner of it
growing on my dining room table.

225
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:02,502
Cousin, I need to take a break.

226
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:05,272
I never knew fixing a radio
could be so quiet.

227
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:07,941
Susan, this is the cousin
I was telling you about.

228
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:09,943
Balki, meet Susan.
She's our neighbor.

229
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,479
Hi, nice to meet you.

230
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:15,315
Would... Would it be
impolite to ask

231
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:19,086
if I could be
your slave for life?

232
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,624
Oh, well, uh,
hah, I think that's illegal.

233
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:26,293
Oh, he's cute.

234
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:33,633
This cute Mediterranean boy
means every groveling word.

235
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:37,971
Take me and do with me
as you will.

236
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:41,174
You're embarrassing Susan.
Stand up. Act like a man.

237
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:45,512
Go work on the radio.

238
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:47,547
Then I take you
in my thoughts.

239
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:50,950
I want to worship
your painted toenails.

240
00:15:51,018 --> 00:15:54,387
Look, just leave with whatever
little dignity you have left.

241
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:57,624
Come on. Go.
Nice to meet you too.

242
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:05,398
I can die happy now.
Right.

243
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,702
He grovels great.

244
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:15,408
Sorry.

245
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:19,346
Oh, he's sweet. You know,
I hope he gets a job.

246
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:20,547
Susan, they haven't even made

247
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:22,682
parts for that radio
in 40 years.

248
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:25,952
Then he doesn't have a chance?
Well, I didn't say that.

249
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:30,290
See, Balki
doesn't know it but

250
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:34,127
and at the proper moment,
click "Dance Fever."

251
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:36,696
Twinkacetti will never know
the difference.

252
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:39,766
That's sneaky.
I know.

253
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,668
I'm very proud.

254
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:02,755
Good morning! Cheers!
On top of the day!

255
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:08,128
Well, you're in a good mood.

256
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:11,331
Today, I get
to laugh in a man's face.

257
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:15,068
Sounds like a good day to me.
Go for it, sport.

258
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:16,769
Balki, Balki.

259
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:23,110
Hey, grape leaf,
turn on the radio.

260
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:29,416
I...I fell asleep
before I got to test it.

261
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:32,352
But it'll work.
Balki fixed it.

262
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:35,588
You know it'll work,
and I know it'll work

263
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:38,491
but you don't.

264
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,927
You're gonna be so embarrassed
when that radio works--

265
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:43,330
Cousin Larry, what this?

266
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:50,503
Feeble.
Boy, that was feeble.

267
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:55,375
And you didn't think I'd
catch on? Ha ha! Turn it on!

268
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:59,312
All right.
Make yourselves ready.

269
00:18:16,996 --> 00:18:18,131
LARRY: You did it.

270
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:19,566
You did it.
I did it!

271
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:21,668
You actually did it.
You did it.

272
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:27,874
Look, look at this place.

273
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,110
I don't believe it.

274
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:33,546
What a great sound!
How much you want for it?

275
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:37,250
Three hundred.
Four hundred.

276
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:39,051
Five hundred bucks.
You got it.

277
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,853
Here's a $50 deposit.

278
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,823
And I'll go get my truck.
Yeah.

279
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:50,897
Can you fix...any radio?

280
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:55,335
Does Telly Savalas
love you, baby?

281
00:18:57,704 --> 00:19:01,241
My friend, my pal,
these fingers.

282
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:02,575
Muah! Muah!

283
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,644
You not only have
a job here...

284
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:07,146
Muah!

285
00:19:07,214 --> 00:19:11,751
I'll even pay
you...minimum wage. Shh!

286
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,088
Ah, boys, put this
little goldmine out

287
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,524
for our customer
to pick up.

288
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,026
On second thought, ah,
pinhead, do it yourself.

289
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:21,861
TWINKACETTI:
We wouldn't want
magic fingers here

290
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:26,098
to accidentally
hurt his hands... Oh.

291
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,335
Oh, Cousin Larry.

292
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:30,603
I help you anyway.
Thank you.

293
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,373
Of course. I tell you
where to put everything.

294
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,841
This goes right there.

295
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:37,477
And then we have
this amplifier to go on top.

296
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:39,912
And then, when you move
these two big speakers,

297
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:43,350
please be careful
because they're expensive.

298
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,519
You...you, uh...

299
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:50,022
You hooked all that stuff up
to that radio?

300
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:54,894
Of course. How else you got
to make it work? It was broke.

301
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:57,029
Mr. Twinkacetti,
something just occurred to me.

302
00:19:57,096 --> 00:20:00,533
I just sold a thousand bucks
worth of equipment for 500?

303
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,769
Damn, it occurred to you too.

304
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,939
You!

305
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:10,910
You brought him here.
This is all your fault.

306
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:14,514
You got your
walking papers...buster.

307
00:20:19,786 --> 00:20:21,554
Well, I hope you're happy.

308
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:24,257
Thank you.
I hope you're happy too.

309
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:29,061
Happy? Getting fired
does not make me happy.

310
00:20:29,128 --> 00:20:34,000
Fired? He just gave you
official papers to
take a nice walk.

311
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,635
That's American for fired.

312
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:38,571
It's a colorful language,
isn't it?

313
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:40,440
What?

314
00:20:40,507 --> 00:20:43,610
He can not do to you
what is my fault.

315
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:46,946
Mr. Twinkacetti. Ah!
Balki, Balki.

316
00:20:47,013 --> 00:20:50,317
You come out here right now,
you unfair person.

317
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:53,320
And I mean maybe.

318
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,862
Ah.

319
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:08,468
You have something to say

320
00:21:08,535 --> 00:21:12,271
You can't fire Larry.
He's a good person.

321
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:14,407
And if he goes, I go.

322
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:16,676
That goes without saying.

323
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:19,812
Now, I wanna see
heels going that way.

324
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:25,452
Not until I get
a few things off my neck.

325
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:27,487
You don't know
what kind of good fellow

326
00:21:27,554 --> 00:21:29,522
you're dumping to the birds.

327
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:31,791
He was always loyal to you.

328
00:21:31,858 --> 00:21:33,593
He make everything
perfect for you.

329
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,729
And you won't find
anyone to do better.

330
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:39,932
His only mistake
was to be good friend to me.

331
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:44,036
But the customer likes him,
and that's why they come back.

332
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:47,540
And if you let this good person
walk out that door,

333
00:21:47,607 --> 00:21:52,078
you're makin'
one big mistake, ghost buster.

334
00:21:55,715 --> 00:21:59,218
Thanks, but you're wasting
your time, Balki. Come on.

335
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:01,454
TWINKACETTI:
Wait a minute.

336
00:22:01,521 --> 00:22:03,890
Wait a minute, I, ah...

337
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:07,894
I was just thinking about
what the turnip said here, and

338
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,531
I'd be stupid to let either one
of you guys walk out that door.

339
00:22:11,598 --> 00:22:13,366
You're both hired again.

340
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:14,967
We are?

341
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:17,537
Why?

342
00:22:17,604 --> 00:22:21,307
Don't be ridiculous.

343
00:22:21,374 --> 00:22:23,142
Yes. No.

344
00:22:23,209 --> 00:22:25,244
It's because
you're both out of work persons.

345
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:28,080
And if you're not working,
I can't take $10 a week

346
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:30,750
out of your salary
to pay for the stereo stuff.

347
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:34,587
And the hat rack.
And all of this mess.

348
00:22:34,654 --> 00:22:38,024
Gentlemen and turnip,

349
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:41,394
welcome to the wonderful
world of being in debt.

350
00:22:41,461 --> 00:22:43,463
Ha ha ha.

351
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:48,401
Am I in debt?
Yep.

352
00:22:49,736 --> 00:22:51,904
I'm a true American.

353
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:58,745
Well, Balki,
you got us our jobs back.

354
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:02,949
Well, where I come from
family sticks together.

355
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:10,857
Isn't this just like America?
Another happy ending.

356
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:12,825
Yeah.
We're buddies.

357
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,661
Yeah.
We're working together.

358
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,262
Yeah.
We're roommates.

359
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:19,331
We have to talk.

360
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:23,135
Now, you see, you couldn't have
this talk if you lived alone.

361
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:25,572
You need me.

362
00:23:25,638 --> 00:23:30,409
And this may surprise you
but...I need you too.

363
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:33,045
You saved my life.

364
00:23:36,483 --> 00:23:39,919
Well, it is nice to have
somebody to talk to.

365
00:23:39,986 --> 00:23:43,389
You're welcome to stay until you
can afford a place of your own.

366
00:23:43,456 --> 00:23:44,957
No problem.

367
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:49,195
I have a job now
that pays minimum wage. Shh!

368
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,166
and put my whole family
through college

369
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:56,969
I'm gone like a bird.

370
00:23:57,036 --> 00:24:02,509
Balki, do you have any idea
how much minimum wage is?

371
00:24:02,575 --> 00:24:08,447
Of course I do.
Don't be ridiculous.
