NARRATOR: "I call Heaven and Earth
to witness against you this day...

2
00:00:43,883 --> 00:00:47,717
...that I have set before thee
life and death...

3
00:00:47,921 --> 00:00:50,583
...the blessing and the curse.

4
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,953
Therefore choose life,
that thou mayest live...

5
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,720
...thou and thy seed."

6
00:01:11,144 --> 00:01:14,170
SAGAN: Nearly 200 years ago,
in the Gulf of Alaska...

7
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,211
...at a place called Lituya Bay...

8
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:21,319
...two cultures that had never
met experienced a first encounter.

9
00:01:22,088 --> 00:01:23,282
The Tlingit people...

10
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:26,822
...lived more or less as their
ancestors had for thousands of years.

11
00:01:27,026 --> 00:01:28,118
They were nomads...

12
00:01:28,328 --> 00:01:31,297
...moving often by canoe
between numerous campsites...

13
00:01:31,497 --> 00:01:34,193
...where they caught plentiful
fish and sea otters...

14
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,561
...and traded with neighboring tribes.

15
00:01:41,207 --> 00:01:44,973
(SPEAKS IN TLINGIT)

16
00:01:45,578 --> 00:01:48,308
The creator they worshiped
was the raven god...

17
00:01:48,514 --> 00:01:52,041
...whom they pictured as an enormous
black bird with white wings.

18
00:01:52,251 --> 00:01:54,742
And one July day in 1786...

19
00:01:55,054 --> 00:01:57,249
...the raven god appeared.

20
00:02:00,693 --> 00:02:02,490
The Tlingit were terrified.

21
00:02:02,695 --> 00:02:07,359
They knew that anyone looking directly
at the god would be turned to stone.

22
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:18,169
From the other side of the planet
had come an expedition...

23
00:02:18,378 --> 00:02:20,903
...led by the French
explorer La P?rouse.

24
00:02:21,114 --> 00:02:26,051
It was the most elaborately planned
scientific voyage of the century...

25
00:02:26,285 --> 00:02:29,846
...sent around the world to gather
knowledge about the geography...

26
00:02:30,056 --> 00:02:33,423
...natural history and peoples
of distant lands.

27
00:02:38,131 --> 00:02:39,496
But to the Tlingit...

28
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:44,193
...whose world was confined to the
islands and inlets of south Alaska...

29
00:02:44,404 --> 00:02:48,841
...this great vessel could have
come only from the gods.

30
00:02:53,613 --> 00:02:57,515
There was one among them who
dared to look more deeply.

31
00:02:57,717 --> 00:03:00,447
He was an old warrior,
and nearly blind.

32
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,616
He said that his life
was almost over.

33
00:03:03,823 --> 00:03:06,519
For the common good, he would
approach the raven...

34
00:03:06,726 --> 00:03:11,663
...to learn whether the god really
would turn his people to stone.

35
00:03:26,179 --> 00:03:29,671
He set out on his own
voyage of discovery...

36
00:03:30,016 --> 00:03:33,247
...to confront the end of the world.

37
00:04:41,254 --> 00:04:44,746
The old man made himself
look hard at the raven...

38
00:04:44,957 --> 00:04:48,085
...and saw that it was not a
great bird from the sky...

39
00:04:48,294 --> 00:04:51,127
...but the work of men like himself.

40
00:04:55,968 --> 00:04:59,165
This first encounter turned
out to be peaceful.

41
00:04:59,372 --> 00:05:02,466
Men of the La P?rouse expedition
were under orders...

42
00:05:02,675 --> 00:05:06,076
...to treat with respect
any people they might discover.

43
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:09,908
An exceptional policy
for its time, and after.

44
00:05:10,116 --> 00:05:12,778
La P?rouse and the Tlingit
exchanged goods...

45
00:05:12,985 --> 00:05:17,615
...and then the strange ship
sailed away, never to return.

46
00:05:18,758 --> 00:05:23,058
Not all encounters between nations
had been so peaceful.

47
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,098
Before 1519...

48
00:05:26,299 --> 00:05:28,699
...the Aztecs of Mexico had
never seen a gun.

49
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:31,836
They too believed at first
that their strange visitors...

50
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:34,131
...had come from the sky.

51
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,281
The Spaniards under Cortez...

52
00:05:49,488 --> 00:05:52,457
...were not constrained by
any injunctions against violence.

53
00:05:52,658 --> 00:05:56,617
Their true nature and intentions
soon became clear.

54
00:06:12,178 --> 00:06:14,078
Unlike the La P?rouse expedition...

55
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,011
...the Conquistadors sought,
not knowledge, but gold.

56
00:06:18,718 --> 00:06:22,381
They used their superior weapons
to loot and murder.

57
00:06:22,588 --> 00:06:27,218
In their madness, they
obliterated a civilization.

58
00:06:34,567 --> 00:06:36,467
In the name of piety...

59
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:38,534
...in a mockery of their religion...

60
00:06:38,738 --> 00:06:41,673
...the Spaniards utterly
destroyed a society...

61
00:06:41,874 --> 00:06:44,365
...with an art, astronomy,
and architecture...

62
00:06:44,577 --> 00:06:46,772
...the equal of anything in Europe.

63
00:06:50,049 --> 00:06:53,985
We revile the Conquistadors for their
cruelty and shortsightedness...

64
00:06:54,186 --> 00:06:55,847
...for choosing death.

65
00:06:56,055 --> 00:07:00,082
We admire La P?rouse and the Tlingit
for their courage and wisdom...

66
00:07:00,293 --> 00:07:02,887
...for choosing life.

67
00:07:03,095 --> 00:07:05,063
The choice is with us still.

68
00:07:05,264 --> 00:07:09,701
But the civilization now in
jeopardy is all humanity.

69
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,896
As the ancient mythmakers knew...

70
00:07:14,106 --> 00:07:17,166
...we're children equally
of the Earth and sky.

71
00:07:17,376 --> 00:07:19,503
In our tenure on this planet...

72
00:07:19,712 --> 00:07:23,148
...we've accumulated dangerous
evolutionary baggage:

73
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:25,681
Propensities for
aggression and ritual...

74
00:07:25,885 --> 00:07:29,753
...submission to leaders,
hostility to outsiders.

75
00:07:29,955 --> 00:07:33,413
All of which puts our
survival in some doubt.

76
00:07:33,626 --> 00:07:36,117
But we've also acquired
compassion for others...

77
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:37,455
...love for our children...

78
00:07:37,663 --> 00:07:40,359
...a desire to learn from
history and experience...

79
00:07:40,566 --> 00:07:44,297
...and a great, soaring,
passionate intelligence.

80
00:07:44,503 --> 00:07:49,202
The clear tools for our continued
survival and prosperity.

81
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,808
Which aspects of our nature
will prevail...

82
00:07:57,016 --> 00:07:58,347
...is uncertain.

83
00:07:58,551 --> 00:08:02,317
Particularly when our visions and
prospects are bound...

84
00:08:02,521 --> 00:08:06,389
...to one small part of
the small planet Earth.

85
00:08:06,592 --> 00:08:08,253
But up there in the cosmos...

86
00:08:08,461 --> 00:08:11,624
...an inescapable perspective awaits.

87
00:08:11,831 --> 00:08:15,961
National boundaries are not evident
when we view the Earth from space.

88
00:08:16,168 --> 00:08:19,467
Fanatic ethnic or religious
or national identifications...

89
00:08:19,672 --> 00:08:21,572
...are difficult to support...

90
00:08:21,774 --> 00:08:25,141
...when we see our planet
as a fragile blue crescent...

91
00:08:25,344 --> 00:08:28,507
...fading to become an inconspicuous
point of light...

92
00:08:28,714 --> 00:08:33,083
...against the bastion and citadel
of the stars.

93
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,082
There are not yet obvious signs of
extraterrestrial intelligence...

94
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:40,417
...and this makes us wonder whether
civilizations like ours...

95
00:08:40,626 --> 00:08:44,460
...rush inevitably, headlong
to self-destruction.

96
00:08:44,663 --> 00:08:46,028
I dream about it.

97
00:08:46,232 --> 00:08:49,690
And sometimes they're bad dreams.

98
00:09:02,615 --> 00:09:04,344
In the vision of a dream...

99
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,381
...I once imagined myself...

100
00:09:06,585 --> 00:09:10,180
...searching for other civilizations
in the cosmos.

101
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:12,721
Among a hundred billion galaxies...

102
00:09:12,925 --> 00:09:14,916
...and a billion trillion stars...

103
00:09:15,127 --> 00:09:19,621
...life and intelligence should
have arisen on many worlds.

104
00:09:21,634 --> 00:09:25,365
Some worlds are barren
and desolate...

105
00:09:25,571 --> 00:09:27,698
...on them life never began...

106
00:09:27,907 --> 00:09:32,037
...or may have been extinguished
in some cosmic catastrophe.

107
00:09:32,244 --> 00:09:34,178
There may be worlds rich in life...

108
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:39,215
...but not yet evolved to
intelligence and high technology.

109
00:09:39,418 --> 00:09:42,615
There may be civilizations
that achieve technology...

110
00:09:42,822 --> 00:09:46,952
...and then promptly use it
to destroy themselves.

111
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:49,719
And perhaps
there are also beings...

112
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:52,659
...who learned to live with their
technology and themselves.

113
00:09:52,865 --> 00:09:54,628
Beings who endure...

114
00:09:54,834 --> 00:09:58,861
...and become citizens of the cosmos.

115
00:10:11,217 --> 00:10:12,878
Immersed in these thoughts...

116
00:10:13,085 --> 00:10:16,782
...I found myself approaching
a world that was clearly inhabited...

117
00:10:16,989 --> 00:10:19,457
...a world I had visited before.

118
00:10:19,658 --> 00:10:23,116
I saw a planet encompassed by light...

119
00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:27,060
...and recognized the signature
of intelligence.

120
00:10:32,104 --> 00:10:33,571
But suddenly...

121
00:10:33,772 --> 00:10:37,902
...darkness, total and absolute.

122
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:50,249
In my dream...

123
00:10:50,456 --> 00:10:53,050
...I could read the Book of Worlds.

124
00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:54,988

125
00:10:55,194 --> 00:10:58,459
...of a billion planets
within the Milky Way.

126
00:11:15,714 --> 00:11:17,909
What could the computer tell me...

127
00:11:18,117 --> 00:11:21,883
...about this now-darkened world?

128
00:11:32,097 --> 00:11:35,965
They must have survived
some earlier catastrophe.

129
00:11:39,171 --> 00:11:41,901
Locally initiated contact:

130
00:11:42,107 --> 00:11:44,337
Maybe their television broadcasts.

131
00:11:46,211 --> 00:11:49,647
Their biology was different
from ours.

132
00:11:52,685 --> 00:11:53,982
High technology.

133
00:11:54,186 --> 00:11:57,121
I wondered what those
lights had been for.

134
00:11:59,925 --> 00:12:02,086
There must have been
signs of trouble.

135
00:12:02,294 --> 00:12:04,660
Probability of survival
in a century...

136
00:12:04,863 --> 00:12:07,991

They had made the ultimate mistake.

140
00:12:20,212 --> 00:12:24,148
I felt a longing
to return to Earth.

141
00:12:26,018 --> 00:12:29,385
The television transmissions
of Earth rushed past me...

...expanding away from our planet

161
00:14:24,103 --> 00:14:26,469
We had poisoned the air and water.

162
00:14:26,672 --> 00:14:29,004
We had ravaged the land.

163
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,971
Perhaps we had changed the climate.

164
00:14:31,877 --> 00:14:33,777
Could it have been a plague...

165
00:14:35,013 --> 00:14:36,878
...or nuclear war?

166
00:14:44,556 --> 00:14:47,650
I remembered the galactic computer.

167
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,192
What would it say about the Earth?

168
00:14:57,369 --> 00:14:59,769
There was our region of the galaxy.

169
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:09,643
There was our world.

170
00:15:09,848 --> 00:15:12,874
I had found the entry for Earth.

171
00:15:14,253 --> 00:15:17,586
Humanity, third from the sun.

172
00:15:22,795 --> 00:15:25,093
They had heard our
television broadcasts...

173
00:15:25,297 --> 00:15:29,063
...and thought them an application
for cosmic citizenship.

174
00:15:31,036 --> 00:15:33,129
Our technology had been
growing enormously.

175
00:15:33,338 --> 00:15:34,862
They got that right.

176
00:15:37,543 --> 00:15:39,067
200 nation states.

177
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:41,007
About six global powers.

178
00:15:41,213 --> 00:15:44,148
The potential to become one planet.

179
00:15:44,449 --> 00:15:48,215
Probability of survival over
a century, here also...

180
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,945
...less than l% .

181
00:15:56,962 --> 00:15:59,226
So it was nuclear war.

182
00:15:59,431 --> 00:16:02,764
A full nuclear exchange.

183
00:16:02,968 --> 00:16:06,062
There would be no more
big questions.

184
00:16:06,271 --> 00:16:08,262
No more answers.

185
00:16:08,473 --> 00:16:11,965
Never again a love or a child.

186
00:16:12,177 --> 00:16:15,544
No descendants to remember us
and be proud.

187
00:16:15,747 --> 00:16:18,807
No more voyages to the stars.

188
00:16:19,017 --> 00:16:22,009
No more songs from the Earth.

189
00:16:27,025 --> 00:16:29,152
I saw East Africa...

190
00:16:29,361 --> 00:16:31,659
...and thought a few
million years ago...

191
00:16:31,864 --> 00:16:34,298
...we humans took our
first steps there.

192
00:16:34,499 --> 00:16:37,024
Our brains grew and changed.

193
00:16:37,236 --> 00:16:40,672
The old parts began to be
guided by the new parts.

194
00:16:40,873 --> 00:16:41,999
And this made us human...

195
00:16:42,207 --> 00:16:46,439
...with compassion and foresight
and reason.

196
00:16:46,645 --> 00:16:51,241
But instead, we listened to that
reptilian voice within us...

197
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:54,977
...counseling fear, territoriality...

198
00:16:55,187 --> 00:16:56,745
...aggression.

199
00:16:56,955 --> 00:16:59,355
We accepted the products of science.

200
00:16:59,558 --> 00:17:01,890
We rejected its methods.

201
00:17:03,595 --> 00:17:06,860
Maybe the reptiles will evolve
intelligence once more.

202
00:17:07,065 --> 00:17:11,695
Perhaps, one day, there will be
civilizations again on Earth.

203
00:17:11,904 --> 00:17:13,235
There will be life.

204
00:17:13,438 --> 00:17:15,736
There will be intelligence.

205
00:17:15,941 --> 00:17:17,636
But there will be no more humans.

206
00:17:17,843 --> 00:17:22,041
Not here, not on a billion worlds.

207
00:17:45,103 --> 00:17:49,506
Every thinking person
fears nuclear war...

208
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:53,542
...and every technological nation
plans for it.

209
00:17:54,947 --> 00:17:57,507
Everyone knows it's madness...

210
00:17:57,716 --> 00:18:01,652
...and every country has an excuse.

211
00:18:01,853 --> 00:18:06,790
There's a dreary chain of causality.

212
00:18:07,025 --> 00:18:09,994
The Germans were
working on the bomb...

213
00:18:10,195 --> 00:18:12,095
...at the beginning of World War II.

214
00:18:12,297 --> 00:18:15,357
So the Americans
had to make one first.

215
00:18:15,567 --> 00:18:19,435
If the Americans had one,
the Russians had to have one.

216
00:18:21,373 --> 00:18:24,069
Then, the British, the French...

217
00:18:24,276 --> 00:18:27,143
...the Chinese, the Indians,
the Pakistanis.

218
00:18:27,346 --> 00:18:30,907
Many nations now collect
nuclear weapons.

219
00:18:31,116 --> 00:18:33,346
They're easy to make.

220
00:18:33,552 --> 00:18:38,251
You can steal fissionable material
from nuclear reactors.

221
00:18:38,457 --> 00:18:43,394
Nuclear weapons have almost become
a home handicraft industry.

222
00:18:44,296 --> 00:18:48,596
The conventional bombs of World War II
were called "blockbusters."

223
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:53,533
Filled with 20 tons of TNT, they
could destroy a city block.

224
00:18:53,739 --> 00:18:57,231
All the bombs dropped on all the
cities of World War II...

225
00:18:57,442 --> 00:18:59,967
...amounted to some
2 million tons of TNT.

226
00:19:00,178 --> 00:19:01,805
Two megatons.

227
00:19:02,014 --> 00:19:04,278
Coventry and Rotterdam.

228
00:19:04,483 --> 00:19:05,973
Dresden and Tokyo.

229
00:19:06,184 --> 00:19:08,516
All the death that rained
from the skies...

230
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,712
...between 1939 and 1945.

231
00:19:11,923 --> 00:19:16,792
100,000 blockbusters.
Two megatons.

232
00:19:16,995 --> 00:19:21,489
Today, two megatons is the equivalent
of a single thermonuclear bomb.

233
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,692
One bomb with the destructive force...

234
00:19:24,903 --> 00:19:27,531
...of the Second World War.

235
00:19:27,739 --> 00:19:30,264
But there are tens of thousands
of nuclear weapons.

236
00:19:30,475 --> 00:19:33,501
The missile and bomber forces
of the Soviet Union and U. S...

237
00:19:33,712 --> 00:19:38,149
...have warheads aimed at over
15,000 designated targets.

238
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:41,148
No place on the planet is safe.

239
00:19:41,353 --> 00:19:44,015
The energy contained
in these weapons...

240
00:19:44,222 --> 00:19:45,951
...genies of death...

241
00:19:46,158 --> 00:19:50,561
...patiently awaiting
the rubbing of the lamps...

242
00:19:50,762 --> 00:19:53,390
...totals far more than
10,000 megatons.

243
00:19:53,598 --> 00:19:57,193
But with the destruction
concentrated efficiently...

244
00:19:57,402 --> 00:20:00,633
...not over six years,
but over a few hours.

245
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:04,775
A blockbuster for every family
on the planet.

246
00:20:04,976 --> 00:20:07,843
A World War II every second...

247
00:20:08,046 --> 00:20:11,607
...for the length of a lazy afternoon.

248
00:20:13,185 --> 00:20:15,050
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

249
00:20:17,522 --> 00:20:19,183
The bomb dropped on Hiroshima...

250
00:20:19,391 --> 00:20:21,916
...killed 70,000 people.

251
00:20:22,127 --> 00:20:24,322
In a full nuclear exchange...

252
00:20:24,529 --> 00:20:27,191
...in the paroxysm of global death...

253
00:20:27,399 --> 00:20:30,232
...the equivalent of
a million Hiroshima bombs...

254
00:20:30,435 --> 00:20:33,199
...would be dropped all
over the world.

255
00:20:33,405 --> 00:20:35,430
In such an exchange
not everyone would be...

256
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,701
...killed by the blast and firestorm
and the immediate radiation.

257
00:20:39,911 --> 00:20:42,539
There would be other agonies:

258
00:20:42,747 --> 00:20:43,736
Loss of loved ones...

259
00:20:43,949 --> 00:20:48,352
...the legions of the burned and
blinded and mutilated...

260
00:20:48,553 --> 00:20:50,248
...the absence of medical care...

261
00:20:50,455 --> 00:20:51,786
...disease, plague...

262
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:56,051
...long-lived radiation poisoning
of the soil and the water.

263
00:20:56,261 --> 00:21:01,130
The threat of tumors and stillbirths
and malformed children.

264
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:04,894
And the hopeless sense of
a civilization destroyed for nothing.

265
00:21:05,103 --> 00:21:09,199
The knowledge that we could have
prevented it and did not.

266
00:21:12,077 --> 00:21:15,444
The global balance of terror...

267
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:18,411
...pioneered by the U.S.
and the Soviet Union...

268
00:21:18,617 --> 00:21:22,053
...holds hostage
all the citizens of the Earth.

269
00:21:22,254 --> 00:21:24,848
Each side persistently probes...

270
00:21:25,056 --> 00:21:27,456
...the limits of
the other's tolerance...

271
00:21:27,659 --> 00:21:31,390
...like the Cuban missile crisis...

272
00:21:31,897 --> 00:21:34,161
...the testing of
anti-satellite weapons...

273
00:21:34,366 --> 00:21:36,857
...the Vietnam and Afghanistan wars.

274
00:21:37,068 --> 00:21:39,036
The hostile military
establishments are...

275
00:21:39,237 --> 00:21:43,037
...locked in some ghastly
mutual embrace.

276
00:21:43,241 --> 00:21:44,970
Each needs the other.

277
00:21:45,177 --> 00:21:48,908
But the balance of terror
is a delicate balance...

278
00:21:49,114 --> 00:21:52,641
...with very little margin
for miscalculation.

279
00:21:54,219 --> 00:21:58,019
And the world impoverishes
itself by spending...

280
00:21:58,723 --> 00:22:03,160
...a trillion dollars a year
on preparations for war.

281
00:22:03,361 --> 00:22:04,953
And by employing perhaps...

282
00:22:05,163 --> 00:22:08,223
...half the scientists and high
technologists on the planet...

283
00:22:08,433 --> 00:22:10,560
...in military endeavors.

284
00:22:12,771 --> 00:22:14,466
How would we explain all this...

285
00:22:14,673 --> 00:22:17,039
...to a dispassionate
extraterrestrial observer?

286
00:22:17,242 --> 00:22:21,076
What account would we give
of our stewardship...

287
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:22,746
...of the planet Earth?

288
00:22:22,948 --> 00:22:26,406
We have heard the rationales
offered by the superpowers.

289
00:22:26,618 --> 00:22:29,246
We know who speaks
for the nations.

290
00:22:29,454 --> 00:22:31,922
But who speaks
for the human species?

291
00:22:32,123 --> 00:22:34,182
Who speaks for Earth?

292
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,558
From an extraterrestrial perspective,
our global civilization is...

293
00:22:39,764 --> 00:22:42,198
...clearly on the edge of failure...

294
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,300
...in the most important task it faces:

295
00:22:44,502 --> 00:22:47,938
Preserving the lives and well-being
of its citizens...

296
00:22:48,139 --> 00:22:51,302
...and the future habitability
of the planet.

297
00:22:51,509 --> 00:22:55,946
But if we're willing to live with the
growing likelihood of nuclear war...

298
00:22:56,147 --> 00:22:59,310
...shouldn't we also be willing
to explore vigorously...

299
00:22:59,517 --> 00:23:02,145
...every possible means to
prevent nuclear war?

300
00:23:02,354 --> 00:23:05,050
Shouldn't we consider,
in every nation...

301
00:23:05,257 --> 00:23:08,317
...major changes in the traditional
ways of doing things?

302
00:23:08,526 --> 00:23:10,323
A fundamental restructuring...

303
00:23:10,528 --> 00:23:14,157
...of economic, political,
social and religious institutions?

304
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:17,499
We've reached a point where
there can be no more...

305
00:23:17,702 --> 00:23:19,602
...special interests or cases.

306
00:23:19,938 --> 00:23:23,465
Nuclear arms threaten every
person on Earth.

307
00:23:24,843 --> 00:23:29,246
Fundamental changes in society
are sometimes labeled...

308
00:23:29,447 --> 00:23:33,645
...impractical or contrary
to human nature...

309
00:23:33,852 --> 00:23:36,150
...as if nuclear war were practical...

310
00:23:36,354 --> 00:23:39,346
...or as if there were only
one human nature.

311
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:42,552
But fundamental changes can
clearly be made.

312
00:23:42,761 --> 00:23:44,729
We're surrounded by them.

313
00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:47,591
In the last two centuries,
abject slavery...

314
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:50,359
...which was with us for
thousands of years...

315
00:23:50,568 --> 00:23:52,661
...has almost entirely
been eliminated...

316
00:23:52,871 --> 00:23:55,465
...in a stirring
worldwide revolution.

317
00:23:55,674 --> 00:23:59,269
Women, systematically mistreated
for millennia...

318
00:23:59,477 --> 00:24:02,378
...are gradually gaining the political
and economic power...

319
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,844
...traditionally denied to them.

320
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:09,646
And some wars of aggression have
recently been stopped or curtailed...

321
00:24:09,854 --> 00:24:12,084
...because of a revulsion...

322
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:15,453
...felt by the people in
the aggressor nations.

323
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,787
The old appeals...

324
00:24:17,996 --> 00:24:20,897
...to racial, sexual,
and religious chauvinism...

325
00:24:21,099 --> 00:24:24,364
...and to rabid nationalist fervor...

326
00:24:24,569 --> 00:24:26,400
...are beginning not to work.

327
00:24:26,604 --> 00:24:30,267
A new consciousness is developing
which sees the Earth as...

328
00:24:30,475 --> 00:24:31,999
...a single organism...

329
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:36,340
...and recognizes that an organism
at war with itself...

330
00:24:36,548 --> 00:24:37,981
...is doomed.

331
00:24:38,183 --> 00:24:40,913
We are one planet.

332
00:24:42,921 --> 00:24:46,550
One of the great revelations of
the age of space exploration...

333
00:24:46,758 --> 00:24:49,886
...is the image of the Earth,
finite and lonely...

334
00:24:50,095 --> 00:24:54,964
...somehow vulnerable, bearing
the entire human species...

335
00:24:55,166 --> 00:24:58,897
...through the oceans
of space and time.

336
00:24:59,104 --> 00:25:01,470
But this is an ancient perception.

337
00:25:01,673 --> 00:25:03,436
In the 3rd century B. C...

338
00:25:03,641 --> 00:25:06,132
...our planet was mapped and
accurately measured...

339
00:25:06,344 --> 00:25:10,474
...by a Greek scientist named
Eratosthenes, who worked in Egypt.

340
00:25:10,682 --> 00:25:13,276
This was the world as he knew it.

341
00:25:14,052 --> 00:25:16,384
Eratosthenes was the director...

342
00:25:16,588 --> 00:25:19,284
...of the great Library
of Alexandria...

343
00:25:19,491 --> 00:25:23,757
...the center of science and learning
in the ancient world.

344
00:25:24,996 --> 00:25:29,057
Aristotle had argued that humanity
was divided into Greeks...

345
00:25:29,267 --> 00:25:33,169
...and everybody else,
who he called "barbarians"...

346
00:25:33,371 --> 00:25:37,398
...and that the Greeks should keep
themselves racially pure.

347
00:25:37,609 --> 00:25:41,978
He taught that it was fitting for
the Greeks to enslave other peoples.

348
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:46,947
But Eratosthenes criticized Aristotle
for his blind chauvinism.

349
00:25:47,152 --> 00:25:51,316
He believed there was good and bad
in every nation.

350
00:25:51,523 --> 00:25:55,823
The Greek conquerors had invented
a new god for the Egyptians...

351
00:25:56,027 --> 00:25:59,224
...but he looked remarkably Greek.

352
00:25:59,431 --> 00:26:01,956
Alexander was portrayed as pharaoh...

353
00:26:02,167 --> 00:26:04,431
...in a gesture to the Egyptians.

354
00:26:04,636 --> 00:26:09,130
But in practice, the Greeks were
confident of their superiority.

355
00:26:10,141 --> 00:26:14,134
The protests of the librarian hardly
constituted a serious challenge...

356
00:26:14,345 --> 00:26:16,142
...to prevailing prejudices.

357
00:26:16,347 --> 00:26:19,214
Their world was as imperfect
as our own.

358
00:26:19,417 --> 00:26:23,012
But the Ptolemies, the Greek kings of
Egypt who followed Alexander...

359
00:26:23,221 --> 00:26:25,086
...had at least this virtue:

360
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:28,453
They supported the advancement
of knowledge.

361
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,993
Popular ideas about the nature of
the cosmos were challenged...

362
00:26:32,197 --> 00:26:34,097
...and some of them, discarded.

363
00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:35,857
New ideas were proposed...

364
00:26:36,067 --> 00:26:38,535
...and found to be in
better accord with the facts.

365
00:26:38,736 --> 00:26:41,603
There were imaginative proposals,
vigorous debates...

366
00:26:41,806 --> 00:26:43,171
...brilliant syntheses.

367
00:26:43,374 --> 00:26:45,342
The resulting treasure
of knowledge...

368
00:26:45,543 --> 00:26:48,444
...was recorded and preserved
for centuries...

369
00:26:48,646 --> 00:26:51,114
...on these shelves.

370
00:26:52,484 --> 00:26:56,352
Science came of age
in this library.

371
00:26:58,957 --> 00:27:03,087
The Ptolemies didn't merely
collect old knowledge.

372
00:27:03,294 --> 00:27:06,991
They supported scientific research
and generated new knowledge.

373
00:27:07,198 --> 00:27:08,995
The results were amazing.

374
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,603
Eratosthenes accurately calculated
the size of the Earth.

375
00:27:13,805 --> 00:27:14,897
He mapped it...

376
00:27:15,106 --> 00:27:18,303
...and he argued that it could be
circumnavigated.

377
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:22,537
Hipparchus anticipated that
stars come into being...

378
00:27:22,747 --> 00:27:25,307
...slowly move during the course
of centuries...

379
00:27:25,517 --> 00:27:26,848
...and eventually perish.

380
00:27:27,051 --> 00:27:29,042
It was he who first catalogued...

381
00:27:29,254 --> 00:27:31,984
...the positions and magnitudes
of the stars...

382
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:35,453
...in order to determine whether
there were such changes.

383
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:38,458
Euclid produced a textbook
on geometry...

384
00:27:38,663 --> 00:27:41,826
...which human beings learned from
for 23 centuries.

385
00:27:42,033 --> 00:27:46,766
It's still a great read, full
of the most elegant proofs.

386
00:27:46,971 --> 00:27:50,566
Galen wrote basic works on
healing and anatomy...

387
00:27:50,775 --> 00:27:53,505
...which dominated medicine
until the Renaissance.

388
00:27:53,711 --> 00:27:55,372
These are just a few examples.

389
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,912
There were dozens of
great scholars here...

390
00:27:58,116 --> 00:28:01,882
...and hundreds of fundamental
discoveries.

391
00:28:06,224 --> 00:28:09,625
Some of those discoveries have
a distinctly modern ring.

392
00:28:09,827 --> 00:28:13,763
Apollonius of Perga studied
the parabola and the ellipse...

393
00:28:13,965 --> 00:28:17,731
...curves that we know today describe
the paths of falling objects...

394
00:28:17,936 --> 00:28:19,301
...in a gravitational field...

395
00:28:19,504 --> 00:28:22,735
...and space vehicles traveling
between the planets.

396
00:28:22,941 --> 00:28:27,378
Heron of Alexandria invented
steam engines and gear trains...

397
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:31,413
...he was the author of
the first book on robots.

398
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:34,949
Imagine how different our world
would be if those discoveries...

399
00:28:35,153 --> 00:28:37,883
...had been used
for the benefit of everyone.

400
00:28:38,089 --> 00:28:40,956
If the humane perspective
of Eratosthenes...

401
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:43,423
...had been widely
adopted and applied.

402
00:28:43,628 --> 00:28:46,529
But this was not to be.

403
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:51,596
Alexandria was the greatest city...

404
00:28:51,803 --> 00:28:54,897
...the Western world had ever seen.

405
00:28:55,106 --> 00:28:57,074
People from all nations came here...

406
00:28:57,275 --> 00:28:59,470
...to live, to trade, to learn.

407
00:28:59,677 --> 00:29:01,201
On a given day...

408
00:29:01,412 --> 00:29:04,404
...these harbors were thronged...

409
00:29:04,616 --> 00:29:08,074
...with merchants and scholars,
tourists.

410
00:29:08,286 --> 00:29:09,480
It's probably here...

411
00:29:09,687 --> 00:29:13,214
...that the word "cosmopolitan"
realized its true meaning...

412
00:29:13,424 --> 00:29:16,689
...of a citizen,
not just of a nation...

413
00:29:16,894 --> 00:29:18,828
...but of the cosmos.

414
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:23,967
To be a citizen of the cosmos.

415
00:29:24,669 --> 00:29:28,799
Here were clearly the seeds
of our modern world.

416
00:29:29,007 --> 00:29:31,976
But why didn't they
take root and flourish?

417
00:29:32,176 --> 00:29:36,545
Why, instead, did the West slumber
through 1000 years of darkness...

418
00:29:36,748 --> 00:29:40,514
...until Columbus and Copernicus
and their contemporaries...

419
00:29:40,718 --> 00:29:44,119
...rediscovered the work done here?

420
00:29:44,322 --> 00:29:46,552
I cannot give you a simple answer...

421
00:29:46,758 --> 00:29:48,623
...but I do know this:

422
00:29:48,826 --> 00:29:52,660
There is no record in the entire
history of the library...

423
00:29:52,864 --> 00:29:56,800
...that any of the illustrious scholars
and scientists who worked here...

424
00:29:57,001 --> 00:29:59,333
...ever seriously challenged...

425
00:29:59,537 --> 00:30:03,769
...a single political or economic
or religious assumption...

426
00:30:03,975 --> 00:30:06,273
...of the society in which they lived.

427
00:30:06,477 --> 00:30:10,436
The permanence of the stars
was questioned.

428
00:30:10,648 --> 00:30:14,516
The justice of slavery was not.

429
00:30:29,967 --> 00:30:33,198
Science and learning in general...

430
00:30:33,404 --> 00:30:36,032
...were the preserve
of the privileged few.

431
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,370
The vast population of this city
had not the vaguest notion...

432
00:30:40,578 --> 00:30:44,344
...of the great discoveries being
made within these walls.

433
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:45,948
How could they?

434
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:49,881
The new findings were not
explained or popularized.

435
00:30:50,088 --> 00:30:53,489
The progress made here
benefited them little.

436
00:30:53,691 --> 00:30:56,216
Science was not part of their lives.

437
00:30:56,427 --> 00:30:59,419
The discoveries in mechanics, say...

438
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,461
...or steam technology...

439
00:31:01,666 --> 00:31:05,568
...mainly were applied to
the perfection of weapons...

440
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:08,068
...to the encouragement
of superstition...

441
00:31:08,272 --> 00:31:10,240
...to the amusement of kings.

442
00:31:10,441 --> 00:31:14,309
Scientists never seemed to grasp
the enormous potential...

443
00:31:14,512 --> 00:31:17,447
...of machines to free people...

444
00:31:17,648 --> 00:31:21,277
...from arduous and repetitive labor.

445
00:31:21,486 --> 00:31:23,647
The intellectual achievements
of antiquity...

446
00:31:23,855 --> 00:31:26,517
...had few practical applications.

447
00:31:26,724 --> 00:31:31,661
Science never captured
the imagination of the multitude.

448
00:31:32,163 --> 00:31:35,690
There was no counterbalance
to stagnation, to pessimism...

449
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:40,303
...to the most abject surrender
to mysticism.

450
00:31:40,505 --> 00:31:43,668
So when, at long last...

451
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:46,708
...the mob came
to burn the place down...

452
00:31:46,911 --> 00:31:49,311
...there was nobody to stop them.

453
00:32:11,202 --> 00:32:14,228
Let me tell you about the end.

454
00:32:14,438 --> 00:32:18,704
It's a story about the last
scientist to work in this place.

455
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:22,141
A mathematician, astronomer,
physicist...

456
00:32:22,346 --> 00:32:27,181
...and head of the school of Neo-
Platonic philosophy in Alexandria.

457
00:32:27,385 --> 00:32:29,615
That's an extraordinary range
of accomplishments...

458
00:32:29,821 --> 00:32:32,415
...for any individual, in any age.

459
00:32:32,623 --> 00:32:35,387
Her name was Hypatia.

460
00:32:35,593 --> 00:32:40,189
She was born in this city
in the year 370 A.D.

461
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:46,431
This was a time when women
had essentially no options.

462
00:32:46,637 --> 00:32:48,969
They were considered property.

463
00:32:49,173 --> 00:32:52,870
Nevertheless, Hypatia was able
to move freely...

464
00:32:53,077 --> 00:32:54,738
...unselfconsciously...

465
00:32:54,946 --> 00:32:58,404
...through traditional male domains.

466
00:32:58,616 --> 00:33:01,915
By all accounts,
she was a great beauty.

467
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:03,746
And although she had many suitors...

468
00:33:03,955 --> 00:33:06,856
...she had no interest in marriage.

469
00:33:08,125 --> 00:33:13,062
The Alexandria of Hypatia's time,
by then long under Roman rule...

470
00:33:13,431 --> 00:33:16,366
...was a city in grave conflict.

471
00:33:16,567 --> 00:33:20,094
Slavery, the cancer
of the ancient world...

472
00:33:20,304 --> 00:33:24,638
...had sapped classical civilization
of its vitality.

473
00:33:24,842 --> 00:33:27,276
The growing Christian Church was...

474
00:33:27,478 --> 00:33:29,378
...consolidating its power...

475
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:34,108
...and attempting to eradicate
pagan influence and culture.

476
00:33:34,318 --> 00:33:38,687
Hypatia stood at the focus...

477
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:43,725
...at the epicenter
of mighty social forces.

478
00:33:43,928 --> 00:33:47,659
Cyril, the Bishop of Alexandria,
despised her...

479
00:33:47,865 --> 00:33:51,995
...in part because of her close
friendship with a Roman governor...

480
00:33:52,203 --> 00:33:56,333
...but also because she was a symbol
of learning and science...

481
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:00,977
...which were largely identified
by the early Church with paganism.

482
00:34:01,979 --> 00:34:03,708
In great personal danger...

483
00:34:03,915 --> 00:34:07,646
...Hypatia continued to teach
and to publish...

484
00:34:07,852 --> 00:34:12,482
...until, in the year 415 A.D.,
on her way to work...

485
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,817
...she was set upon...

486
00:34:15,026 --> 00:34:18,393
...by a fanatical mob of
Cyril's followers.

487
00:34:18,596 --> 00:34:21,258
They dragged her from her chariot...

488
00:34:21,465 --> 00:34:23,092
...tore off her clothes...

489
00:34:23,301 --> 00:34:27,135
...and flayed her flesh
from her bones...

490
00:34:27,338 --> 00:34:29,704
...with abalone shells.

491
00:34:29,907 --> 00:34:33,434
Her remains were burned,
her works obliterated...

492
00:34:33,644 --> 00:34:35,168
...her name forgotten.

493
00:34:35,379 --> 00:34:38,542
Cyril was made a saint.

494
00:34:41,052 --> 00:34:45,011
The glory you see around me...

495
00:34:45,222 --> 00:34:48,055
...is nothing but a memory.

496
00:34:48,259 --> 00:34:49,749
It does not exist.

497
00:34:51,495 --> 00:34:54,464
The last remains of the
library were destroyed...

498
00:34:54,665 --> 00:34:57,190
...within a year of Hypatia's death.

499
00:34:57,401 --> 00:35:01,064
It's as if an entire
civilization had undergone...

500
00:35:01,272 --> 00:35:05,402
...a sort of self-inflicted
radical brain surgery...

501
00:35:05,776 --> 00:35:08,040
...so that most of its memories...

502
00:35:08,245 --> 00:35:11,408
...discoveries, ideas and passions...

503
00:35:11,615 --> 00:35:15,016
...were irrevocably wiped out.

504
00:35:17,555 --> 00:35:20,683
The loss was incalculable.

505
00:35:20,925 --> 00:35:23,223
In some cases, we know only...

506
00:35:23,427 --> 00:35:27,056
...the tantalizing titles of books
that had been destroyed.

507
00:35:27,298 --> 00:35:32,031
In most cases, we know neither
the titles nor the authors.

508
00:35:32,236 --> 00:35:34,670
We do know that in this library...

509
00:35:34,872 --> 00:35:38,899
...there were 123 different
plays by Sophocles...

510
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:42,170
...of which only seven have
survived to our time.

511
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:45,178
One of those seven is Oedipus Rex.

512
00:35:45,383 --> 00:35:48,250
Similar numbers apply
to the lost works of...

513
00:35:48,452 --> 00:35:51,944
...Aeschylus, Euripides, Aristophanes.

514
00:35:52,156 --> 00:35:55,819
It's a little as if the only
surviving works of a man named...

515
00:35:56,027 --> 00:35:57,961
...William Shakespeare...

516
00:35:58,162 --> 00:36:02,121
...were Coriolanus
and A Winter's Tale...

517
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:05,325
...although we knew he had
written some other things...

518
00:36:05,536 --> 00:36:07,629
...which were
highly prized in his time.

519
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:11,296
Plays called Hamlet, Macbeth...

520
00:36:11,509 --> 00:36:15,070
...A Midsummer's Night Dream,
Julius Caesar, King Lear...

521
00:36:15,279 --> 00:36:17,110
...Romeo and Juliet.

522
00:36:24,255 --> 00:36:27,315
History is full of people...

523
00:36:27,525 --> 00:36:31,484
...who, out of fear or ignorance...

524
00:36:31,695 --> 00:36:33,128
...or the lust for power...

525
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:37,289
...have destroyed treasures
of immeasurable value...

526
00:36:37,501 --> 00:36:41,096
...which truly belong to all of us.

527
00:36:41,305 --> 00:36:45,139
We must not let it happen again.

528
00:37:05,996 --> 00:37:08,487
We have considered
the destruction of worlds...

529
00:37:08,699 --> 00:37:11,224
...and the end of civilizations.

530
00:37:11,435 --> 00:37:15,132
But there is another perspective
by which to measure human endeavors.

531
00:37:15,339 --> 00:37:19,036
Let me tell you a story
about the beginning.

532
00:37:19,543 --> 00:37:21,738
Some 15 billion years ago...

533
00:37:21,946 --> 00:37:23,470
...our universe began...

534
00:37:23,681 --> 00:37:27,048
...with the mightiest explosion
of all time.

535
00:37:27,251 --> 00:37:30,812
The universe expanded,
cooled and darkened.

536
00:37:31,021 --> 00:37:34,320
Energy condensed into matter,
mostly hydrogen atoms.

537
00:37:34,525 --> 00:37:37,983
And these atoms accumulated
into vast clouds...

538
00:37:38,195 --> 00:37:39,822
...rushing away from each other...

539
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:43,261
...that would one day become
the galaxies.

540
00:37:44,301 --> 00:37:48,499
Within these galaxies the first
generation of stars was born...

541
00:37:48,706 --> 00:37:51,106
...kindling the energy
hidden in matter...

542
00:37:51,308 --> 00:37:54,038
...flooding the cosmos with light.

543
00:37:54,245 --> 00:37:59,182
Hydrogen atoms had made
suns and starlight.

544
00:38:01,085 --> 00:38:04,680
There were in those times
no planets to receive the light...

545
00:38:04,889 --> 00:38:09,019
...and no living creatures to admire
the radiance of the heavens.

546
00:38:09,226 --> 00:38:11,126
But deep in the stellar furnaces...

547
00:38:11,328 --> 00:38:14,354
...nuclear fusion was creating
the heavier atoms:

548
00:38:14,565 --> 00:38:17,534
Carbon and oxygen,
silicon and iron.

549
00:38:17,735 --> 00:38:20,966
These elements, the ash left
by hydrogen...

550
00:38:21,172 --> 00:38:26,109
...were the raw materials from which
planets and life would later arise.

551
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:30,246
At first, the heavy elements were
trapped in the hearts of the stars.

552
00:38:30,447 --> 00:38:33,541
But massive stars soon
exhausted their fuel...

553
00:38:33,751 --> 00:38:35,241
...and in their death throes...

554
00:38:35,452 --> 00:38:38,478
...returned most of their substance
back into space.

555
00:38:38,689 --> 00:38:43,058
The interstellar gas became
enriched in heavy elements.

556
00:38:44,728 --> 00:38:46,161
In the Milky Way galaxy...

557
00:38:46,363 --> 00:38:50,322
...the matter of the cosmos was recycled
into new generations of stars...

558
00:38:50,534 --> 00:38:52,502
...now rich in heavy atoms.

559
00:38:52,703 --> 00:38:56,400
A legacy from
their stellar ancestors.

560
00:38:58,108 --> 00:39:00,303
And in the cold
of interstellar space...

561
00:39:00,511 --> 00:39:04,003
...great turbulent clouds were
gathered by gravity...

562
00:39:04,215 --> 00:39:07,048
...and stirred by starlight.

563
00:39:10,955 --> 00:39:12,047
In their depths...

564
00:39:12,256 --> 00:39:15,885
...the heavy atoms condensed into
grains of rocky dust and ice...

565
00:39:16,093 --> 00:39:19,153
...and complex
carbon-based molecules.

566
00:39:19,363 --> 00:39:22,423
In accordance with the laws
of physics and chemistry...

567
00:39:22,633 --> 00:39:27,502
...hydrogen atoms had brought forth
the stuff of life.

568
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:38,279
In other clouds, more massive
aggregates of gas and dust...

569
00:39:38,482 --> 00:39:40,950
...formed later generations of stars.

570
00:39:41,151 --> 00:39:42,880
As new stars were formed...

571
00:39:43,087 --> 00:39:46,022
...tiny condensations of matter
accreted near them...

572
00:39:46,223 --> 00:39:49,920
...inconspicuous motes of
rock and metal, ice and gas...

573
00:39:50,127 --> 00:39:51,992
...that would become the planets.

574
00:39:52,196 --> 00:39:55,165
And on these worlds,
as in interstellar clouds...

575
00:39:55,366 --> 00:39:57,197
...organic molecules formed...

576
00:39:57,401 --> 00:40:01,064
...made of atoms that had been
cooked inside the stars.

577
00:40:01,272 --> 00:40:04,332
In the tide pools and oceans
of many worlds...

578
00:40:04,541 --> 00:40:08,807
...molecules were destroyed by
sunlight and assembled by chemistry.

579
00:40:09,013 --> 00:40:12,176
One day, among these
natural experiments...

580
00:40:12,383 --> 00:40:15,181
...a molecule arose, that,
quite by accident...

581
00:40:15,386 --> 00:40:18,446
...was able to make crude copies
of itself.

582
00:40:24,061 --> 00:40:27,519
As time passed, self-replication
became more accurate.

583
00:40:27,731 --> 00:40:29,528
Those molecules that copied better...

584
00:40:29,733 --> 00:40:31,291
...produced more copies.

585
00:40:31,502 --> 00:40:33,993
Natural selection was underway.

586
00:40:34,204 --> 00:40:37,230
Elaborate molecular machines
had evolved.

587
00:40:37,441 --> 00:40:41,707
Slowly, imperceptibly, life had begun.

588
00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:52,885
Collectives of organic molecules
evolved into one-celled organisms.

589
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:55,615
These produced multi-celled colonies.

590
00:40:55,826 --> 00:40:59,193
Their various parts became
specialized organs.

591
00:40:59,396 --> 00:41:02,797
Some colonies attached themselves
to the sea floor...

592
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,798
...others swam freely.

593
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:10,030
Eyes evolved, and now the cosmos
could see.

594
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,403
Living things moved on
to colonize the land.

595
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:16,238
The reptiles held sway for a time...

596
00:41:16,447 --> 00:41:20,474
...but gave way to small warm-blooded
creatures with bigger brains...

597
00:41:20,684 --> 00:41:24,814
...who developed dexterity and
curiosity about their environment.

598
00:41:25,022 --> 00:41:28,389
They learned to use tools and
fire and language.

599
00:41:28,592 --> 00:41:31,288
Star stuff,
the ash of stellar alchemy...

600
00:41:31,495 --> 00:41:34,430
...had emerged into consciousness.

601
00:41:45,008 --> 00:41:49,308
We are a way for the cosmos
to know itself.

602
00:41:49,513 --> 00:41:51,504
We are creatures of the cosmos...

603
00:41:51,715 --> 00:41:55,014
...and have always hungered
to know our origins...

604
00:41:55,219 --> 00:41:58,848
...to understand our connection
with the universe.

605
00:41:59,056 --> 00:42:01,581
How did everything come to be?

606
00:42:03,193 --> 00:42:06,094
Every culture on the planet
has devised its own response...

607
00:42:06,296 --> 00:42:09,265
...to the riddle
posed by the universe.

608
00:42:13,337 --> 00:42:17,967
Every culture celebrates
the cycles of life and nature.

609
00:42:19,576 --> 00:42:22,010
There are many different ways
of being human.

610
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:28,275
But an extraterrestrial visitor...

611
00:42:28,485 --> 00:42:31,249
...examining the differences
among human societies...

612
00:42:31,455 --> 00:42:33,889
...would find those
differences trivial...

613
00:42:34,091 --> 00:42:36,423
...compared to the similarities.

614
00:42:44,067 --> 00:42:46,968
We are one species.

615
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:10,285
We are star stuff,
harvesting starlight.

616
00:43:10,694 --> 00:43:13,629
Our lives, our past and our future...

617
00:43:13,831 --> 00:43:18,325
...are tied to the sun, the moon
and the stars.

618
00:43:21,805 --> 00:43:24,865
Our ancestors knew that
their survival depended...

619
00:43:25,075 --> 00:43:26,770
...on understanding the heavens.

620
00:43:26,977 --> 00:43:29,571
They built observatories
and computers...

621
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:34,308
...to predict the changing of the
seasons by the motions in the skies.

622
00:43:34,518 --> 00:43:36,679
We are, all of us...

623
00:43:36,887 --> 00:43:40,084
...descended from astronomers.

624
00:43:42,259 --> 00:43:44,454
The discovery of order
in the universe...

625
00:43:44,661 --> 00:43:46,151
...of the laws of nature...

626
00:43:46,363 --> 00:43:50,527
...is the foundation on which
science builds today.

627
00:43:57,641 --> 00:43:59,233
Our conception of the cosmos...

628
00:43:59,443 --> 00:44:01,468
...all of modern science
and technology...

629
00:44:01,678 --> 00:44:05,671
...trace back to questions
raised by the stars.

630
00:44:07,317 --> 00:44:09,478
Yet, even 400 years ago...

631
00:44:09,686 --> 00:44:12,519
...we still had no idea
of our place in the universe.

632
00:44:12,723 --> 00:44:15,089
The long journey to
that understanding...

633
00:44:15,292 --> 00:44:18,125
...required both an unflinching
respect for the facts...

634
00:44:18,328 --> 00:44:21,092
...and a delight
in the natural world.

635
00:44:23,867 --> 00:44:25,801

00:44:26,003 --> 00:44:29,803
"We do not ask for what useful
purpose the birds do sing...

637
00:44:30,007 --> 00:44:34,068
...for song is their pleasure
since they were created for singing.

638
00:44:34,411 --> 00:44:35,435
Similarly...

639
00:44:35,646 --> 00:44:38,615
...we ought not to ask why the
human mind troubles to fathom...

640
00:44:38,815 --> 00:44:40,305
...the secrets of the heavens.

641
00:44:40,517 --> 00:44:43,748
The diversity of the phenomena
of nature is so great...

642
00:44:43,954 --> 00:44:47,219
...and the treasures hidden
in the heavens so rich...

643
00:44:47,424 --> 00:44:48,857
...precisely in order...

644
00:44:49,059 --> 00:44:53,257
...that the human mind shall never
be lacking in fresh nourishment."

645
00:45:34,738 --> 00:45:36,865
It is the birthright
of every child...

646
00:45:37,074 --> 00:45:39,372
...to encounter the cosmos anew...

647
00:45:39,576 --> 00:45:42,204
...in every culture and every age.

648
00:45:44,715 --> 00:45:49,345
When this happens to us,
we experience a deep sense of wonder.

649
00:45:49,553 --> 00:45:52,420
The most fortunate among
us are guided by teachers...

650
00:45:52,623 --> 00:45:55,524
...who channel this exhilaration.

651
00:45:57,995 --> 00:46:00,520
We are born
to delight in the world.

652
00:46:00,731 --> 00:46:05,134
We are taught to distinguish
our preconceptions from the truth.

653
00:46:05,335 --> 00:46:08,395
Then, new worlds are discovered...

654
00:46:08,605 --> 00:46:12,507
...as we decipher the mysteries
of the cosmos.

655
00:46:30,127 --> 00:46:32,595
Science is a collective enterprise...

656
00:46:32,796 --> 00:46:36,562
...that embraces many cultures
and spans the generations.

657
00:46:36,767 --> 00:46:40,498
In every age, and sometimes
in the most unlikely places...

658
00:46:40,704 --> 00:46:43,366
...there are those who wish
with a great passion...

659
00:46:43,573 --> 00:46:45,370
...to understand the world.

660
00:46:45,575 --> 00:46:48,567
We don't know where
the next discovery will come from.

661
00:46:48,779 --> 00:46:53,443
What dream of the mind's eye
will remake the world.

662
00:46:59,156 --> 00:47:03,354
These dreams begin
as impossibilities.

663
00:47:06,296 --> 00:47:10,790
Once, even to see a planet through
a telescope was an astonishment.

664
00:47:11,001 --> 00:47:12,559
But we studied these worlds...

665
00:47:12,769 --> 00:47:15,431
...we figured out how
they moved in their orbits...

666
00:47:15,639 --> 00:47:18,506
...and soon we were planning
voyages of discovery...

667
00:47:18,709 --> 00:47:20,142
...beyond the Earth...

668
00:47:20,343 --> 00:47:24,837
...and sending robot explorers
to the planets and the stars.

669
00:47:39,663 --> 00:47:43,793
We humans long to be connected
with our origins...

670
00:47:44,768 --> 00:47:47,236
...so we create rituals.

671
00:47:48,405 --> 00:47:50,999
Science is another way
to express this longing.

672
00:47:51,208 --> 00:47:53,472
It also connects us
with our origins.

673
00:47:53,677 --> 00:47:58,046
And it, too, has its rituals
and its commandments.

674
00:48:06,957 --> 00:48:11,587
Its only sacred truth is that
there are no sacred truths.

675
00:48:14,598 --> 00:48:16,498
Temperature systems...

676
00:48:16,867 --> 00:48:19,392
SAGAN: All assumptions must
be critically examined.

677
00:48:19,603 --> 00:48:22,868
Arguments from authority
are worthless.

678
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:28,976
FEMALE SCIENTIST:
Transducer power is on.

679
00:48:34,584 --> 00:48:36,643
SAGAN: Whatever is inconsistent
with the facts...

680
00:48:36,853 --> 00:48:38,946
...no matter how
fond of it we are...

681
00:48:39,156 --> 00:48:42,319
...must be discarded or revised.

682
00:48:50,834 --> 00:48:53,064
Science is not perfect.

683
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:54,828
It's often misused.

684
00:48:55,038 --> 00:48:56,903
It's only a tool.

685
00:48:57,174 --> 00:48:58,869
But it's the best tool we have...

686
00:48:59,075 --> 00:49:01,805
...self-correcting, ever-changing...

687
00:49:02,012 --> 00:49:04,503
...applicable to everything.

688
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:14,880
With this tool,
we vanquish the impossible.

689
00:49:40,483 --> 00:49:42,144
With the methods of science...

690
00:49:42,352 --> 00:49:45,788
...we have begun
to explore the cosmos.

691
00:49:48,425 --> 00:49:51,053
For the first time,
scientific discoveries...

692
00:49:51,261 --> 00:49:53,593
...are widely accessible.

693
00:49:56,967 --> 00:49:58,434
Our machines...

694
00:49:58,635 --> 00:50:00,125
...the products of science...

695
00:50:00,337 --> 00:50:02,805
...are now beyond
the orbit of Saturn.

696
00:50:09,412 --> 00:50:11,972
A preliminary spacecraft
reconnaissance...

697
00:50:12,182 --> 00:50:15,174
...has been made of 20 new worlds.

698
00:50:15,852 --> 00:50:18,912
We have learned to value
careful observations...

699
00:50:19,122 --> 00:50:22,023
...to respect the facts, even
when they are disquieting...

700
00:50:22,225 --> 00:50:25,217
...when they seem to contradict
conventional wisdom.

701
00:50:26,229 --> 00:50:30,598
The Canterbury monks faithfully
recorded an impact on the moon...

702
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,964
...and the Anasazi people,
an explosion of a distant star.

703
00:50:35,171 --> 00:50:38,436
They saw for us as we see for them.

704
00:50:38,642 --> 00:50:42,100
We see further than they only because
we stand on their shoulders.

705
00:50:42,312 --> 00:50:43,904
We build on what they knew.

706
00:50:44,114 --> 00:50:46,309
We depend on free inquiry...

707
00:50:46,516 --> 00:50:49,041
...and free access to knowledge.

708
00:50:49,286 --> 00:50:52,778
We humans have seen the atoms
which constitute all of matter...

709
00:50:52,989 --> 00:50:56,789
...and the forces that sculpt
this world and others.

710
00:51:01,932 --> 00:51:03,763
We know
the molecules of life...

711
00:51:03,967 --> 00:51:06,800
...are easily formed
under conditions common...

712
00:51:07,003 --> 00:51:09,699
...throughout the cosmos.

713
00:51:09,906 --> 00:51:13,398
We have mapped the molecular machines
at the heart of life.

714
00:51:15,211 --> 00:51:18,703
We have discovered a microcosm
in a drop of water.

715
00:51:18,949 --> 00:51:20,746
We have peered
into the bloodstream...

716
00:51:20,951 --> 00:51:23,010
...and down on our stormy planet...

717
00:51:23,219 --> 00:51:26,313
...to see the Earth
as a single organism.

718
00:51:26,523 --> 00:51:28,650
We have found volcanoes
on other worlds...

719
00:51:28,858 --> 00:51:30,826
...and explosions on the sun...

720
00:51:31,027 --> 00:51:33,461
...studied comets from
the depths of space...

721
00:51:33,663 --> 00:51:37,224
...and traced their origins
and destinies...

722
00:51:37,434 --> 00:51:39,197
...listened to pulsars...

723
00:51:39,402 --> 00:51:42,337
...and searched for
other civilizations.

724
00:51:44,207 --> 00:51:47,608
We humans have set foot
on another world...

725
00:51:47,811 --> 00:51:50,405
...in a place called
the Sea of Tranquility...

726
00:51:50,613 --> 00:51:53,912
...an astonishing achievement
for creatures such as we...

727
00:51:54,117 --> 00:51:57,712
...whose earliest footsteps,
3 ? million years old...

728
00:51:57,921 --> 00:52:02,415
...are preserved in the volcanic
ash of East Africa.

729
00:52:02,625 --> 00:52:05,116
We have walked far.

730
00:53:35,618 --> 00:53:38,712
These are some of the things
that hydrogen atoms do...

731
00:53:38,922 --> 00:53:43,518
...given 15 billion years
of cosmic evolution.

732
00:53:45,562 --> 00:53:48,690
It has the sound of epic myth.

733
00:53:48,898 --> 00:53:50,331
But it's simply a description...

734
00:53:50,533 --> 00:53:52,194
...of the evolution of the cosmos...

735
00:53:52,402 --> 00:53:55,860
...as revealed by science in our time.

736
00:53:56,072 --> 00:53:57,334
And we...

737
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:00,998
...we who embody the local
eyes and ears...

738
00:54:01,211 --> 00:54:03,509
...and thoughts and feelings
of the cosmos...

739
00:54:03,713 --> 00:54:07,843
...we've begun, at last, to wonder
about our origins.

740
00:54:08,051 --> 00:54:11,418
Star stuff, contemplating the stars...

741
00:54:11,621 --> 00:54:16,217
...organized collections of 10 billion-
billion-billion atoms...

742
00:54:16,426 --> 00:54:18,485
...contemplating the evolution
of matter...

743
00:54:18,695 --> 00:54:23,223
...tracing that long path by which
it arrived at consciousness...

744
00:54:23,433 --> 00:54:25,094
...here on the planet Earth...

745
00:54:25,301 --> 00:54:28,099
...and perhaps, throughout the cosmos.

746
00:54:28,771 --> 00:54:33,708
Our loyalties are to the species
and the planet.

747
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:36,003
We speak for Earth.

748
00:54:36,212 --> 00:54:38,703
Our obligation to survive
and flourish...

749
00:54:38,915 --> 00:54:41,577
...is owed not just to ourselves...

750
00:54:41,784 --> 00:54:46,050
...but also to that cosmos,
ancient and vast...

751
00:54:46,256 --> 00:54:48,053
...from which we spring.

752
00:55:28,698 --> 00:55:32,225
The greatest thrill for me
in reliving this adventure...

753
00:55:32,435 --> 00:55:36,496
...has been not just
that we've completed...

754
00:55:36,706 --> 00:55:39,436
...the preliminary reconnaissance
with spacecraft...

755
00:55:39,642 --> 00:55:42,167
...of the entire solar system.

756
00:55:42,378 --> 00:55:44,403
And not just that we've discovered...

757
00:55:44,614 --> 00:55:48,516
...astonishing structures in
the realm of the galaxies...

758
00:55:48,718 --> 00:55:50,185
...but especially...

759
00:55:50,386 --> 00:55:55,119
...that some of Cosmos' boldest
dreams about this world...

760
00:55:55,325 --> 00:55:57,486
...are coming closer to reality.

761
00:55:57,694 --> 00:56:00,720
Since this series' maiden voyage...

762
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:02,898
...the impossible has come to pass.

763
00:56:03,099 --> 00:56:08,036
Mighty walls that maintained
insuperable ideological differences...

764
00:56:08,338 --> 00:56:10,636
...have come tumbling down.

765
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:15,334
Deadly enemies have embraced
and begun to work together.

766
00:56:15,545 --> 00:56:18,013
The imperative to cherish
the Earth...

767
00:56:18,214 --> 00:56:22,173
...and to protect the global
environment that sustains all of us...

768
00:56:22,385 --> 00:56:24,853
...has become widely accepted.

769
00:56:25,054 --> 00:56:27,181
And we've begun, finally...

770
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:28,687
...the process of reducing...

771
00:56:28,891 --> 00:56:32,759
...the obscene number of weapons
of mass destruction.

772
00:56:32,962 --> 00:56:35,760
Perhaps we have, after all...

773
00:56:35,965 --> 00:56:39,059
...decided to choose life.

774
00:56:40,637 --> 00:56:43,834
But we still have light-years
to go to ensure that choice...

775
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:48,977
...even after the summits and
the ceremonies and the treaties.

776
00:56:49,178 --> 00:56:54,115
There are still some 50,000
nuclear weapons in the world.

777
00:56:54,450 --> 00:56:58,318
And it would require the detonation
of only a tiny fraction of them...

778
00:56:58,521 --> 00:57:00,989
...to produce a nuclear winter...

779
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:04,159
...the predicted global
climatic catastrophe...

780
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:08,296
...that would result from the smoke
and dust lifted into the atmosphere...

781
00:57:08,498 --> 00:57:12,764
...by burning cities
and petroleum facilities.

782
00:57:12,969 --> 00:57:16,905
The world's scientific community has
begun to sound the alarm...

783
00:57:17,106 --> 00:57:19,370
...about the grave dangers
posed by...

784
00:57:19,575 --> 00:57:22,009
...depleting the protective
ozone shield...

785
00:57:22,211 --> 00:57:24,338
...and by greenhouse warming.

786
00:57:24,547 --> 00:57:28,005
And again, we're taking some
mitigating steps.

787
00:57:28,217 --> 00:57:31,744
But again,
those steps are too small...

788
00:57:31,954 --> 00:57:34,445
...and too slow.

789
00:57:34,757 --> 00:57:38,386
The discovery that such a thing as
nuclear winter was really possible...

790
00:57:38,594 --> 00:57:41,893
...evolved out of studies
of Martian dust storms.

791
00:57:42,098 --> 00:57:45,864
The surface of Mars,
fried by ultraviolet light...

792
00:57:46,069 --> 00:57:48,333
...is also a reminder
of why it's important...

793
00:57:48,538 --> 00:57:51,336
...to keep our ozone layer intact.

794
00:57:51,541 --> 00:57:54,203
The runaway greenhouse effect
on Venus...

795
00:57:54,410 --> 00:57:55,934
...is a valuable reminder...

796
00:57:56,145 --> 00:58:00,639
...that we must take the increasing
greenhouse effect on Earth seriously.

797
00:58:00,850 --> 00:58:04,684
Important lessons about
our environment...

798
00:58:04,887 --> 00:58:08,220
...have come from spacecraft missions
to the planets.

799
00:58:08,424 --> 00:58:10,289
By exploring other worlds...

800
00:58:10,493 --> 00:58:12,461
...we safeguard this one.

801
00:58:12,662 --> 00:58:14,892
By itself, this fact
more than justifies...

802
00:58:15,098 --> 00:58:17,032
...the money our species has spent...

803
00:58:17,233 --> 00:58:20,999
...in sending ships to other worlds.

804
00:58:21,604 --> 00:58:24,095
It is our fate...

805
00:58:24,307 --> 00:58:27,105
...to live during one of
the most perilous...

806
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:29,073
...and one of the most hopeful...

807
00:58:29,278 --> 00:58:31,246
...chapters in human history.

808
00:58:31,447 --> 00:58:34,143
Our science and our technology...

809
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:35,874
...have posed us...

810
00:58:36,085 --> 00:58:38,315
...a profound question:

811
00:58:38,521 --> 00:58:42,013
Will we learn to use these tools...

812
00:58:42,225 --> 00:58:46,594
...with wisdom and foresight
before it's too late?

813
00:58:46,796 --> 00:58:50,732
Will we see our species safely
through this difficult passage...

814
00:58:50,933 --> 00:58:55,063
...so that our children and
grandchildren will continue...

815
00:58:55,271 --> 00:58:58,866
...the great journey of discovery
still deeper...

816
00:58:59,075 --> 00:59:03,569
...into the mysteries of the cosmos?

817
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:08,547
That same rocket and nuclear
and computer technology...

818
00:59:08,751 --> 00:59:13,654
...that sends our ships past
the farthest known planet...

819
00:59:13,856 --> 00:59:17,986
...can also be used to destroy
our global civilization.

820
00:59:18,194 --> 00:59:20,754
Exactly the same technology...

821
00:59:20,963 --> 00:59:22,863
...can be used for good...

822
00:59:23,065 --> 00:59:24,623
...and for evil.

823
00:59:24,834 --> 00:59:27,428
It is as if...

824
00:59:27,637 --> 00:59:29,264
...there were a god...

825
00:59:29,472 --> 00:59:31,337
...who said to us:

826
00:59:31,541 --> 00:59:34,942
"I set before you two ways.

827
00:59:35,144 --> 00:59:38,705
You can use your technology
to destroy yourselves...

828
00:59:38,915 --> 00:59:43,852
...or to carry you to the planets
and the stars.

829
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,712
It's up to you."
