21
00:02:41,418 --> 00:02:43,443
- Pull the rope.
- This one?

22
00:02:49,526 --> 00:02:52,893
- Arkhip, give me the strap.
- Hold it.

23
00:02:56,866 --> 00:02:57,992
Take it.

24
00:03:00,103 --> 00:03:01,092
Look!

25
00:03:02,072 --> 00:03:03,232
It's Yefim, isn't it?

26
00:03:25,261 --> 00:03:27,491
- Come here and help.
- Pull the rope.

27
00:03:27,564 --> 00:03:29,964
- Hold on a second.
- Come on, quick!

28
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,799
Where is it?

29
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,668
- Where is it?
- Here.

30
00:03:40,377 --> 00:03:41,571
Come on, fast.

31
00:03:44,714 --> 00:03:47,342
Lift it.

32
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,498
Lord. Let it go right.

33
00:04:14,677 --> 00:04:16,668
Untie it now.

34
00:04:16,813 --> 00:04:18,440
The rope is tangled.

35
00:04:18,515 --> 00:04:21,177
Hold it!

36
00:04:21,284 --> 00:04:23,013
We won't have enough time.

37
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,184
I'm ready!

38
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,350
Archipushka! You try to hold them!

39
00:04:30,427 --> 00:04:32,918
Just a second.

40
00:04:34,964 --> 00:04:36,989
Come on!

41
00:04:37,066 --> 00:04:38,966
Hold him, hold him!

42
00:04:51,448 --> 00:04:54,315
I'm here. I'm here.

43
00:05:00,356 --> 00:05:01,721
Cut the rope, man!

44
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:05,750
Cut the rope!

45
00:05:05,829 --> 00:05:08,923
I'll show you, cut the rope!

46
00:05:27,951 --> 00:05:31,409
My God!

47
00:05:32,188 --> 00:05:34,554
Yefim!

48
00:05:34,624 --> 00:05:38,219
- Where are you going?
- Archipushka!

49
00:05:38,595 --> 00:05:43,396
I'm flying! I'm flying!

50
00:06:08,224 --> 00:06:13,662
Hey! Chase me! Chase me!

51
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,662
My God! What is it?

52
00:07:12,221 --> 00:07:15,349
Archipushka!

53
00:08:14,984 --> 00:08:21,048
THE JESTER
Summer 1400

54
00:08:34,771 --> 00:08:36,568
Danil!

55
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:41,074
Danil!

56
00:08:43,079 --> 00:08:45,604
Danil! The Father
told you to go back!

57
00:08:47,283 --> 00:08:49,843
There is no one to paint the icons.

58
00:08:50,153 --> 00:08:51,347
For God's sake!

59
00:08:51,421 --> 00:08:53,753
It's no business of yours.

60
00:08:53,823 --> 00:08:57,224
You will be sorry for that. You
will come begging on your knees.

61
00:08:57,293 --> 00:08:58,760
But the Father will not forgive you.

62
00:08:58,828 --> 00:09:01,319
Come on. You never know.

63
00:09:01,397 --> 00:09:03,797
We shall see.

64
00:09:08,838 --> 00:09:10,829
It's not good.

65
00:09:10,907 --> 00:09:11,931
What?

66
00:09:12,341 --> 00:09:14,605
That we are leaving Troitsa.

67
00:09:23,886 --> 00:09:25,945
It's a shame.

68
00:09:27,957 --> 00:09:32,087
Aren't there enough painters
in Moscow without us, Danil?

69
00:09:32,995 --> 00:09:35,657
We'll find some sort of work.

70
00:09:35,732 --> 00:09:38,633
All this is right, but it's a pity that...

71
00:09:39,569 --> 00:09:43,130
I passed this birch every
day and never noticed it.

72
00:09:43,272 --> 00:09:47,470
When you know you'll never
see it again, it means something.

73
00:09:48,044 --> 00:09:52,378
It's been ten years. Nine
for you, but ten for me.

74
00:09:52,615 --> 00:09:54,674
No, seven for me, nine for you.

75
00:09:56,085 --> 00:09:58,451
- It's raining.
- Come on here.

76
00:09:58,554 --> 00:10:00,522
Let's go. We will not melt.

77
00:10:38,227 --> 00:10:41,719
<i>The jesters were walking.</i>
<i>Drunk on mead and beer...</i>

78
00:10:41,931 --> 00:10:46,129
<i>...when they met their</i>
<i>master, the Boyar...</i>

79
00:10:46,302 --> 00:10:48,463
<i>...and they sang, to greet him:</i>

80
00:10:48,805 --> 00:10:52,297
<i>O master. O Boyar...</i>

81
00:10:52,408 --> 00:10:56,208
<i>...everything is ready in the kitchen!</i>

82
00:10:56,479 --> 00:11:02,042
<i>The Boyar's plump</i>
<i>wife is a choosy trollop.</i>

83
00:11:03,619 --> 00:11:07,578
Mistress, open the door.
The master's coming!

84
00:11:08,257 --> 00:11:12,853
<i>The Boyar yells: "Jesters are
<i>all thieves and drunkards!

85
00:11:13,863 --> 00:11:17,196
<i>"You should be whipped
<i>from Friday to Friday!"

86
00:11:17,433 --> 00:11:21,392
"You goats and tramps,
drown in your beer!

87
00:11:21,771 --> 00:11:24,501
"Soon you will be impaled!"

88
00:11:24,874 --> 00:11:29,072
The Jesters grabbed him
between his navel and his knees.

89
00:11:32,648 --> 00:11:37,244
<i>They shaved his beard; what's
<i>a Boyar without his beard?

90
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,581
<i>Any woman would
<i>rather he had a beard.

91
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:46,353
<i>The Boyar yells,
<i>hops about like a flea.

92
00:11:46,729 --> 00:11:50,665
<i>He scurries home,
<i>raps on the window.

93
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:58,898
<i>But his wife doesn't
<i>recognize his naked cheeks...

94
00:12:00,643 --> 00:12:04,044
<i>...with no beard to grab hold of.

95
00:12:04,313 --> 00:12:07,680
<i>She whacked him with a rolling pin.

96
00:12:09,085 --> 00:12:10,882
What a disgrace!

97
00:12:12,922 --> 00:12:16,414
<i>"Cover your naked cheeks
<i>with your breeches.

98
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,689
<i>"Clear off, beardless Boyar!"

99
00:12:21,564 --> 00:12:25,591
<i>He hobbled off, pursued by geese...

100
00:12:25,801 --> 00:12:28,531
<i>...and met a priest...

101
00:12:28,871 --> 00:12:34,434
<i>...who mistook him for a woman and
<i>dragged him into the bushes.

102
00:12:36,979 --> 00:12:40,005
<i>Without breeches...

103
00:12:40,349 --> 00:12:44,410
<i>...he looks the same at each end.

104
00:13:13,549 --> 00:13:16,643
<i>The woman saw a naked head...

105
00:13:17,153 --> 00:13:20,520
<i>...and grabbed it by the beard.

106
00:13:32,101 --> 00:13:35,867
May we shelter from the storm?

107
00:13:36,605 --> 00:13:38,334
Come in.

108
00:13:44,613 --> 00:13:47,844
Do you want some beer?
You are soaking wet.

109
00:13:47,917 --> 00:13:49,544
Thank you, we don't imbibe.

110
00:13:49,885 --> 00:13:51,375
And don't play around with women.

111
00:15:49,605 --> 00:15:52,574
God sent priests, but
the devil sent jesters.

112
00:16:33,616 --> 00:16:35,208
<i>The woman saw a head!

113
00:16:37,286 --> 00:16:38,810
<i>By the beard!

114
00:16:55,204 --> 00:16:59,004
My woman might have
been playing in the bushes.

115
00:17:05,147 --> 00:17:06,614
I'll show you!

116
00:18:22,691 --> 00:18:25,023
Come here, you.

117
00:18:54,857 --> 00:18:56,085
What are you doing?

118
00:19:31,126 --> 00:19:32,423
Give it back to him.

119
00:19:51,046 --> 00:19:52,741
Where were you, Kirill?

120
00:19:52,981 --> 00:19:55,575
Outside. Shall we go?

121
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:10,223
Danil, the rain's stopped; let's go.

122
00:20:39,862 --> 00:20:41,693
Christ be with you, mistress.

123
00:21:39,154 --> 00:21:45,992
THEOPHANES THE GREEK
Summer-Winter-Spring-Summer
1405-1406

124
00:21:55,404 --> 00:21:58,305
I'm innocent!

125
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:08,874
Let me go!

126
00:22:43,552 --> 00:22:45,543
Is anyone in here?

127
00:23:22,491 --> 00:23:24,220
Have you come to look?

128
00:23:25,894 --> 00:23:26,883
Yes, to look.

129
00:23:34,202 --> 00:23:37,797
Then look. We'll soon be finished.

130
00:23:40,475 --> 00:23:43,876
So you are Theophanes the Greek?

131
00:23:47,849 --> 00:23:50,818
Why look at me? Look there.

132
00:23:52,454 --> 00:23:54,183
Where are you from?

133
00:23:54,556 --> 00:23:56,820
From Andronnikov Monastery.

134
00:23:57,326 --> 00:24:00,454
From Andronnikov Monastery?
Are you by chance Andrei Rublev?

135
00:24:03,532 --> 00:24:04,624
No.

136
00:24:05,701 --> 00:24:09,137
I've heard everyone
praise this Rublev.

137
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,501
He's good, but not as good as this.

138
00:24:19,681 --> 00:24:21,911
Such delicate colors.

139
00:24:26,521 --> 00:24:28,352
Oh Lord, it's just...

140
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:42,068
Why did you stop
praising me? Go on.

141
00:24:42,137 --> 00:24:45,573
I can't. I can't find the right words.

142
00:24:45,774 --> 00:24:49,904
Konstantin Kostechevsky
was right when he said:

143
00:24:50,178 --> 00:24:52,703
"Only with true insight...

144
00:24:52,781 --> 00:24:55,249
" ...can you grasp its essence."

145
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:02,115
Whereas Andrei... and
I'll tell him to his face...

146
00:25:03,792 --> 00:25:06,693
He's like my brother.

147
00:25:07,162 --> 00:25:13,567
He's praised, it's true:
he paints well. With subtlety.

148
00:25:15,971 --> 00:25:19,805
But there's something
lacking in all his work.

149
00:25:24,112 --> 00:25:27,411
There's no awe, no faith...

150
00:25:28,116 --> 00:25:31,210
...no faith that comes from
the depths of his soul.

151
00:25:32,754 --> 00:25:34,415
No simplicity.

152
00:25:35,457 --> 00:25:41,453
As Epiphanius said in
"The Life of Saint Sergeius":

153
00:25:42,097 --> 00:25:44,190
"Simplicity, without gaudiness."

154
00:25:46,301 --> 00:25:49,930
That is what this is. It's sacred.

155
00:25:50,405 --> 00:25:55,399
Simplicity, without gaudiness...
you can't say it better.

156
00:25:55,477 --> 00:25:57,308
I see you are a wise man.

157
00:25:57,746 --> 00:26:00,010
If so, is that a good thing?

158
00:26:00,115 --> 00:26:05,451
If one is ignorant, isn't it better
to be guided by one's heart?

159
00:26:06,088 --> 00:26:09,114
In much wisdom
there is much grief...

160
00:26:09,858 --> 00:26:13,954
...and he who increases
knowledge increases sorrow.

161
00:26:20,502 --> 00:26:23,835
Proshka! Where is that oil?

162
00:26:24,206 --> 00:26:26,265
Whose ears should I box?

163
00:26:27,576 --> 00:26:29,703
It is as though the earth
has swallowed everyone.

164
00:26:29,778 --> 00:26:31,268
They say you paint quickly.

165
00:26:31,346 --> 00:26:34,577
I cannot work any
other way. I get bored.

166
00:26:35,183 --> 00:26:37,777
I wasted a week on an icon once.

167
00:26:37,953 --> 00:26:39,147
You threw it away?

168
00:26:39,888 --> 00:26:43,346
No. I used the board
to press cabbage.

169
00:26:43,658 --> 00:26:46,627
It's all so boring.

170
00:26:47,129 --> 00:26:49,620
I have pupils and
assistants in abundance...

171
00:26:49,698 --> 00:26:50,892
...but none of them is any good.

172
00:26:50,966 --> 00:26:53,366
They can neither read nor write.

173
00:26:55,904 --> 00:26:59,135
Listen, help me. Be my assistant.

174
00:27:01,543 --> 00:27:03,602
Don't make fun of me.

175
00:27:03,678 --> 00:27:05,543
I'm not making fun of you.

176
00:27:05,714 --> 00:27:10,515
In spring, I must paint the Church
of the Annunciation in Moscow...

177
00:27:10,585 --> 00:27:12,177
...and I have no
assistants to do it with.

178
00:27:12,254 --> 00:27:14,518
The scaffolding is being built.

179
00:27:14,689 --> 00:27:17,021
- Do you understand?
- I do understand.

180
00:27:17,092 --> 00:27:18,491
But I wouldn't be able to cope.

181
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:23,361
I'll teach you. You never
prepared a wall for a fresco?

182
00:27:23,665 --> 00:27:28,466
You've a brain; even these
idiots can prepare a wall.

183
00:27:29,771 --> 00:27:31,898
I said no and I mean no.

184
00:27:32,641 --> 00:27:33,972
You know best...

185
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:39,372
...but mind you don't
regret it; I am rancorous.

186
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:42,515
I may regret it, but it's a sin for you.

187
00:27:42,784 --> 00:27:46,015
An unknown monk comes to you...

188
00:27:46,688 --> 00:27:49,179
...and you like the fact that you
can talk about books with him...

189
00:27:49,257 --> 00:27:50,986
...and you decide to
take him and favor him.

190
00:27:52,227 --> 00:27:56,926
But I haven't looked at a book for
three years and I don't want to.

191
00:27:57,232 --> 00:28:00,201
- Why?
- I have a different road.

192
00:28:00,969 --> 00:28:04,132
Wicked bastards!

193
00:28:04,472 --> 00:28:06,463
Where is Proshka? Where is Vikenty?

194
00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:10,068
They ran to the square to see how
they were going to kill the ruler.

195
00:28:10,145 --> 00:28:13,410
Wicked bastards!

196
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:25,354
See?

197
00:28:26,061 --> 00:28:28,655
And you don't want to help?

198
00:28:39,507 --> 00:28:42,271
- I shall die soon.
- You shouldn't say that.

199
00:28:42,844 --> 00:28:47,474
The other night I
dreamed of an angel.

200
00:28:47,849 --> 00:28:50,283
He said: "Come with me."

201
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:54,418
I said: " I shall die soon, without you."

202
00:29:08,904 --> 00:29:10,963
You won't change
your mind, will you?

203
00:29:13,341 --> 00:29:17,243
Only on one condition.

204
00:29:17,746 --> 00:29:20,806
Whatever you want.
Money? Half my fee, okay?

205
00:29:21,416 --> 00:29:26,080
No. I'll work for nothing
if you yourself...

206
00:29:28,189 --> 00:29:31,386
...come to Andronnikov
Monastery to fetch me.

207
00:29:32,093 --> 00:29:37,326
Before the community, the
metropolitan, ask me to help you...

208
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,566
...before the brotherhood,
before Andrei Rublev.

209
00:29:43,338 --> 00:29:45,966
Then I shall serve you like a slave...

210
00:29:46,574 --> 00:29:50,010
...like a dog, until the day I die.

211
00:29:50,378 --> 00:29:52,710
What is your name?

212
00:29:53,214 --> 00:29:54,442
Kirill.

213
00:30:02,958 --> 00:30:06,519
<i>Orthodox Christians, lovers of truth.

214
00:30:06,995 --> 00:30:11,932
<i>How long will this torture go
<i>on, when will you end this?

215
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,159
<i>You are thoughtless
<i>sinners, yet you judge.

216
00:30:16,938 --> 00:30:20,931
<i>You faithless heathens!

217
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:24,010
<i>He has already seven
<i>times atoned for his sins...

218
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:25,239
<i>...for both his sins and yours.

219
00:30:25,313 --> 00:30:28,305
<i>You are incredible
<i>sinners yourselves.

220
00:30:28,383 --> 00:30:30,180
<i>And you judge...

221
00:30:30,251 --> 00:30:32,776
<i>...but you don't have God with you.

222
00:31:11,092 --> 00:31:14,289
<i>Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth...

223
00:31:14,629 --> 00:31:19,225
<i>...and let thy heart cheer thee
<i>in the days of thy youth.

224
00:31:19,601 --> 00:31:23,503
<i>Walk in the ways of thine heart,
<i>and in the sight of thine eyes...

225
00:31:23,671 --> 00:31:26,936
<i>...but know that for all these...

226
00:31:27,175 --> 00:31:30,201
<i>...God will bring thee into judgment.

227
00:31:41,356 --> 00:31:44,257
<i>Remember now thy Creator
<i>in the days of thy youth...

228
00:31:44,325 --> 00:31:45,917
<i>...before the difficult days come...

229
00:31:46,194 --> 00:31:49,322
<i>...and the years draw nigh,
<i>when thou shalt say...

230
00:31:49,564 --> 00:31:52,658
<i>..."I have no pleasure in them."

231
00:31:53,902 --> 00:31:54,891
<i>Remember thy Creator...

232
00:31:54,969 --> 00:31:57,870
<i>...before the silver cord be loosed.
<i>Or the golden bowl be broken...

233
00:31:58,106 --> 00:32:00,939
<i>...or the pitcher
<i>shattered at the fountain...

234
00:32:01,209 --> 00:32:04,144
<i>...or the wheel broken at the well.

235
00:32:05,447 --> 00:32:09,008
<i>Then shall the dust return
<i>to the earth as it was...

236
00:32:09,317 --> 00:32:12,343
<i>...and the spirit shall return
<i>unto God who gave it.

237
00:32:13,088 --> 00:32:17,422
<i>"Vanity of vanities, "
<i>saith the preacher; "All is vanity."

238
00:32:21,629 --> 00:32:24,029
Kirill, have you seen Father Nikodim?

239
00:32:26,801 --> 00:32:30,202
Where has he got to
since this morning?

240
00:32:30,572 --> 00:32:35,134
He took my gloves, then disappeared
as though the earth swallowed him.

241
00:32:37,812 --> 00:32:41,441
I have to chop wood
and the logs are icy.

242
00:32:44,686 --> 00:32:48,816
Why is your candle
burning? It's daylight.

243
00:32:51,192 --> 00:32:53,558
Did you feed my dog?

244
00:32:54,496 --> 00:32:56,589
Did you ask me to?

245
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:04,067
What's the matter with you?

246
00:33:12,714 --> 00:33:13,703
Go away.

247
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:19,516
<i>The words of the wise are like
<i>goads, and the words of scholars...

248
00:33:19,621 --> 00:33:22,681
<i>...are like well-driven nails,
<i>given by one Shepherd.

249
00:33:22,757 --> 00:33:26,784
<i>And further, my son, you
<i>should stay away from these.

250
00:33:27,128 --> 00:33:30,120
<i>Of making many
<i>books there is no end...

251
00:33:30,231 --> 00:33:33,166
<i>...and much study is
<i>wearisome to the flesh.

252
00:33:33,868 --> 00:33:36,166
<i>Let us hear the conclusion
<i>of the whole matter...

253
00:33:36,404 --> 00:33:38,429
<i>Fear God and keep
<i>His commandments...

254
00:33:38,506 --> 00:33:41,270
<i>...for this is man's all.

255
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:44,208
A messenger has come!

256
00:33:44,746 --> 00:33:48,079
Who has come? A messenger
from Moscow has come.

257
00:33:49,784 --> 00:33:51,979
A messenger has come
from the Grand Prince.

258
00:33:52,053 --> 00:33:54,214
- So?
- So so!

259
00:33:54,589 --> 00:33:57,319
A messenger from
Theophanes the Greek.

260
00:34:00,628 --> 00:34:03,791
The Grand Prince
orders you to Moscow...

261
00:34:03,932 --> 00:34:08,869
...to paint the Cathedral of the
Annunciation, with Theophanes.

262
00:34:14,709 --> 00:34:18,668
Is he really Andrei
Rublev, this fellow?

263
00:34:23,418 --> 00:34:26,615
Yes, he's Rublev... and I'm Kirill.

264
00:34:27,355 --> 00:34:31,724
Theophanes the Greek says
he wants you in Moscow...

265
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,991
...and he wishes to see you.

266
00:34:34,996 --> 00:34:37,260
I thank Theophanes.

267
00:34:38,499 --> 00:34:39,523
Tell him...

268
00:34:42,437 --> 00:34:44,530
...that I'll come.

269
00:34:46,608 --> 00:34:47,768
I'll come.

270
00:34:50,612 --> 00:34:52,204
My head is splitting!

271
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:58,215
Bring my horse here.

272
00:35:00,521 --> 00:35:02,011
What is wrong?

273
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:11,492
Choose whichever helpers you
like and be ready tomorrow.

274
00:35:12,166 --> 00:35:14,600
Is there a blacksmith
here? If not, I'll fall off again.

275
00:35:14,969 --> 00:35:19,372
There is a smithy outside,
beyond the chapel.

276
00:35:19,574 --> 00:35:21,701
Farewell, God-fearing people!

277
00:35:27,215 --> 00:35:28,773
Semyon! Come here!

278
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:30,681
Come here and help us!

279
00:35:30,752 --> 00:35:32,811
Why are you standing? Come here!

280
00:35:48,636 --> 00:35:51,571
Let's go today, shall we, Danil?

281
00:35:52,407 --> 00:35:58,277
Go quickly, before
Theophanes changes his mind.

282
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,807
I'm not going.

283
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,276
Why aren't you going?

284
00:36:06,154 --> 00:36:08,884
How can I manage without you?

285
00:36:09,624 --> 00:36:11,091
As best you can.

286
00:36:14,729 --> 00:36:16,321
I thought we'd go together.

287
00:36:16,931 --> 00:36:21,027
Why did you think for
me? I was not invited.

288
00:36:26,908 --> 00:36:28,773
I can't do it without you.

289
00:36:30,278 --> 00:36:35,306
You can; you agreed
to go without asking me.

290
00:36:36,317 --> 00:36:38,444
Theophanes simply beckoned.

291
00:36:40,988 --> 00:36:44,981
Don't grieve; you're
not the first, or the last.

292
00:36:46,094 --> 00:36:48,585
Even without you there's
plenty of work for me here.

293
00:36:56,771 --> 00:36:58,136
Thank God for it.

294
00:36:59,774 --> 00:37:02,504
Foma, Aleksei. Let's get ready.

295
00:37:03,678 --> 00:37:05,908
Piotr, you're coming with me.

296
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:33,768
Did you forget something, Andrei?

297
00:37:36,244 --> 00:37:38,075
I came to say farewell.

298
00:37:40,281 --> 00:37:41,543
We've said farewell.

299
00:37:54,629 --> 00:37:57,029
I came to say farewell, but...

300
00:38:02,537 --> 00:38:05,335
It was hard for me before.

301
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,438
Then the devil created
enmity between us.

302
00:38:12,847 --> 00:38:14,246
I can't go away like this.

303
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,545
I must make confession.

304
00:38:21,289 --> 00:38:22,688
Will you hear it?

305
00:38:31,499 --> 00:38:34,297
I cannot do anything, Danil...

306
00:38:36,938 --> 00:38:40,169
...after living so many years
together in the same cell.

307
00:38:43,311 --> 00:38:47,714
Apart from you, I have no one.

308
00:38:50,852 --> 00:38:53,878
I see the world with your eyes.

309
00:38:56,324 --> 00:38:57,814
I hear it with your ears...

310
00:39:00,561 --> 00:39:02,028
...with your heart.

311
00:39:10,705 --> 00:39:13,538
I am happy for you, you old fool.

312
00:39:13,941 --> 00:39:17,104
If only you knew how happy.

313
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,909
Go to Moscow. Paint;
I shall be proud of you.

314
00:39:24,318 --> 00:39:28,482
The devil tempted me the
other day too. Forgive me.

315
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:58,216
I'll come back, Danil.

316
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,528
Where are you going?
What about Vespers?

317
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:17,931
I'll manage without you.

318
00:40:18,506 --> 00:40:20,633
What's wrong with you today, Kirill?

319
00:40:22,109 --> 00:40:25,408
I'm tired of lying. I'm going
back into the secular world.

320
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:31,316
Why did we leave
the Trinity Monastery?

321
00:40:31,819 --> 00:40:35,016
Andrei, Danil, you are
not saying anything.

322
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:39,218
Because the brothers valued
profit higher than faith.

323
00:40:40,227 --> 00:40:43,128
They forgot why they had
entered a monastery. And now?

324
00:40:43,864 --> 00:40:47,960
We sought to praise God with faith
and work, but what's happened?

325
00:40:48,235 --> 00:40:50,465
The monastery's become a bazaar.

326
00:40:51,005 --> 00:40:54,566
Servant of God, how many souls
did you trade in for monasticism?

327
00:40:54,642 --> 00:40:55,631
Twenty or thirty?

328
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:59,411
And you ran after the
Father Superior, bargaining.

329
00:40:59,914 --> 00:41:04,942
For two meadows, or even one,
you bought eternal salvation.

330
00:41:05,953 --> 00:41:10,754
You don't need me to tell you,
but you prefer to keep quiet.

331
00:41:11,325 --> 00:41:16,092
Perhaps I would also tolerate all
this loathsomeness if I had talent.

332
00:41:16,964 --> 00:41:20,491
But what talent? Just a
slight ability to paint icons.

333
00:41:21,102 --> 00:41:24,902
God be praised that
He gave me no talent.

334
00:41:25,172 --> 00:41:30,303
I'm happy I'm untalented; I can
be honest and pure before God.

335
00:41:30,378 --> 00:41:32,073
You are taking sin upon your soul!

336
00:41:32,146 --> 00:41:34,842
I'll tell you something else, brothers.

337
00:41:35,282 --> 00:41:38,945
What do you want to tell us
that we don't know already?

338
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:44,790
Do you know what happens to your
sort? Speak! I won't get offended!

339
00:41:44,859 --> 00:41:45,848
Well, I...

340
00:41:45,926 --> 00:41:48,451
Get out, you dog!

341
00:41:48,896 --> 00:41:53,856
Out of my sight, you serpent!
Rejoin the secular world, slanderer!

342
00:41:54,535 --> 00:41:55,797
Now do you see?

343
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:57,159
Kirill!

344
00:41:58,973 --> 00:42:00,133
Kirill!

345
00:42:17,291 --> 00:42:21,751
It is written: " And Jesus
went into the temple of God...

346
00:42:21,996 --> 00:42:25,727
" ...and cast out all them that
sold and bought in the temple...

347
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,499
" ...and overthrew the tables
of the money changers...

348
00:42:29,904 --> 00:42:32,031
" ...and the seats of them
that sold doves.

349
00:42:32,373 --> 00:42:36,935
" And said unto them," it is written,
" My house shall be called...

350
00:42:37,211 --> 00:42:41,841
" ...the house of prayer; but ye
have made it a den of thieves."

351
00:43:41,809 --> 00:43:44,277
For three years I was
cleaning brushes for Danil...

352
00:43:44,345 --> 00:43:45,676
...before he let me touch an icon.

353
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,375
And then only to clean it.

354
00:43:48,482 --> 00:43:49,676
Don't you trust me?

355
00:43:50,718 --> 00:43:53,243
You're always lying, Foma.

356
00:43:53,454 --> 00:43:57,686
Yesterday your robe was
sticky; where were you?

357
00:43:58,225 --> 00:43:59,351
At the beehive.

358
00:43:59,894 --> 00:44:02,954
But you said you
were at the monastery.

359
00:44:03,197 --> 00:44:05,188
Just look at yourself.

360
00:44:06,433 --> 00:44:09,300
Put mud or something
on your cheek...

361
00:44:09,837 --> 00:44:12,931
...or you will swell, like a hog.

362
00:44:13,674 --> 00:44:16,165
It's too late now, it's useless.

363
00:44:19,446 --> 00:44:21,676
You're constantly making up stories.

364
00:44:26,187 --> 00:44:28,815
I even think you have a disease.

365
00:44:29,256 --> 00:44:30,917
Me? What disease?

366
00:44:33,561 --> 00:44:41,559
There is a disease where a
man lies without stopping.

367
00:44:50,077 --> 00:44:51,237
Look, Foma.

368
00:44:53,614 --> 00:44:54,911
Look, I say.

369
00:44:56,617 --> 00:44:59,848
What?

370
00:45:01,555 --> 00:45:05,218
You think you know everything so
I'm not going to teach you any more.

371
00:45:07,294 --> 00:45:08,921
Why should I learn?

372
00:45:09,129 --> 00:45:11,620
Anyway, I will have to spend
three years cleaning the brushes.

373
00:45:12,366 --> 00:45:14,391
I'm sick and tired of you, Foma.

374
00:45:14,535 --> 00:45:17,436
Go back to the monastery,
go wherever you want.

375
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:35,279
I can't understand why
I took you as a pupil.

376
00:45:35,589 --> 00:45:38,524
You are always like that. First
you say one thing then another.

377
00:45:38,792 --> 00:45:42,353
You yourself told
Theophanes I was perceptive.

378
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:46,726
You were different then;
you worked, you didn't lie.

379
00:45:51,071 --> 00:45:53,232
And do you know
what Theophanes said?

380
00:45:53,307 --> 00:45:55,002
" What does it matter
if he's perceptive?"

381
00:45:56,677 --> 00:45:58,406
Whatever Theophanes has said...

382
00:45:58,512 --> 00:46:00,537
...I can see blue colors
better than anyone else.

383
00:46:03,884 --> 00:46:07,911
You eat too much; how can you
paint with a bloated stomach?

384
00:46:08,255 --> 00:46:11,816
When your stomach's rumbling,
how can your mind work?

385
00:46:12,293 --> 00:46:15,057
The rumbling is the
only sound you hear.

386
00:46:17,298 --> 00:46:21,234
You're lucky, Foma. For
you, everything is simple.

387
00:46:21,302 --> 00:46:24,328
If you are not painting, you
are sleeping or fooling around.

388
00:46:25,406 --> 00:46:30,639
But only by prayer can
the soul transcend the flesh.

389
00:46:32,246 --> 00:46:35,079
Would you go to learn from
another teacher instead of me?

390
00:46:35,182 --> 00:46:37,844
Why not, if you tell me to go?

391
00:46:38,218 --> 00:46:40,778
Come on, come on. Don't be angry.

392
00:46:45,025 --> 00:46:46,014
What's that?

393
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:16,255
So you've decided to put
the apostle on the left, Andrei.

394
00:47:20,794 --> 00:47:23,058
Did you take the glue off the fire?

395
00:47:23,163 --> 00:47:24,994
Did you take the glue off the fire?

396
00:47:32,773 --> 00:47:34,832
Perceptive is he?

397
00:47:36,343 --> 00:47:39,107
He should be beaten
every Saturday, like a dog.

398
00:49:00,761 --> 00:49:02,490
You're obstinate, Andrei.

399
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:06,896
How did you see so much? Everyone
else is thinking only of himself.

400
00:49:07,267 --> 00:49:08,962
I saw it, Theophanes.

401
00:49:09,336 --> 00:49:12,203
The women of Moscow
gave their hair to the Tatars.

402
00:49:12,473 --> 00:49:15,306
What else could the
poor creatures do?

403
00:49:15,742 --> 00:49:20,008
Better to lose their hair than
be tortured. Is that heroic?

404
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:21,169
It is.

405
00:49:22,182 --> 00:49:27,779
It is true that Russian women
are humiliated and unhappy.

406
00:49:29,623 --> 00:49:30,954
It's not what I mean.

407
00:49:31,191 --> 00:49:35,389
Tell me honestly, are the
people ignorant or not?

408
00:49:36,763 --> 00:49:38,253
Well, are they?

409
00:49:38,499 --> 00:49:41,491
They're ignorant, but
whose fault is that?

410
00:49:41,768 --> 00:49:46,330
It's their own stupidity. Have you
never sinned through ignorance?

411
00:49:47,074 --> 00:49:48,006
Everyone has.

412
00:49:48,375 --> 00:49:52,004
And I have too. God forgive
us and make us better.

413
00:49:52,946 --> 00:49:54,573
Well, never mind.

414
00:49:55,315 --> 00:49:59,251
The Last Judgment is coming;
we'll burn like candles.

415
00:49:59,853 --> 00:50:02,253
Mark my words.

416
00:50:03,423 --> 00:50:07,792
Each will accuse the other of
his own sins, to defend himself.

417
00:50:08,962 --> 00:50:14,264
Theophanes, how can you paint with
such ideas, even accept praise?

418
00:50:16,036 --> 00:50:19,699
I have become a hermit
and lived in a cave.

419
00:50:20,307 --> 00:50:22,707
I serve God, not man.

420
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:29,271
As regards praise, what is praised
today is abused tomorrow.

421
00:50:29,616 --> 00:50:32,983
They will forget you, me, everything.

422
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,011
All is vanity and ashes. Worse
things have been forgotten.

423
00:50:37,691 --> 00:50:42,219
Humanity has already committed
every stupidity and baseness...

424
00:50:43,063 --> 00:50:44,997
...and now it only repeats them.

425
00:50:46,066 --> 00:50:50,162
Everything is an eternal circle
and it repeats and repeats itself.

426
00:50:50,971 --> 00:50:55,032
If Jesus returned to earth,
they would crucify him again.

427
00:50:55,275 --> 00:50:57,869
Of course, if only
evil is remembered...

428
00:50:59,146 --> 00:51:01,478
...then you will never be
happy in the sight of God.

429
00:51:03,383 --> 00:51:05,544
Perhaps we must forget
some things; but not all.

430
00:51:07,854 --> 00:51:09,719
I don't know how to say it.

431
00:51:10,023 --> 00:51:12,651
Then be quiet and listen to me.

432
00:51:17,164 --> 00:51:19,894
You think that one can
only do good alone?

433
00:51:20,534 --> 00:51:23,992
Good. Remember
the New Testament.

434
00:51:25,672 --> 00:51:29,438
Jesus taught people in the temples...

435
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:33,976
...so why did they
gather later? To kill him!

436
00:51:34,948 --> 00:51:37,473
"Crucify him!" they shouted.

437
00:51:38,619 --> 00:51:42,350
And the disciples? Judas
sold Him. Peter denied Him.

438
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:46,923
They all ran away,
yet they were the best.

439
00:51:47,628 --> 00:51:49,357
But they repented.

440
00:51:49,863 --> 00:51:53,993
That was afterwards,
when it was too late.

441
00:51:56,637 --> 00:52:00,368
<i>It's never too late to repent.

442
00:52:12,352 --> 00:52:14,684
<i>Of course, people do evil.

443
00:52:14,755 --> 00:52:19,385
<i>But you can not
<i>blame them altogether.

444
00:52:19,693 --> 00:52:21,160
<i>It's difficult...

445
00:52:21,895 --> 00:52:23,658
<i>...and sinful, I think.

446
00:52:24,831 --> 00:52:29,063
<i>Judas sold the Christ, and
<i>remember who bought him.

447
00:52:29,503 --> 00:52:30,527
<i>People.

448
00:52:31,571 --> 00:52:33,664
<i>And who accused Jesus?

449
00:52:34,574 --> 00:52:36,838
<i>The scribes and Pharisees...

450
00:52:37,177 --> 00:52:39,645
<i>...they could not find witnesses,
<i>however hard they tried.

451
00:52:41,014 --> 00:52:43,414
<i>"Who will testify against this innocent?"

452
00:52:44,584 --> 00:52:46,711
<i>Only later on they found the traitors.

453
00:52:46,787 --> 00:52:49,221
<i>Two were found immediately.
<i>Two, and not one.

454
00:52:50,724 --> 00:52:52,214
<i>There were only two.

455
00:52:53,026 --> 00:52:57,588
<i>The Pharisees were
<i>masters of deceit, educated.

456
00:52:58,832 --> 00:53:01,665
<i>They had studied to gain power...

457
00:53:01,735 --> 00:53:03,669
<i>...to take advantage of
<i>the people's ignorance.

458
00:53:05,472 --> 00:53:09,067
<i>We must remind people more
<i>often that they are people.

459
00:53:09,409 --> 00:53:13,368
<i>Russians, of the same
<i>blood, of the same land.

460
00:53:14,848 --> 00:53:16,907
<i>Evil is everywhere.

461
00:53:16,983 --> 00:53:20,976
<i>Someone will always sell
<i>you for thirty pieces of silver.

462
00:53:22,155 --> 00:53:25,852
<i>New misfortunes constantly
<i>befall the peasant...

463
00:53:25,959 --> 00:53:30,259
<i>...either Tatars three times an
<i>autumn, or famine, or plague...

464
00:53:30,897 --> 00:53:34,458
<i>...and he still keeps on
<i>working, working, working...

465
00:53:34,534 --> 00:53:36,695
<i>...meekly bearing his cross.

466
00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:40,638
<i>He does not despair,
<i>he is silent and patient.

467
00:53:41,141 --> 00:53:44,201
<i>He only prays to God
<i>for enough strength.

468
00:53:45,779 --> 00:53:49,306
<i>How could God not
<i>forgive him his ignorance?

469
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:57,479
<i>You know yourself. You're
<i>tired and discouraged...

470
00:53:58,125 --> 00:53:59,217
<i>...and suddenly...

471
00:53:59,426 --> 00:54:03,123
<i>...in the crowd you
<i>meet a human glance...

472
00:54:03,697 --> 00:54:07,895
<i>...and everything's lighter,
<i>as it is after Communion.

473
00:54:08,635 --> 00:54:10,125
<i>Isn't it so?

474
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:15,540
<i>You just spoke of Jesus.

475
00:54:16,243 --> 00:54:21,977
<i>Perhaps He was born and
<i>crucified to reconcile God and man.

476
00:54:22,716 --> 00:54:25,378
<i>Jesus came from God,
<i>so He is all-powerful.

477
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:31,086
<i>And if He died on the cross,
<i>it was predetermined...

478
00:54:31,825 --> 00:54:35,352
<i>...and His crucifixion
<i>and death were God's will.

479
00:54:35,562 --> 00:54:38,053
<i>That would have aroused hatred
<i>not in those who crucified Him...

480
00:54:38,131 --> 00:54:39,393
<i>...but in those who loved Him...

481
00:54:39,499 --> 00:54:44,334
<i>...if they had been near
<i>Him at that moment...

482
00:54:45,739 --> 00:54:48,537
<i>...because they loved
<i>Him as a man only.

483
00:54:49,576 --> 00:54:52,477
<i>But if He, of His own will, left them...

484
00:54:52,646 --> 00:54:56,946
<i>...He displayed injustice,
<i>or even cruelty.

485
00:54:58,118 --> 00:55:01,110
<i>Maybe those who
<i>crucified Him loved Him...

486
00:55:02,155 --> 00:55:05,556
<i>...because they helped
<i>in this divine plan.

487
00:56:26,806 --> 00:56:29,240
Do you understand
what you are saying?

488
00:56:30,343 --> 00:56:35,178
They'll exile you to the north,
man, to renovate the icons.

489
00:56:35,282 --> 00:56:40,345
Am I not right? You too
always say what you think.

490
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:45,890
But I'm not a monk; I'm free.

491
00:57:01,993 --> 00:57:06,760
THE HOLIDA Y
Spring 1408

492
00:57:22,547 --> 00:57:24,071
Sergei, over here!

493
00:57:24,982 --> 00:57:26,574
Light the fire.

494
00:57:28,219 --> 00:57:30,949
Foma, let's get some logs.

495
00:57:36,094 --> 00:57:38,153
Piotr has probably never seen...

496
00:57:38,229 --> 00:57:40,459
...either Assumption Cathedral
or Saint Dmitry Cathedral.

497
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:46,565
Never mind, he will begin
working, and understand things.

498
00:57:47,939 --> 00:57:50,430
Foma! Where are you?

499
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:52,734
We won't be on time.

500
00:57:53,177 --> 00:57:54,576
It's okay, we'll be there tomorrow.

501
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:58,111
No. We'll never finish the Cathedral
of the Assumption by winter.

502
00:57:58,249 --> 00:57:59,580
It's almost June, Andrei.

503
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:10,516
What is it?

504
00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:13,997
Quiet! Do you hear it?

505
00:58:17,769 --> 00:58:19,031
Nightingales?

506
00:58:19,404 --> 00:58:20,735
Nothing else?

507
00:58:27,211 --> 00:58:28,143
Come on.

508
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:32,849
- What is it?
- Come on.

509
00:58:49,167 --> 00:58:50,862
They're practicing witchcraft.

510
00:58:58,075 --> 00:58:59,303
Where are you going?

511
00:59:58,503 --> 00:59:59,663
Come to me.

512
01:00:00,171 --> 01:00:02,105
Hold on.

513
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:03,637
Come to me.

514
01:00:06,611 --> 01:00:08,545
Darling.

515
01:00:09,514 --> 01:00:11,106
Take your hand away.

516
01:00:20,758 --> 01:00:23,352
There is an anthill.

517
01:00:23,427 --> 01:00:24,951
Anthill?

518
01:00:25,062 --> 01:00:26,086
Anthill.

519
01:00:26,797 --> 01:00:28,924
- Who is this?
- I don't know.

520
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:30,824
Let's go.

521
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:13,904
It seemed to me...

522
01:02:14,305 --> 01:02:16,102
...as if a black snake
was hiding himself.

523
01:02:16,207 --> 01:02:19,335
What are you doing?

524
01:02:21,345 --> 01:02:22,676
Let me go!

525
01:02:22,913 --> 01:02:25,108
We'll let you go.

526
01:02:25,216 --> 01:02:29,414
At dawn, we'll hang a stone around
your neck, to help you swim.

527
01:02:32,690 --> 01:02:37,024
Heaven's fire will consume you!
The Last Judgment awaits!

528
01:02:38,195 --> 01:02:40,925
Now we'll tie you to this cross...

529
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,798
...like Jesus Christ.

530
01:02:46,337 --> 01:02:50,899
What are you doing, men?
You can't do this to me.

531
01:02:52,943 --> 01:02:55,468
This is a sin. At least
hang me upside-down.

532
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:58,571
Men, brothers!

533
01:03:03,387 --> 01:03:08,450
Leave him here for the night,
unless he ascends again.

534
01:03:11,195 --> 01:03:13,060
He's not going anywhere.

535
01:03:27,111 --> 01:03:29,306
- And who is this?
- Marfa.

536
01:03:32,516 --> 01:03:37,146
Why did you want to be head
down? It would have been worse.

537
01:03:40,257 --> 01:03:43,055
Why did you threaten us
with fire from heaven?

538
01:03:44,528 --> 01:03:47,986
It is a sin to go naked
and do what you do.

539
01:03:50,434 --> 01:03:56,669
What sin? Tonight is for
lovemaking; is love a sin?

540
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:59,972
Is it love to tie a man up like this?

541
01:04:01,579 --> 01:04:03,604
You might call the monks...

542
01:04:04,448 --> 01:04:06,678
...who would force us
to accept your faith.

543
01:04:07,017 --> 01:04:09,815
Do you think it's easy to live in fear?

544
01:04:10,488 --> 01:04:13,889
You live in fear because you
know no love but bestial love.

545
01:04:14,258 --> 01:04:18,319
Carnality without soul; but
love should be brotherly.

546
01:04:20,064 --> 01:04:22,624
Isn't all love the same? It's just love.

547
01:04:28,439 --> 01:04:29,428
What are you doing?

548
01:04:41,685 --> 01:04:42,982
Untie me.

549
01:07:55,279 --> 01:07:57,144
Why are you looking at me?

550
01:07:58,082 --> 01:07:59,447
Where were you?

551
01:08:04,655 --> 01:08:06,213
Thank God.

552
01:08:12,529 --> 01:08:14,724
Are these the people?

553
01:08:14,832 --> 01:08:17,892
No, these are strangers.
Don't you see it?

554
01:08:25,442 --> 01:08:27,910
There is some onion, if you want it.

555
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:37,748
Where were you?

556
01:08:42,459 --> 01:08:46,452
These forests are impenetrable;
I'm all scratched.

557
01:08:48,632 --> 01:08:51,601
The local people like it.
They are accustomed to it.

558
01:08:52,236 --> 01:08:55,535
For people, everything
is a matter of custom.

559
01:08:56,306 --> 01:08:59,070
Old people don't need to think...

560
01:08:59,643 --> 01:09:03,135
...for their days pass
according to custom.

561
01:09:04,314 --> 01:09:09,843
But perhaps they consciously
enjoy the way the days drag on.

562
01:09:30,841 --> 01:09:33,332
- Couldn't you get here before?
- No. I couldn't.

563
01:09:34,945 --> 01:09:37,413
That is your sin, your
conscience, your prayers.

564
01:09:44,588 --> 01:09:46,613
Get him, and her!

565
01:10:04,608 --> 01:10:07,509
Why are they doing that?

566
01:10:08,145 --> 01:10:11,808
Because the accursed pagans
don't believe in one God.

567
01:10:12,349 --> 01:10:17,446
Don't look, Sergei. There
is nothing to look at.

568
01:10:19,123 --> 01:10:20,954
Let me go!

569
01:10:24,194 --> 01:10:25,786
- Let me go!
- You can't see that!

570
01:10:35,873 --> 01:10:38,774
Kick him so he shuts up!

571
01:10:45,215 --> 01:10:47,274
Go, go! Don't dawdle!

572
01:10:54,925 --> 01:10:57,553
Help, Fyodor! Help!

573
01:11:00,898 --> 01:11:01,956
Fyodor!

574
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:06,136
Can't you deal with a woman?

575
01:11:07,337 --> 01:11:09,464
Stop!

576
01:11:10,207 --> 01:11:11,640
Hold her!

577
01:11:17,414 --> 01:11:19,279
Marfa, run!

578
01:11:19,349 --> 01:11:21,715
Catch her!

579
01:11:21,785 --> 01:11:24,652
- Where are you going?
- She will drown herself!

580
01:11:24,855 --> 01:11:28,416
Marfa! Run, Marfa!

581
01:11:33,463 --> 01:11:35,693
Swim, Marfa!

582
01:12:29,353 --> 01:12:34,655
THE LAST JUDGMENT
Summer 1408

583
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:37,284
Come here!

584
01:12:40,831 --> 01:12:42,765
He's just wasting materials.

585
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,264
Who needs it?

586
01:12:47,838 --> 01:12:48,827
Foma!

587
01:12:49,339 --> 01:12:52,866
- What do you want?
- Can I go for a swim?

588
01:12:52,976 --> 01:12:55,911
- No, you can't.
- It's hot!

589
01:12:56,780 --> 01:12:58,577
Don't be lying. It's not.

590
01:12:58,882 --> 01:13:01,578
Maybe he's really hot. I'm hot too.

591
01:13:01,785 --> 01:13:03,912
Of course, you are
working and he is sitting.

592
01:13:04,021 --> 01:13:06,080
Let him go swim.

593
01:13:06,223 --> 01:13:08,123
Don't spoil him.

594
01:13:08,425 --> 01:13:09,756
Let him be sitting with everyone.

595
01:13:09,826 --> 01:13:11,760
You shut up!

596
01:13:11,928 --> 01:13:15,261
You sleep all day long like a log...

597
01:13:15,799 --> 01:13:19,166
...and you come down only
to eat and go to the bathroom.

598
01:13:19,670 --> 01:13:22,161
And have you found a job for me?

599
01:13:22,239 --> 01:13:25,072
- You have found what you wanted.
- So what?

600
01:13:26,209 --> 01:13:28,939
Since everyone is sitting here,
let Serezhka be sitting with us too.

601
01:13:29,046 --> 01:13:31,241
If you had let him go, he
would have been back already.

602
01:13:31,415 --> 01:13:33,406
Give him freedom...

603
01:13:33,483 --> 01:13:35,508
...and he will sit in the
water until he turns blue.

604
01:13:35,585 --> 01:13:37,519
He only thinks that it's hot...

605
01:13:37,587 --> 01:13:40,055
- ...and that's why he is whining.
- He's not whining, you are.

606
01:13:40,123 --> 01:13:41,055
It was me.

607
01:13:41,124 --> 01:13:44,025
I was the first to say
it's hot, and not Sergei.

608
01:13:44,094 --> 01:13:45,459
Why are you picking on Sergei?

609
01:13:46,930 --> 01:13:48,329
That's it!

610
01:13:48,732 --> 01:13:50,495
You want to go swimming, go!

611
01:13:50,901 --> 01:13:53,028
Go! Why are you sitting?

612
01:13:54,004 --> 01:13:55,972
Go, go!

613
01:13:57,074 --> 01:13:58,063
Here! You see?

614
01:13:58,675 --> 01:14:00,700
Wait! Wait!

615
01:14:03,714 --> 01:14:04,806
Where's Andrei?

616
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:09,411
Not here? This is a
fine state of affairs.

617
01:14:14,524 --> 01:14:16,549
I was at our bishop's house just now.

618
01:14:18,729 --> 01:14:21,596
Such a fuss. Yelling!

619
01:14:22,699 --> 01:14:26,863
He was purple with rage.
" I've lost patience!" he cried.

620
01:14:27,204 --> 01:14:29,934
He meant you. All of you.

621
01:14:30,841 --> 01:14:34,140
" For two whole months," he said,
"everything has been ready.

622
01:14:34,211 --> 01:14:35,473
" But they haven't started yet.

623
01:14:35,545 --> 01:14:40,107
" Nothing is ready; they asked for
so much money, but do nothing.

624
01:14:40,650 --> 01:14:43,710
" None of them is working
and nothing is ready."

625
01:14:44,521 --> 01:14:47,183
Did you ask for a lot of money?

626
01:14:47,357 --> 01:14:48,949
How do I know?

627
01:14:49,226 --> 01:14:52,389
He said, " I don't care. Danil
Chorny or Andrei Rublev...

628
01:14:52,462 --> 01:14:54,396
" ...it's all the same to me."

629
01:14:55,031 --> 01:14:57,932
" It's all the same."

630
01:14:58,568 --> 01:15:01,036
And he pulled a face like this.

631
01:15:04,374 --> 01:15:07,707
" What do I care
about Andrei Rublev?

632
01:15:10,247 --> 01:15:11,839
" By autumn," he says, ...

633
01:15:12,649 --> 01:15:15,140
" ...I want the cathedral
painted, and that's that!"

634
01:15:16,153 --> 01:15:20,089
He's sent a courier with a
complaint to the Grand Prince.

635
01:15:21,558 --> 01:15:23,253
He's sent a courier
to the Grand Prince.

636
01:15:23,927 --> 01:15:26,418
It's a complaint about you, you know.

637
01:15:28,532 --> 01:15:31,194
You haven't started yet.

638
01:15:32,903 --> 01:15:37,897
You'd better hurry
up. Where's Andrei?

639
01:15:39,042 --> 01:15:40,942
He's gone somewhere again.

640
01:15:41,278 --> 01:15:43,303
Can't you start without him?

641
01:15:44,314 --> 01:15:46,077
Go on, start without him.

642
01:15:48,685 --> 01:15:51,415
Why are you smirking?
There are so many of you.

643
01:15:52,355 --> 01:15:55,153
If he can't make his mind
up, can't one of you?

644
01:15:55,225 --> 01:15:57,159
Two heads are better than one.

645
01:15:58,862 --> 01:16:00,227
Where is Andrei?

646
01:16:04,301 --> 01:16:05,928
I can't go on like that.

647
01:16:06,069 --> 01:16:07,764
Answer me: yes or no?

648
01:16:08,371 --> 01:16:11,670
Yes or no? Wasn't
everything decided in Moscow?

649
01:16:12,943 --> 01:16:17,937
To the smallest detail; the Prince
said everything was in order.

650
01:16:19,983 --> 01:16:25,080
What is not clear? What have we
been discussing for two months?

651
01:16:27,057 --> 01:16:29,890
Explain it to me. I may be
old, I may have lost my wits.

652
01:16:33,263 --> 01:16:35,629
The Last Judgment; either you
accept the task and paint it...

653
01:16:36,766 --> 01:16:38,859
...or you refuse the commission.

654
01:16:39,135 --> 01:16:42,798
And if we really refused?
If we went back, Danil?

655
01:16:43,173 --> 01:16:46,506
How shall I face people?
I should die of shame.

656
01:16:49,479 --> 01:16:51,913
We're wasting such good
time. This heat, no rain.

657
01:16:53,617 --> 01:16:56,848
We could have finished
the cupola and the columns.

658
01:16:58,154 --> 01:17:00,247
How wonderfully they
could have been done...

659
01:17:00,724 --> 01:17:02,453
...how brightly, and beautifully.

660
01:17:03,727 --> 01:17:05,388
On the right, the sinners...

661
01:17:06,263 --> 01:17:09,699
...boiling in pitch, painted
to make your flesh crawl.

662
01:17:12,135 --> 01:17:15,571
I have thought of a great devil,
with smoke from his nose and eyes.

663
01:17:16,339 --> 01:17:19,831
- It's not the smoke that matters.
- Then what matters?

664
01:17:19,943 --> 01:17:20,932
I don't know.

665
01:17:21,311 --> 01:17:23,871
- Why aren't you looking at me?
- Because I can't.

666
01:17:40,330 --> 01:17:44,960
I can't paint all that; it disgusts me.

667
01:17:47,203 --> 01:17:50,263
I don't want to terrify people.
Understand me, Danil.

668
01:17:52,275 --> 01:17:55,210
Collect yourself! Listen!
It's the Last Judgment!

669
01:17:55,812 --> 01:17:57,370
I didn't invent it.

670
01:17:57,447 --> 01:17:59,745
I can't do it. Do as
you will, but I can't.

671
01:17:59,883 --> 01:18:02,511
Why didn't you speak
earlier, in Moscow?

672
01:18:03,119 --> 01:18:04,677
You shouldn't have agreed.

673
01:18:06,990 --> 01:18:08,389
This is dishonest.

674
01:18:08,491 --> 01:18:11,483
I am what I am. You
couldn't teach me integrity.

675
01:18:28,478 --> 01:18:31,174
I don't know what to paint.

676
01:18:32,148 --> 01:18:33,706
What do you mean, you don't know?

677
01:18:34,985 --> 01:18:37,249
We were ordered to
paint the Last Judgment.

678
01:18:39,889 --> 01:18:41,550
You see...

679
01:18:42,892 --> 01:18:44,792
...I think it will be better...

680
01:18:45,095 --> 01:18:47,461
...if we don't paint the
Last Judgment at all.

681
01:18:49,666 --> 01:18:50,690
What do you mean?

682
01:18:52,802 --> 01:18:54,030
You know.

683
01:18:55,939 --> 01:18:57,236
I want...

684
01:19:06,116 --> 01:19:07,777
I don't want anything.

685
01:19:08,385 --> 01:19:10,615
- Nothing.
- That's it.

686
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:19,428
Well, I'm leaving.

687
01:19:21,131 --> 01:19:23,827
This is no work for me.

688
01:19:24,834 --> 01:19:29,771
Thanks for your kindness and
your slaps; I learned something.

689
01:19:30,774 --> 01:19:33,072
But now I'm going to work for myself.

690
01:19:35,979 --> 01:19:38,311
They've asked me to
paint a church at Pafnutievo.

691
01:19:39,783 --> 01:19:41,580
Not a great honor,
but it's still an honor.

692
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:46,416
I'm going to paint the Last Judgment.

693
01:19:48,558 --> 01:19:49,855
Who will come with me?

694
01:19:53,963 --> 01:19:55,487
Well, then, stay...

695
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:59,168
...but don't complain later.

696
01:20:15,985 --> 01:20:17,646
<i>When I was a child...

697
01:20:18,188 --> 01:20:23,490
<i>...I spake as a child, I understood
<i>as a child, I thought as a child...

698
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:26,992
<i>...but when I became a man,
<i>I put away childish things.

699
01:20:27,797 --> 01:20:31,733
<i>For now we see
<i>through a glass, darkly...

700
01:20:32,268 --> 01:20:33,735
<i>...but then face to face...

701
01:20:34,704 --> 01:20:36,228
<i>...now I know in part...

702
01:20:36,773 --> 01:20:38,764
<i>...but then shall I know...

703
01:20:38,842 --> 01:20:40,070
<i>...even as also I am known.

704
01:20:41,177 --> 01:20:43,509
<i>And now abideth...

705
01:20:43,947 --> 01:20:46,040
<i>...faith, hope, and charity...

706
01:20:46,816 --> 01:20:48,784
<i>...but the greatest of these is charity.

707
01:20:49,586 --> 01:20:53,283
<i>Though I speak with the
<i>tongues of men and of angels...

708
01:20:53,356 --> 01:20:54,687
<i>...and have not charity...

709
01:20:55,058 --> 01:20:57,720
<i>...I am become as sounding
<i>brass, or a tinkling cymbal.

710
01:20:58,128 --> 01:20:59,686
<i>And though I have
<i>the gift of prophecy...

711
01:20:59,763 --> 01:21:01,754
<i>...and understand all
<i>mysteries, and all knowledge...

712
01:21:01,831 --> 01:21:06,393
<i>...and though I have all faith, so
<i>that I could remove mountains...

713
01:21:06,503 --> 01:21:08,733
<i>...and have not charity, I am nothing.

714
01:21:09,105 --> 01:21:15,135
<i>And though I bestow all
<i>my goods to feed the poor...

715
01:21:16,346 --> 01:21:18,871
<i>...and though I give my body to
<i>be burned, and have not charity...

716
01:21:19,883 --> 01:21:22,408
<i>...it profiteth me nothing.

717
01:21:22,619 --> 01:21:26,680
<i>Charity suffereth long, and
<i>is kind; charity envieth not...

718
01:21:26,756 --> 01:21:28,656
<i>...charity vaunteth not
<i>itself, is not puffed up...

719
01:21:29,926 --> 01:21:32,724
<i>...doth not behave
<i>itself unseemly...

720
01:21:32,796 --> 01:21:36,391
<i>...seeketh not her own, is not
<i>easily provoked, thinketh no evil...

721
01:21:38,601 --> 01:21:40,796
<i>...rejoiceth not in iniquity,
<i>but rejoiceth in the truth...

722
01:21:40,870 --> 01:21:44,306
<i>...beareth all things...

723
01:21:44,407 --> 01:21:47,934
<i>...believeth all things, hopeth
<i>all things, endureth all things.

724
01:21:50,346 --> 01:21:52,541
Charity never faileth...

725
01:21:54,951 --> 01:21:57,181
...but whether there be
prophecies, they shall fail...

726
01:21:57,253 --> 01:21:59,187
...whether there be
tongues, they shall cease...

727
01:22:00,056 --> 01:22:02,217
...whether there be
knowledge, it shall vanish away.

728
01:22:03,426 --> 01:22:05,155
For we know in part...

729
01:22:07,497 --> 01:22:10,898
Princess, is that nice?

730
01:22:12,001 --> 01:22:14,094
It's sinful to splash milk.

731
01:22:15,104 --> 01:22:17,470
Such a naughtiness.

732
01:22:20,677 --> 01:22:24,408
- Why is it sinful?
- Because... wipe it off.

733
01:22:25,782 --> 01:22:28,080
But it will dry by itself in a minute.

734
01:22:29,219 --> 01:22:32,154
Let's walk by the stream.

735
01:22:35,792 --> 01:22:38,818
Let me go, Stepan, or I'll
send you to the stables.

736
01:22:43,299 --> 01:22:44,926
How do you like it?

737
01:22:46,502 --> 01:22:51,064
I couldn't imagine it
better. It's light, beautiful.

738
01:23:01,618 --> 01:23:02,846
It's light.

739
01:23:04,954 --> 01:23:09,414
Take her out. Her
nurses have spoiled her.

740
01:23:09,492 --> 01:23:10,959
I say!

741
01:23:11,027 --> 01:23:14,019
No one can build a
mansion better than us.

742
01:23:14,297 --> 01:23:16,458
Who could paint like that?

743
01:23:16,599 --> 01:23:17,588
Look at the carving.

744
01:23:17,667 --> 01:23:21,831
Only Mitiai can do this
directly, without tracing.

745
01:23:21,971 --> 01:23:23,939
It's like a bird singing.

746
01:23:25,575 --> 01:23:27,566
Look. Maybe it is like a bird singing.

747
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:33,513
I don't care. I can sleep on the
hay. You are the Grand Prince.

748
01:23:33,683 --> 01:23:35,446
Don't you like it?

749
01:23:35,518 --> 01:23:37,986
I'll tell you this. It
should be repainted.

750
01:23:38,421 --> 01:23:41,049
Walls, ceiling, everything:
brighter, stronger colors.

751
01:23:43,726 --> 01:23:45,353
I've been in this trade for forty years.

752
01:23:45,495 --> 01:23:46,860
It's not the years that matter...

753
01:23:46,996 --> 01:23:49,464
...but your ability to glorify the
Grand Prince with your work.

754
01:23:49,532 --> 01:23:51,363
That's enough. Go.

755
01:23:53,803 --> 01:23:56,203
We won't redo anything.

756
01:23:56,506 --> 01:24:00,169
It's time to go. We have another job.

757
01:24:00,243 --> 01:24:02,108
They are waiting for us in Zvenigorod.

758
01:24:03,012 --> 01:24:04,001
Where?

759
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:07,413
At your brother's. They
have the stone already.

760
01:24:08,851 --> 01:24:11,217
A beautiful stone. Whiter than this.

761
01:24:12,188 --> 01:24:14,622
When your brother came at Easter...

762
01:24:15,425 --> 01:24:19,862
...we made a deal and he said: " Do
what you like, whatever the cost.

763
01:24:21,631 --> 01:24:25,294
" I'll tax the peasants more, just
build me the best mansion possible."

764
01:24:26,402 --> 01:24:28,768
Then go to Zvenigorod.

765
01:24:33,009 --> 01:24:34,601
Here, I have brought it.

766
01:24:39,282 --> 01:24:42,308
When I looked at the
Prince, he became numb.

767
01:24:42,385 --> 01:24:47,482
- When I mentioned Zvenigorod?
- Yes, he became paralyzed.

768
01:24:47,657 --> 01:24:50,649
He fears his brother will outshine him.

769
01:24:52,261 --> 01:24:55,230
- Who carved that?
- I did.

770
01:24:57,333 --> 01:24:59,198
Why didn't you set it in the wall?

771
01:25:00,036 --> 01:25:01,628
It didn't come out right.

772
01:25:02,205 --> 01:25:03,502
Pity; it's rather good.

773
01:25:05,208 --> 01:25:10,305
Everything crumbles: I told the Prince
to spare no expense on the stone.

774
01:25:11,014 --> 01:25:14,506
Maybe now he's sorry when
he heard about Zvenigorod.

775
01:25:15,284 --> 01:25:17,252
I could have carved
beautiful things for him.

776
01:25:21,991 --> 01:25:25,324
Come on, you ass!

777
01:25:40,243 --> 01:25:41,540
Where's Stepan?

778
01:25:44,247 --> 01:25:46,442
Where did Stepan gallop to?

779
01:25:47,183 --> 01:25:49,344
He went to Zvenigorod
with the others.

780
01:25:57,226 --> 01:25:59,456
I've dirtied my hands.

781
01:26:16,946 --> 01:26:20,848
We'll build another mansion just
as good for the Prince's brother.

782
01:26:21,784 --> 01:26:24,116
Will the stone be better there?

783
01:26:24,921 --> 01:26:26,320
Yes, it will.

784
01:26:27,457 --> 01:26:29,482
Look, the Captain of the Guard.

785
01:26:39,469 --> 01:26:40,834
Hold on, old man.

786
01:27:24,547 --> 01:27:28,074
You, ass! Help him! In the bushes!

787
01:27:39,061 --> 01:27:40,460
Where's my whip?

788
01:28:03,019 --> 01:28:05,988
Has anyone seen my whip?

789
01:28:07,957 --> 01:28:11,620
Damn. I've lost it. Have
you seen my whip, ass?

790
01:30:38,674 --> 01:30:40,642
- Seryoga.
- What?

791
01:30:41,544 --> 01:30:42,977
Read the Scriptures.

792
01:30:43,346 --> 01:30:44,335
From where?

793
01:30:45,381 --> 01:30:46,609
From wherever you like.

794
01:30:57,560 --> 01:31:01,121
" lmitate me, just as
I also imitate Christ.

795
01:31:01,330 --> 01:31:06,267
" Now I praise you, brethren, that
ye remember me in all things...

796
01:31:06,335 --> 01:31:08,462
" ...and keep the ordinances
as I delivered them to you.

797
01:31:08,537 --> 01:31:13,668
" But I would have you know, that
the head of every man is Christ...

798
01:31:13,743 --> 01:31:15,574
" ...and the head of the
woman is the man...

799
01:31:15,644 --> 01:31:17,509
" ...and the head of Christ is God.

800
01:31:17,580 --> 01:31:22,517
" Every man praying or prophesying,
having his head covered...

801
01:31:22,585 --> 01:31:27,955
" ...dishonoreth his head. But every
woman that prayeth or prophesieth...

802
01:31:28,023 --> 01:31:31,584
" ...with her head uncovered,
dishonoreth her head...

803
01:31:31,660 --> 01:31:34,857
" ...for that is even all one
as if she were shaven.

804
01:31:34,930 --> 01:31:38,957
" For if the woman be not
covered, let her also be shorn...

805
01:31:39,034 --> 01:31:42,902
" ...but if it be shame for a woman
to be shorn or shaven...

806
01:31:42,972 --> 01:31:45,065
" ...let her be covered.

807
01:31:45,141 --> 01:31:48,338
" For a man ought

Danil, listen.

It's a feast.

836
01:34:52,361 --> 01:34:54,158
It's a feast, Danil,
and you are saying...

837
01:34:54,797 --> 01:34:57,425
They are not sinners...

838
01:34:59,001 --> 01:35:01,231
She is not a sinner, even if
she does not wear a scarf.

839
01:35:14,116 --> 01:35:15,981
She is not a sinner.

Leave him alone. Let
God's servant repent.

The Passion According to Andrei
Part Two

842
01:36:50,296 --> 01:36:54,858
THE RAID
Autumn of 1408

843
01:37:14,687 --> 01:37:18,453
They are coming! The
Tatars are coming, Prince!

844
01:38:07,173 --> 01:38:09,937
Hey, Prince! Is this your ford?

845
01:38:10,844 --> 01:38:15,076
It has been raining, and
everything is flooded. Follow us.

846
01:38:45,044 --> 01:38:47,911
We were just going to leave.
We expected you yesterday.

847
01:38:48,715 --> 01:38:53,618
I couldn't resist attacking
a small town on my way.

848
01:38:53,753 --> 01:38:54,742
I am sorry I am late.

849
01:38:54,921 --> 01:38:57,788
Never mind. Let's go. It will be
shallow to the left. Keep to the left.

850
01:39:02,562 --> 01:39:04,757
This isn't a trap?

851
01:39:05,131 --> 01:39:07,122
Believe me, Vladimir is deserted.

852
01:39:07,267 --> 01:39:10,202
My brother, the Grand
Prince, is in Lithuania.

853
01:39:10,370 --> 01:39:12,395
Here is the town, behind that forest.

854
01:39:13,039 --> 01:39:16,805
They say the Prince has a
son, but you want the throne.

855
01:39:18,344 --> 01:39:19,709
We'll see.

856
01:39:21,114 --> 01:39:24,083
I see you want the
throne. I understand.

857
01:39:29,822 --> 01:39:31,414
You were told to keep left.

858
01:39:37,597 --> 01:39:38,757
Grab this!

859
01:41:13,526 --> 01:41:16,017
Come on, Prince! Don't lag behind!

860
01:41:27,974 --> 01:41:29,532
Strong is your love for your brother.

861
01:41:29,909 --> 01:41:31,570
This is our destiny.

862
01:41:32,578 --> 01:41:34,341
When were you last
reconciled with him?

863
01:41:34,747 --> 01:41:38,148
I never was. The
Metropolitan summoned us...

864
01:41:39,952 --> 01:41:42,420
...and made us kiss the cross
and swear to live in harmony.

865
01:41:42,488 --> 01:41:43,477
What are you saying?

866
01:41:43,556 --> 01:41:45,490
The Metropolitan
summoned us to kiss the cross.

867
01:41:45,558 --> 01:41:47,719
- When?
- Last winter.

868
01:42:42,482 --> 01:42:44,814
Vladimir is a beautiful town.

869
01:42:44,884 --> 01:42:46,010
Do you like it?

870
01:42:55,962 --> 01:42:57,361
Let's go.

871
01:43:41,641 --> 01:43:45,475
Forward! You dog,
stay close, or I'll kill you!

872
01:43:47,113 --> 01:43:50,514
Keep close to the
Prince! To the gates!

873
01:44:43,469 --> 01:44:45,198
Tatars!

874
01:44:45,972 --> 01:44:47,940
Run away!
