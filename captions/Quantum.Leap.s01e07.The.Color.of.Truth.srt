1
00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:04,704
<i>It all started when a time travel</i>
<i>experiment I was conducting... </i>

2
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:07,706
<i>went... a little caca. </i>

3
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:11,269
<i>In the blink of a cosmic clock,
I went from quantum physicist... </i>

4
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:14,712
<i>... to air force test pilot, </i>

5
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:18,182
<i>which could have been fun</i>
<i>if I knew how to fly. </i>

6
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:21,516
<i>Fortunately, I had help, </i>
<i>an observer from the project named Al. </i>

7
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:26,457
<i>Unfortunately, Al's a hologram, </i>
<i>so all he can lend is moral support. </i>

8
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:29,518
<i>Anyway, here I am, </i>
<i>bouncing around in time, </i>

9
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:31,689
<i>putting things right</i>
<i>that once went wrong</i>

10
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:35,633
<i>a sort of time-traveling Lone Ranger</i>
<i>with Al as my Tonto, </i>

11
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:39,165
<i>and I don't even need a mask. </i>

12
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,173
Oh, boy.

13
00:01:57,284 --> 00:02:00,276
<i>If the truth be
known, once I got into it, </i>

14
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:02,116
<i>quantum leaping turned out
to be a lot of fun. </i>

15
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:06,387
<i>So far, I've been able to save</i>
<i>two lives, one ball game and a pig. </i>

16
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,224
<i>I fought for the faith of a nun</i>
<i>and against the mob, </i>

17
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:14,233
<i>put together three couples, a father and
daughter and the lyrics to "Peggy Sue"</i>

18
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:17,168
<i>Like I said, stepping into someone
else's shoes can be a lot of fun. </i>

19
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,171
- B-8.
- Bingo.

20
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:32,817
<i>Now all I have to figure out
is whose shoes I'm wearing... </i>

21
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:35,650
<i>and the path I'm walking. </i>

22
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:40,216
<i>But since I'm here and I'm hungry,
how about somethin' to eat?</i>

23
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:44,553
Well!

24
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,446
There's gotta be some mistake.

25
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,491
Biggest mistake
you'll ever make, boy.

26
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:14,789
Ain't that right, Toad?
Right as rain, Billy Joe.

27
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:18,856
All right, you two, why
don't you just cut it out?

28
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:21,992
I don't wanna spend the afternoon
cleanin'up blood, do I, Jesse?

29
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,137
Uh, n-no, you don't.

30
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,867
So why don't you just
take Miz Melny's lunch and get...

31
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,637
before these boys lose
what little control they have?

32
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:34,578
Miz Melny's, uh, lunch.
Yeah, right.

33
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:38,175
Thanks.

34
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:12,008
<i>I didn't know exactly where I was, </i>

35
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,849
<i>but it was obviously too far South</i>
<i>to be a black man. </i>

36
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:18,789
Jesse!
Jesse Tyler!

37
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,918
You come over here
this instant.

38
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,656
<i>Maybe all I'm here to do is... </i>

39
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,130
<i>help a little old lady</i>
<i>across the street... </i>

40
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,531
<i>or get her cat down</i>
<i>out of a tree... </i>

41
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,593
<i>or deliver this lunch to</i>
Miz Melny.

42
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,764
Jesse, it has got to be 100 degrees.

43
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,206
You left me standin' here
in all this heat.

44
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:41,873
I told you I was goin' to Sumter's
for five minutes. Five minutes...

45
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:45,645
and all you had to do was
pick up my egg salad at Miz Patty's.

46
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:50,550
I never did understand
why that salad was so good.

47
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:53,218
<i>Why do I get the feeling</i>
<i>this isn't going to be a good day?</i>

48
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,724
She wins at the county fair
every summer.

49
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,162
I swear,
I don't understand why.

50
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:02,724
- Excuse me. Miz Melny? Car's open.
- What?

51
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,066
Well, I didn't leave you
standing outside in the heat,

52
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,265
because the car door
was already open.

53
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,798
Jesse, I have told you
a hundred times...

54
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:12,936
to never leave my car
unlocked.

55
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,040
Now start rollin' down
these windows.

56
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:21,019
It is hotter than Tophet
in here...

57
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:23,453
in my unlocked car.

58
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,759
Thank you.

59
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,166
What in tarnation
are you starin' at?

60
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,376
I was just wonderin'
where we were going.

61
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:50,314
I swear, Jesse. I'm the one
that's supposed to be old and senile.

62
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,442
At least that's what
Clayton keeps tellin' me.

63
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:56,546
Will you stop lookin' at me
like a lost sheep and drive.

64
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:59,421
Miz Melny, you-you remember...

65
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,483
when I fell down
and I bumped my head?

66
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:05,530
Ever since then, I've had the
damndest time remembering things.

67
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:07,964
First of all, Mr. Tyler,

68
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,002
you watch your language
around me.

69
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,538
Sorry, ma'am.
And secondly,

70
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:15,301
you never told me a thing
about your head.

71
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:19,343
And third...

72
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,346
Third...

73
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:24,645
You were gonna tell me where
we were going and how to get there.

74
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:29,519
We are goin' where we have gone
every Saturday afternoon...

75
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:33,355
for the last seven years,
to see Charles.

76
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:36,395
To see Charles.
Oh, for heaven sakes.

77
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:40,422
Make a left at Magnolia
and drive toward the hospital.

78
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:53,210
<i>Of all the people I've leaped into, </i>
<i>Jesse should have been the strangest. </i>

79
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,270
<i>But there was something</i>
<i>very comfortable about him... </i>

80
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,714
<i>like putting on a pair</i>
<i>of your favorite shoes... </i>

81
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:59,877
<i>or a jacket</i>
<i>you've broken in just right. </i>

82
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,078
<i>So now that I've sort of</i>
<i>accepted being Jesse, </i>

83
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,147
<i>I just have to figure out</i>
<i>what I'm here to do. </i>

84
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,456
How long you gonna let
that turn signal blink?

85
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,520
You made the turn
five minutes ago.

86
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,589
I'm sorry.
I guess my mind was wandering.

87
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,964
Well, just let your mind
wander in your car...

88
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:19,005
and stop runnin' down
my batteries.

89
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:21,063
Well, it doesn't run down
the batteries.

90
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:23,905
See, they recharge...
Don't tell me about cars.

91
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:27,344
My Charles told me quite a bit
about them and how they work,

92
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:31,316
and I don't need you tellin' me
anything about my own car.

93
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:33,579
Charles is your husband.

94
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:36,053
Jesse, are you losin' your mind?

95
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,522
Now mind my wheels
on the railroad tracks.

96
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,889
Just turn in there.

97
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,056
Yes, Miz Melny. Stop with all your
tomfoolery, or I'm gonna get all flustered.

98
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:48,828
And I hate to visit Charles
when I get all flustered.

99
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:51,837
Oh, look, Jesse.
It's all gone to seed.

100
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,939
They're supposed
to take out all the weeds.

101
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:01,338
They never keep the weeds away.

102
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:08,653
They promised me, Jesse.

103
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:11,986
They promised me that they
were going to clear these weeds.

104
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:14,117
Here, let me do this.

105
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:16,185
Miz Melny.

106
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,591
Let me do this.
Oh.

107
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,658
Sit down.

108
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:26,595
There you go.

109
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:30,006
Oh, now, see?
You got your gloves all dirty.

110
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:33,568
I get so flustered...

111
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,313
knowin' he's not
bein' taken care of.

112
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:42,149
We always took
such good care of each other.

113
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:47,218
In 50 years, that man
never let a bad thing happen.

114
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:53,121
Well, we lost Beau,
but that wasn't his fault.

115
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,726
As Charles said, the good Lord
needed that boy to come home.

116
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:58,794
It's hard losing
somebody you love.

117
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:02,308
Well, I guess you know
as much about that as I do.

118
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,208
Your Sally lost four, didn't she?

119
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,806
Yeah, I guess we did.

120
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:12,409
Charles always thought highly
of your Sally.

121
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,476
When she passed,
I remember him tellin' me...

122
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,886
there wasn't a finer "niggra" woman...

123
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:19,686
in all of Alabama.

124
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:24,396
I'm just gonna, uh,

125
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,190
just gonna throw these
in the trash.

126
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:43,708
They didn't supply trash cans
in public places in the '50s.

127
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,752
I'm tryin' to remember when they
started that "Pitch In" campaign.

128
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:50,619
Must have been
the '70s or- Hi, Sam.

129
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,681
Well?
Well, what?

130
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:56,353
What do you think?
What do I think about what?

131
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,863
I'm black.
You're black. So?

132
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:03,335
So? If I can bounce into a black man,
the possibilities are limitless.

133
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:05,394
Don't you find that fascinating?

134
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:08,304
Dangerous, yes.
Fascinating? Mezzo mezzo.

135
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,308
Dangerous? Why dangerous?

136
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:13,709
You're a black man in the South
in 1955.

137
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,442
Trust me. That is dangerous.

138
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:18,814
I've seen things
that would curl your hair.

139
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:20,819
No pun intended.

140
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:25,347
I remember one time in Selma...
Yeah, Al, that's great. Listen, um...

141
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:27,950
What did, uh...

142
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:30,928
What did Ziggy say
I have to do to leap?

143
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:37,258
Mrs. Melny Elizabeth
Charlotte Trafford...

144
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:40,932
was killed when her car
was struck and demolished...

145
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:43,441
by a passenger train at...

146
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:46,672
that crossing,
tomorrow afternoon at 5:18.

147
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:49,840
No.
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

148
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:54,512
Ziggy's 86. 7% certain
that you're here...

149
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:57,613
to save Scarlet O'Hara there
from getting, uh,

150
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,851
squished by a choo-choo.

151
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,329
What about Jesse?
Was he squish...

152
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:07,456
Was he killed too?

153
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:11,094
No, Ziggy doesn't know. He's having
trouble finding any data on Jesse.

154
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,435
Can't even find a birth certificate
or a death certificate.

155
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,498
Great. I've replaced a man
who didn't exist.

156
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:18,510
It's not uncommon for there
to be no records...

157
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:21,741
for a Southern black man
in the '50s,

158
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:25,306
especially in a little burg
like Red Dog.

159
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:27,876
You know,

160
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:30,821
I seem to recall that some
of the very first protests...

161
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,654
started right- right near here.

162
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:36,320
This might be where
Autherine Ruth came from.

163
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:38,796
Who?
Autherine Ruth.

164
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:42,631
She was the young black coed
that integrated the University of Alabama.

165
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,227
How do you know
so much about this?

166
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:49,332
A lot of my friends are black. I
don't believe you said that, Al.

167
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:52,537
Well, it's true.
Besides, I was here.

168
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,205
I went on the marches
and got arrested and beaten.

169
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,845
Saw a lot of good people fall.

170
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,615
Those were... powerful days.

171
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:04,680
What if that's what
I'm here to do?

172
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:09,056
What, get involved
in the Civil Rights movement?

173
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:11,119
Uh-uh. No, Sam,
I don't think so.

174
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:14,689
Why not?

175
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:18,430
That's why you're here...

176
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:25,375
to save Miz Melny from being killed
tomorrow afternoon...

177
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:28,437
by the Alabama and Pacific.

178
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:39,180
Now you be careful
with those clippin's, Jesse.

179
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,556
Verbena Chilton gave me
that piece of jade tree...

180
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:45,154
all the way from her sister's
in California.

181
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:48,325
Though I don't know why anyone
would want to go to a place...

182
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:51,734
as uncivilized as California.

183
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:53,863
Jesse.

184
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,740
Put that jade in some water
till it gets a chance to root.

185
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:03,512
Clayton? You're early.
Supper's not till 6:00.

186
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,108
I thought I'd come by
and have a little talk with Jesse.

187
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:09,643
Not till he puts that jade
in water.

188
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,747
What in heaven's name you want
to talk to Jesse about?

189
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:14,054
Nothin' that you need
to fret about.

190
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,493
We'll just talk
in the kitchen, Jesse.

191
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:28,258
I guess you realize you
upset damn near the whole town

192
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:30,036
with that little business
you pulled today.

193
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:30,700
Business?

194
00:13:30,701 --> 00:13:32,475
Don't act dumb with me, Jesse.

195
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:35,275
I talkin' about you sittin' down
at Miz Patty's today.

196
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,516
Well, it was a lunch counter,
and I was hungry.

197
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:43,919
So I... sat down to have some lunch. Lunch?

198
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,424
Now, why would you do
anything so stupid?

199
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,726
You got one of them uppity Northern
niggers stayin' with you, Jesse?

200
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:56,368
No, I-I...

201
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:58,495
I don't believe I do.

202
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:01,563
Well, I can't
figure this out.

203
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:03,632
I know you can't read,

204
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:06,940
and you say you ain't got one of them
Northern niggers stayin' with you.

205
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,573
How would you get such a
stupid notion in your head?

206
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:11,640
Look, like I said,
I was hungry.

207
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:14,948
Well, you take my advice, boy.
You don't get that hungry.

208
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:33,261
Clayton, when you come back
for supper,

209
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,671
bring me some buttermilk
from Mr. Sumter's.

210
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:40,606
Mama, we have to talk.

211
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,240
Whatever Jesse did at Miz Patty's,

212
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:46,149
it don't make the least bit
of never mind to me.

213
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,983
I swear, you got ears
like a hawk.

214
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,717
I'm old, not dead.

215
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:55,090
Now, Mama, you are the widow
of the governor of this state.

216
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:58,187
Now, when your niggra
starts actin' uppity,

217
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:00,698
people take notice of that.

218
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:03,530
Clayton Sherwood Trafford.

219
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,867
I don't need you
to lecture me.

220
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:10,307
I know who I was married to, and I know
the responsibilities that go with it.

221
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:12,310
Yes, Mama.

222
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:15,541
But if Jesse steps out of bounds again,
are you gonna be responsible?

223
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,075
Don't forget the buttermilk.

224
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:38,800
Jesse!

225
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,303
Are you all right?
Whoa. Whoa.

226
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:48,870
Sit down. Sit down.

227
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,109
Oh, I'm fine.

228
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:55,244
It's just that Clayton
gets so riled and bothered...

229
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:57,653
about things
that aren't his concern.

230
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:59,714
I- It makes my head swell.

231
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,783
Feelin' a little dizzy?

232
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:04,193
Yes.
Watch my finger.

233
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:07,323
What are you doin'? I'm just
checkin' to see if you're all right.

234
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,925
Since when did you get
a medical degree?

235
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:13,831
Well, I've done some doctoring
in my time.

236
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:18,502
Well, I'll thank you to please keep
your colored voodoo to yourself.

237
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:21,046
Now,

238
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:25,174
if you'd be so kind as to go
and fetch me a glass of lemonade,

239
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:27,242
I'll be just fine.

240
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:46,937
Yes?
I'm so proud of you.

241
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:52,405
You are?
With all my heart.

242
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:55,038
<i>Where's my lemonade, Jesse?</i>

243
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,275
That woman's
gonna run you ragged.

244
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,978
She's not gonna keep you
late, is she? I don't know.

245
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:03,044
Um, let me go take her this,
and I'll find out.

246
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:05,056
Yeah.
Okay.

247
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,794
- I'll be right... I'll be right back.
- Okay.

248
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:15,062
Oh. That your Nell
come to fetch you home?

249
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:17,068
Yeah, I guess so.

250
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:19,434
I meant to get you on that leaky faucet.

251
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:22,338
Keeps me awake all night.

252
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:26,174
Well, you can get on it tomorrow,
first thing. You hear me?

253
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:29,043
I'll do that.

254
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:31,379
You sure you're okay?

255
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,509
I mean, I-I don't like
leaving you alone.

256
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:36,111
You let your granddaughter
take you home.

257
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:38,213
Stop frettin' about me.

258
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:42,192
Besides, Clayton's
comin' back for supper.

259
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:45,361
Good night, Jesse.

260
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:47,422
Good night, Miz Melny.

261
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:03,012
- Well?
- Well, what?

262
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,175
Oh, come on, Papa Jesse.

263
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,412
All the white folks was
flappin' their skinny lips off...

264
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:11,081
about you sittin' down
at Miz Patty's today.

265
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:13,091
It certainly was
the talk of the town.

266
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:15,627
So, what'd it feel like?

267
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:17,560
Like sitting down to eat.

268
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:23,591
It's about time somebody shook up
the white folks in this town,

269
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:26,900
remind them what century
we're livin' in.

270
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,880
I'm gonna sit at that counter
someday...

271
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,011
and I'm gonna drink
from the white fountain and...

272
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:44,079
and ride in the front of the bus...

273
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,283
and do all the things
that make white folks mad.

274
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,417
Is that why you wanna do it,
to make 'em mad?

275
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:52,589
Yep, and 'cause it's right.

276
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,929
You, uh- You always
drive so fast?

277
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:01,666
Of course, Daddy would have a fit
if he knew I was goin'over 35.

278
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:06,075
- But I gotta get you home early so you can cook.
- Cook?

279
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:10,081
Papa Jesse, you goin'
senile on me?

280
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,346
You know you promised to cook
chitlins for the church picnic.

281
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:16,013
<i>I'd heard of chitlins, of course. </i>

282
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:18,079
<i>I thought they were one of those</i>
<i>rare Southern delicacies... </i>

283
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,148
<i>that taste as good as they sound. </i>

284
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:24,026
<i>I never realized</i>
<i>they were pig intestines. </i>

285
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,223
<i>The smell was like something</i>
<i>that had been kept around... </i>

286
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:28,289
<i>too long in autopsy class. </i>

287
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:34,130
I don't care how many times
you two clean them.

288
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:37,937
You'd have to certify me crazy
before I'd eat anybody's chitlins.

289
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,343
No offense, Papa Jesse.
Oh, no offense taken.

290
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,841
I may have
lost my taste for 'em myself.

291
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,913
You okay, Papa Jesse?
You're lookin' a little pale.

292
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:54,416
I'm just a little tired. That's all.

293
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:58,361
Chitlins... and collard greens.
Oh, my God!

294
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:02,196
And fresh-baked corn bread.
"Yumola!"

295
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:06,364
Okay. You're all chopped
and ready, Papa Jesse.

296
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:09,168
You're on your own.
Come on, Mama.

297
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:15,645
Y- You're not gonna help?

298
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,512
I promised Nell
I'd help her finish her dress.

299
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:22,715
And I have to work on my Sunday sermon. But I...

300
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:25,882
You shouldn't have volunteered
if you didn't wanna do it, Papa Jesse.

301
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:30,720
Hey, don't worry about it, pal.

302
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:34,630
I got a killer recipe
for chitlins.

303
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:43,506
You know, this is when
I hate being a hologram.

304
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:47,535
The smell of chitlins and greens cooking
is a religious experience.

305
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,740
I feel like
the Wicked Witch of the West.

306
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:53,342
Let's see. Garlic, onions,
green peppers, celery,

307
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,512
hog maw...
Animal stomach?

308
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,920
Uh- Yeah, chopped finely.

309
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,756
Now, uh, what am I forgetting?
How sick this is making me.

310
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,818
Hey, give me
a little gratitude, will you?

311
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:08,390
Here I am busting my brains off trying to
remember a recipe, and I can't even taste it.

312
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:10,801
Oh, trust me. You'll be
able to taste all you want.

313
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:11,698
That's it! Trust you.

314
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,830
You taste the stock.
Tell me what's missing.

315
00:21:14,907 --> 00:21:17,239
- Are you crazy?
- Not as crazy as you are.

316
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:20,472
Or at least that's what people are gonna say
they see you in here talkin' to yourself.

317
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:23,845
It just kinda helps me think
while I'm cooking.

318
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:27,682
Maybe your being crazy is what happened
to you today at Miz Patty's.

319
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:30,745
What happened? Nothing happened. Nothing at all.

320
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:33,451
Nothin'? Nell said you walked
right in to Miz Patty's,

321
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:37,120
sat down at her lily-white counter
just as bold as you please.

322
00:21:37,196 --> 00:21:39,187
Sam, you didn't?

323
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:43,167
Well, I guess I did.
Papa Jesse,

324
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:45,226
I don't want this family harmed...
Sam, we gotta have a serious talk.

325
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,465
just 'cause you feel it's time
for a bunch of rednecks...

326
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:50,667
to change somethin' they've been
taught since the day they was born.

327
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:53,835
Please.

328
00:21:55,915 --> 00:21:58,076
No more sittin'
at lunch counters.

329
00:22:11,297 --> 00:22:13,788
Needs a little more salt.

330
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:18,593
Night, Daddy.
Good night.

331
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:26,175
Sam. It, uh, needs a little more salt.

332
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:28,236
Sam, you promised me
you would lay low,

333
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:30,942
save Miz Melny and then
leap out of here.

334
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,814
I didn't know I was black!

335
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:36,855
And even if I did, I got a right
to sit at that lunch counter.

336
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:39,550
No, no. In 1955, you didn't.

337
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,559
Well, maybe I should have.
No, Sam.

338
00:22:41,627 --> 00:22:44,187
And maybe that's why I'm here.
No. No, no, no.

339
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:47,232
Ziggy has this "Miz Melny
train wreck" business...

340
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:49,824
computed to a 96. 2% certainty.

341
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:53,963
You're here to save her tomorrow, not to
initiate civil rights activity in the South.

342
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,030
Well, maybe I can do both.

343
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:58,941
You're out of your league, Sam.

344
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:03,580
I sat at that counter
because I was hungry.

345
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:07,983
And everybody went nuts because they saw me
as a black man instead of as a hungry man.

346
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,920
Now, that's wrong. If...
- No!

347
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:15,322
Nell! Nell!
What is it?

348
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:25,034
You've got no right!
No right at all!

349
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:27,937
No right at all.

350
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:37,538
What do you mean
there's no need to do anything?

351
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,709
Well, just that, Jesse.

352
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:42,549
Why don't you just go on home,
you clean up your yard.

353
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:44,612
Let's forget about all this.

354
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,351
But I can identify 'em,
Sheriff.

355
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,655
It was the two called Toad
and Billy Joe.

356
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:51,958
Well, them boys...
You know how boys are, Jesse.

357
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:54,022
They're just being mischievous.

358
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:58,559
I don't think burnin' a cross on somebody's
front lawn is "mischievous, " Sheriff.

359
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:00,571
Is that right?
That's right.

360
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:03,506
Well, you know, maybe you should
have thought about that, Jesse,

361
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:07,636
before you plopped your colored butt
down on a stool over there at Miz Patty's.

362
00:24:07,713 --> 00:24:09,977
What about Billy Joe and Toad?

363
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:13,244
You leave my son to me.

364
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:17,015
Now, I plan to have me a talk
with him and that Toad boy.

365
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:31,363
It doesn't end with this, Sheriff. Well,
that's entirely up to you, Jesse, isn't it?

366
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:33,428
Entirely.

367
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:52,615
Oh, that's it.
He's gone too far.

368
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:56,127
Not here.

369
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:09,767
I don't have a drop of
water in my kitchen.

370
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,833
I can't cook.
I can't wash.

371
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:17,738
Okay.

372
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:22,753
Yeah.
Ah!

373
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:25,153
Oh!

374
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,660
Oh! The pipe is broken.

375
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:33,527
I know the pipe is broken.

376
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:38,095
I'll have to get a new one.

377
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:42,197
Oh, well, I suppose it can wait
till after tea.

378
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:45,299
Come along, Jesse.

379
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,721
Jesse Tyler, what in heaven's name are you doin'?

380
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:06,821
You made tea for us,
so I thought I'd join you.

381
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:08,924
Jesse,

382
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:11,902
somebody has lowered the wick
in your brain.

383
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,666
I make tea for you
every afternoon,

384
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,174
and you have it there
in the kitchen.

385
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,401
Miz Melny, you were kind enough
to make this for me.

386
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:23,607
It just seemed like good manners
to sit with you and share your company.

387
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:27,209
But... I can't have tea
with you, Jesse.

388
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:27,850
Why not?

389
00:26:27,851 --> 00:26:31,518
Coloreds and whites
don't eat at the same table.

390
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,751
If you wanna eat with me,
who says you can't?

391
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:35,759
- I say I can't.
- Why?

392
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:39,593
Well, because
it's the way things are,

393
00:26:39,665 --> 00:26:42,463
the way things
have always been.

394
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:45,401
Maybe it's time they changed.

395
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:48,132
Answer the door, Jesse.

396
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:53,367
Yes, ma'am.

397
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:01,952
Hi, Nell. Oh.

398
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:05,956
I forgot to tell you. I'm gonna
drive Miz Melny's car home tonight.

399
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:08,754
She's gonna let you drive
that old Buick to our place?

400
00:27:10,062 --> 00:27:12,622
Well, I-I gotta work
on the engine.

401
00:27:12,698 --> 00:27:14,757
Papa Jesse, what are you up to?

402
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:18,325
Nothin'. Nothin'. You just go
on, and I'll meet you at supper.

403
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:22,396
Okay. Just as well.
I'm late for choir practice as it is.

404
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,465
Bye.
Bye-bye.

405
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:32,744
Hogwash.

406
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:35,651
Beg pardon?

407
00:27:35,721 --> 00:27:39,213
What you were talkin'
is hogwash.

408
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:41,782
Nobody's gonna change
the way things are.

409
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:45,261
- But they will. Blacks are gonna unite...
- "Blacks"?

410
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,992
Blacks. That's what they'll-

411
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:50,534
That's what we'll be called
instead of "Negroes "

412
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:53,594
What's in God's name's wrong
with being called a niggra?

413
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,197
Maybe it's just a little too close
to "nigger. "

414
00:27:57,576 --> 00:28:02,275
I've never used that word, Jesse,
not to your face or behind your back.

415
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:05,544
When you sat at Miz Patty's counter,
I figured you were...

416
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:09,553
just gettin' old or...
somehow it slipped your mind.

417
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:14,490
But now I think you've gone
just plumb crazy.

418
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,550
I've gone crazy?

419
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:21,191
Miz Melny, I'm not the one burning crosses
in the front of people's homes.

420
00:28:25,771 --> 00:28:29,571
<i>No, no, no
You just got to wait</i>

421
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:32,838
<i>You've gotta trust God
and give him time</i>

422
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:36,506
<i>No matter how long it takes</i>

423
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:42,111
I ain't killin' him.

424
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:46,180
Nevil Pressy had to move to Georgia 'cause of
trying to teach that Blouchette boy a lesson.

425
00:28:46,258 --> 00:28:48,249
Toad, we ain't gonna kill him.

426
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:51,421
We're just gonna whack him
back into place a little bit.

427
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:53,555
<i>Yeah</i>

428
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:57,591
<i>You can't hurry my God
No, no, no</i>

429
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,728
<i>You just got to wait</i>

430
00:28:59,805 --> 00:29:03,002
<i>You've gotta trust God
and give him time</i>

431
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:06,203
<i>No matter how long it takes

432
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:09,179
<i>But he'll be there
Don't you... </i>

433
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,413
Damn niggers! They can't drive
no better than a mule!

434
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:23,018
We better see how bad they're hurt. Now get
in here, man! We gotta get the hell outta here!

435
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,538
The change can be
bloody or peaceful.

436
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:37,302
And you can make the difference
around here. People respect you.

437
00:29:37,376 --> 00:29:39,606
If you change,
so might some of them.

438
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:44,842
The tea's cold.

439
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:50,077
Gonna fix that leak or not?

440
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,050
I'll have to go to town
and get a new pipe.

441
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,460
I'll get my pocketbook.

442
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:02,660
No, no. You can't.
It's too hot today.

443
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:04,725
I'm not gonna melt.

444
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:08,204
Besides, I need to stop at Pratt's
Pharmacy and get some things.

445
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:11,242
I'll get 'em.
They're personal.

446
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,243
Well...
Look, Miz Melny,

447
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:17,475
I- I think that I can fix that leak, you know,
without getting a new pipe.

448
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:19,710
All right. I'll drive myself. No.

449
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:27,581
If you're that set on going,
I'll drive you.

450
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,492
Just let me get my... coat.

451
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:36,499
<i>I had a knot in my stomach
the size of Ziggy's control mouse. </i>

452
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:39,002
<i>Even though we were driving</i>
<i>away from the tracks, </i>

453
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,664
<i>away from the train</i>
<i>and away from Miz Melny's fate, </i>

454
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,674
<i>it wouldn't go away. </i>

455
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:50,613
Oh, my Lord!
Isn't that your Willis's car?

456
00:31:05,297 --> 00:31:07,492
Nell!

457
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:16,672
- Is she all right?
- She has a severe laceration.

458
00:31:16,741 --> 00:31:20,370
- I've gotta stop the hemorrhaging.
- Oh, Jesse!

459
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:36,050
Miz Melny, get back in the car.

460
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:46,428
Oh, Jesse, there's so much blood.

461
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:48,496
We gotta get her to a hospital.

462
00:31:49,975 --> 00:31:53,069
- Hurry, Jesse!
- Keep pressure on it, Miz Melny.

463
00:32:09,528 --> 00:32:12,122
You'll be fine, child, just fine.

464
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:16,307
Where you goin', Jesse?

465
00:32:16,308 --> 00:32:18,368
To the hospital on the
other side of the cemetery.

466
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:21,064
Legada?
That's a white hospital.

467
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:23,573
- Colored hospital is in Vida.
- Which is closest?

468
00:32:23,642 --> 00:32:27,100
- Legada, but they won't take her, Jesse.
- The hell they won't.

469
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:56,631
Get me a doctor and a gurney!
Quick!

470
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,642
Oh, she's cold.
We're gonna fix that.

471
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:08,284
She's in shock, lost a lot of blood.
I think she severed a temporal artery.

472
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:12,756
She'll need a transfusion and a...
What are you waiting for?

473
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:15,384
We don't accept colored here.
I'm sorry.

474
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,293
You're gonna be a hell of a lot sorrier if
you don't help me. And I mean right now!

475
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:20,854
I'll call the sheriff. I can't
help her. It's against the law.

476
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:23,366
To hell with the law.

477
00:33:23,435 --> 00:33:25,869
Aren't you Delia Parker's son?

478
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:30,568
- Yes, ma'am.
- Well, you know who I am.

479
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:32,576
Yes, Miz Trafford.

480
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:35,703
I want you to help that child.

481
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:44,912
Let's get her inside.

482
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:50,050
Get an I. V.
and a cross match.

483
00:33:51,296 --> 00:33:53,287
Jesse.

484
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,968
I think you best
stay out here.

485
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,265
I'll see she's taken care of.

486
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:20,822
- I don't know how you pulled it off.
- It was Miz Melny.

487
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,883
She got that bigoted idiot
to do something.

488
00:34:22,961 --> 00:34:25,759
Now, Sam, uh, why don't you
get Miz Melny right now,

489
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:28,025
put her in the car
and drive away from here?

490
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:30,090
Why?
"Why"?

491
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:32,261
You got 23 minutes,
or that train is gonna hit her.

492
00:34:32,337 --> 00:34:34,328
So I should get in the car
and start driving? Yeah.

493
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:36,340
Crossing's that way.
You go that way.

494
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:38,774
Al, you're getting
a little paranoid.

495
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:41,073
Sam, how do you think
I lived this long?

496
00:34:41,146 --> 00:34:43,137
Sam, I'm not kidding you.

497
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:45,239
I've got a bad feeling
about this one.

498
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:47,546
You always have a bad feel...

499
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:51,787
I knew it, Sam.
Damn it. I knew it.

500
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,753
He's the one, Sheriff.

501
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:01,822
Jesse.

502
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:05,598
I thought I warned you
about causing any more trouble.

503
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:10,164
All I did was bring a girl here
who needed medical assistance.

504
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:12,232
A niggra girl.

505
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:15,742
That's breakin'
the segregation law, Jesse.

506
00:35:15,814 --> 00:35:18,282
What was I supposed to do, Sheriff,
just let her bleed to death?

507
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:20,544
No, I-I reckon not.

508
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:23,746
"No, I reckon not" is right.

509
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:26,450
- What are you doing, Sheriff?
- Sam, you gotta get out of this.

510
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:27,432
Look, I'm trying.

511
00:35:27,433 --> 00:35:29,823
He's crazy as a loon,
Sheriff. Talks to himself.

512
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:32,829
Look, Sheriff...
You just ease up here, Jesse,

513
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:34,888
or I might have
to get rough with you.

514
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,457
Okay, okay. Okay.

515
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:41,665
- Just on-nn one condition.
- What's that?

516
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,368
Don't let Miz Melny leave here,
even if she wants to,

517
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:47,104
- for, uh...
- Twenty minutes.

518
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:49,772
Uh, half hour.

519
00:35:49,848 --> 00:35:52,009
- Why?
- Does it matter?

520
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:58,479
- You got that, Ethel?
- Yes, sir.

521
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:00,854
Okay?

522
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:03,416
Okay.

523
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:16,096
Jesse?
Nell's gonna be just fine.

524
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,870
Oh, thank God.

525
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:21,878
- Where's Jesse?
- The sheriff arrested him.

526
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:24,210
Yeah. Pig butt here
turned him in.

527
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:26,443
Arrested? For what?

528
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:29,746
Bringin' that niggra here.

529
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:31,812
Well, he's just gonna
have to arrest me.

530
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:35,621
- Oh, they wouldn't do that.
- Miz Trafford!

531
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:38,025
Sheriff Blount said
you was to wait here.

532
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:42,533
Did he?
Well, he's in for a surprise.

533
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,763
Attagirl. Oh, no, no, no!
No. I take that back.

534
00:36:45,837 --> 00:36:48,863
Uh, no, no, no, no. No, you
can't do that, Miz Melny.

535
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,909
Miz Melny, uh- Uh-
Oh, God, Sam!

536
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:54,570
Please have the car keys
in your pocket.

537
00:36:57,315 --> 00:37:00,409
Uh- Uh, Miz Melny, uh,
we got a real...

538
00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:03,249
We got a problem...
Oh, she can't hear me.

539
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:06,290
Uh, no, no. Don't back up.
Uh- Uh, Miz Melny?

540
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:08,348
Uh- Oh, what am I gonna do?

541
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:10,826
No. Uh- Uh, Miz Melny.

542
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,886
Now, uh, you should
wait for Jesse.

543
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:14,989
The sheriff said
to wait 30 minutes.

544
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,000
Damn!

545
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,366
Miz Melny, stop.
Stop, stop, stop!

546
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:22,372
Stop! Stop!
Never mind.

547
00:37:29,781 --> 00:37:33,410
Gooshie. Tell Ziggy
to center me in on Miz Melny.

548
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:38,616
Do it, Gooshie, damn it!
Or I'll smash your brains off!.

549
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:45,928
Arrestin' Jesse
for carin' for his own!

550
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:48,158
Oh, I wish you were here, Charles.

551
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:50,895
- You always did know what to do.
- So do I.

552
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:54,217
And what you have to do,
Miz Melny, is stop the car.

553
00:37:54,218 --> 00:37:55,565
Am I in the right gear?

554
00:38:01,546 --> 00:38:03,537
Charles, it's been so long.

555
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:05,606
Uh, reverse. You'd be better off
in reverse, Miz Melny.

556
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:08,618
Well, what difference does it make?
As long as we get there.

557
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:11,553
But-But you're not going
to get there, Miz Melny.

558
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:20,020
Better late than never.
Than never.

559
00:38:20,098 --> 00:38:23,124
And it's going to be never, Miz Melny,
unless you stop the car!

560
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:28,839
That awful ringin' again.

561
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:33,003
It's not ringing, Miz Melny. It's
a train whistle. A train whistle!

562
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,838
I suppose I should
visit Dr. Clifford,

563
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:40,316
but I never did care
for his bedside manner.

564
00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:48,121
Miz Melny, I am ordering you to
stop this car! Peace and quiet.

565
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:53,088
You have to hear that whistle!

566
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,299
The cemetery.

567
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:01,429
- Pull off into the cemetery!
- The wrong gear.

568
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:06,708
Pull off into the cemetery,
damn it!

569
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:21,315
Thank you, Charles.

570
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:24,484
You didn't have to swear.

571
00:39:33,004 --> 00:39:36,496
It was incredible.
Real twilight zone stuff.

572
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:39,270
Sam, she had
to have heard me.

573
00:39:39,344 --> 00:39:41,744
That's great, Al.
Just think of the possibilities.

574
00:39:41,813 --> 00:39:46,250
I mean, if I reached Miz Melny,
then maybe-just maybe...

575
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:49,242
I can reach other women.

576
00:39:50,922 --> 00:39:53,288
Younger women.

577
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:58,295
What?

578
00:39:58,363 --> 00:40:01,059
Is sex all you ever think about?

579
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:05,660
Well, except when I'm pulling you
out of the fire, yes.

580
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:08,228
Yeah.

581
00:40:08,306 --> 00:40:11,241
Well, you got me there, Al.

582
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:15,678
Oh, I forgot to tell you. Ziggy
finally came up with some data on Jesse.

583
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:18,375
What happened to him?
Nothing happened to him.

584
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:21,885
He's still alive in our time. The guy
must be, I don't know, 105 years old.

585
00:40:21,953 --> 00:40:24,922
Isn't that a kick in the butt? That's great.

586
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:28,649
Well, then, why am I here?

587
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:32,628
I mean, Miz Melny's alive.
I'm alive.

588
00:40:32,697 --> 00:40:35,165
Why haven't I leaped?
Oh, I...

589
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:38,733
Well, maybe we're gonna find out. Jesse.

590
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:45,575
Miz Melny persuaded me to
drop the charges against you.

591
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:48,043
- I talked to the hospital this mornin...
- How's Nell?

592
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:51,548
She's fine. They say she’s gonna
be just fine. Don't you worry none.

593
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:55,518
She, uh-he told them
how this, uh,

594
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:57,577
accident happened.

595
00:40:57,655 --> 00:40:59,646
Well, seems like
a couple of the boys,

596
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:02,716
they sort of...
run her off the road.

597
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:06,491
- They didn't mean to hurt her none.
- Well, what did they mean to do, Sheriff?

598
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:09,158
Well, I suppose maybe they thought
you were in that car, Jesse.

599
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:12,600
I mean, you have been actin' mighty
strange around here lately.

600
00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:16,332
- Maybe they just wanted to...
- To what, Sheriff?

601
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:18,341
Maybe teach me a lesson?

602
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:20,604
Well, there ain't nobody
gonna be, uh,

603
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:23,340
botherin' you
or any of yours again.

604
00:41:24,449 --> 00:41:26,474
I give you my word on that.

605
00:41:26,551 --> 00:41:29,076
It's not good enough, Sheriff.

606
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:32,486
Just take it easy, Sam.
It's going to happen.

607
00:41:32,557 --> 00:41:36,152
Damn it, Jesse! Now, I'm telling you
them boys is sorry.

608
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:38,627
Four months from today,
What boys, Sheriff?

609
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:41,130
Rosa Parks
and Martin Luther King...

610
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:44,327
- I've said all I'm sayin...
- Are gonna start the Montgomery boycotts.

611
00:41:44,402 --> 00:41:48,361
Now you better just get on outta here,
Jesse, before I change my mind. Go on.

612
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:58,638
You're gonna have to change your mind
about a lot of things, Sheriff.

613
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:09,983
I'll see ya, Al.

614
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:23,068
<i>Deep in</i>

615
00:42:23,141 --> 00:42:26,406
<i>My heart</i>

616
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:29,742
<i>I do</i>

617
00:42:29,814 --> 00:42:32,806
<i>Believe</i>

618
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:35,853
<i>That we shall</i>

619
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,287
<i>Overcome</i>

620
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:43,988
<i>Someday</i>

621
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:01,270
I'm glad to see you got home safely,
Miz Melny.

622
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:04,337
No thanks to you, goin' out
and gettin' yourself arrested.

623
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,406
Well, I-I won't let it
happen again.

624
00:43:06,484 --> 00:43:08,679
If it was up to me,
you'd still be in jail.

625
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:10,744
It's not up to you.

626
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:13,016
Mama, Jesse is just usin' you.
If you can't see that...

627
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:17,584
My relationship with Mr. Tyler
is my business.

628
00:43:17,662 --> 00:43:20,096
Now you go mind yours,
and I'll see you for supper.

629
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:23,523
Yes, ma'am.

630
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:29,065
- Thank you.
- Sometimes I think they switched babies on me.

631
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:31,370
No. No, I mean...
Not about Clayton.

632
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,501
I mean, thank you...

633
00:43:33,578 --> 00:43:35,569
for doing what you did for Nell
at the hospital.

634
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:39,377
Why, I was glad to do it, Jesse,
and she's doin' fine.

635
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:42,510
They moved her to Vida this mornin'. Moved her?

636
00:43:42,587 --> 00:43:44,953
She was in critical condition.
A move could've killed her.

637
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:47,889
Well, it didn't, and she's fine...

638
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,950
and she's with her own people.

639
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:52,222
And that is the way
it's supposed to be.

640
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:58,064
Now, let's both of us try to forget
all about this horrible business...

641
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,126
and let things
get back to normal.

642
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:03,173
How can your life go back to normal
after yesterday?

643
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:06,733
Miz Melny, you can't have done what
you did without it opening your eyes.

644
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:10,508
To what? To the fact
that the world isn't just?

645
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:13,573
I knew that, Jesse.

646
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,642
But my knowin' it
doesn't change it.

647
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,188
You changed it yesterday,
and you can change it today.

648
00:44:18,256 --> 00:44:20,417
If you want to go off
and change the world,

649
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,721
you're welcome to it.

650
00:44:22,793 --> 00:44:25,853
But if you want to work for me,

651
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:29,263
we will close this conversation
forever.

652
00:44:31,569 --> 00:44:35,596
Now, please go over
to Miz Patty's...

653
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,664
and pick up my lunch.

654
00:44:38,743 --> 00:44:41,473
Miz Melny,
once you've seen the light,

655
00:44:41,545 --> 00:44:43,706
you cannot go back
into the darkness.

656
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:47,717
Get my egg salad.
Jesse.

657
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:52,182
Yes, ma'am.

658
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:07,894
There's the jailbird.

659
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:17,245
You here to pick up
Miz Melny's lunch, Jesse?

660
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:21,510
I guess I am.

661
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:31,424
Thank you, Miz Patty.
Never mind, Jesse.

662
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:33,486
I've decided to eat it here.

663
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:38,157
Good afternoon, Miz Trafford. Nice to
see you, ma'am. Nice to see you today.

664
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:41,227
- How are you, Miz Patty?
- Just fine, ma'am.

665
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:43,705
Would you like something
to drink with the egg salad?

666
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:45,799
Some of your lemonade
would be just fine.

667
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:47,537
All right.

668
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:51,575
Oh, Jesse.

669
00:45:51,649 --> 00:45:54,846
Will you join me for lunch?

670
00:46:04,829 --> 00:46:06,820
Sit down.
Just sit down.

671
00:46:11,569 --> 00:46:13,560
Yes, ma'am, I guess I will.

672
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:01,076
Oh, boy.
