00:00:47,193 --> 00:00:49,252
(HEART BEATING)

2
00:00:49,462 --> 00:00:53,057
SAGAN: There is one experience
that every human shares...

3
00:00:53,265 --> 00:00:55,529
...of every language and culture:

4
00:00:55,734 --> 00:00:57,759
The experience of birth.

5
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,899
Our recollections of birth are
hazy at best.

6
00:01:02,107 --> 00:01:06,476
They have the feel and aura
not so much of memories...

7
00:01:06,679 --> 00:01:10,877
...as of mystical transfigurations.

8
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:15,019
It would be astonishing if
this profound early experience...

9
00:01:15,221 --> 00:01:17,815
...did not influence
our myths and religions...

10
00:01:18,023 --> 00:01:20,719
...our philosophy and our science.

11
00:01:20,926 --> 00:01:25,727
The birth of a child evokes
the mystery of other origins...

12
00:01:25,931 --> 00:01:28,422
...the beginnings and ends
of worlds...

13
00:01:28,701 --> 00:01:31,932
...infinity and eternity.

14
00:01:33,138 --> 00:01:38,075
How did the universe arise?

15
00:01:38,911 --> 00:01:42,005
What was around before that?

16
00:01:42,848 --> 00:01:45,476
Might there have been no beginning?

17
00:01:45,684 --> 00:01:49,415
Could the universe be infinitely old?

18
00:01:49,622 --> 00:01:53,149
Are there boundaries to the cosmos?

19
00:01:53,526 --> 00:01:56,791
The current scientific story
of the origin of the universe...

20
00:01:57,029 --> 00:02:01,398
...begins with an explosion
which made space itself expand.

21
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,397
About 15 billion years ago...

22
00:02:03,602 --> 00:02:07,038
...all the matter and energy that
make up the observable universe...

23
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:11,835
...were concentrated into a space
smaller than the head of a pin.

24
00:02:12,044 --> 00:02:16,777
The cosmos blew apart in one
inconceivably colossal explosion:

25
00:02:16,982 --> 00:02:18,210
The big bang.

26
00:02:18,484 --> 00:02:22,716
The stuff of the universe, together
with the fabric of space itself...

27
00:02:22,922 --> 00:02:26,585
...began expanding in all directions
as they do today.

28
00:02:26,792 --> 00:02:29,727
We can visualize this process
with a three-dimensional grid...

29
00:02:29,929 --> 00:02:33,524
...attached to the expanding fabric
of space.

30
00:02:35,134 --> 00:02:38,729
The early cosmos was
everywhere white-hot.

31
00:02:38,938 --> 00:02:42,169
But as time passed,
the radiation expanded and cooled...

32
00:02:42,374 --> 00:02:46,606
...and in ordinarily visible light,
space became dark as it is today.

33
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:50,940
But then little pockets of gas
began to grow.

34
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,914
Tendrils of gossamer clouds formed...

35
00:02:54,119 --> 00:02:58,385
...colonies of great, lumbering,
slowly spinning things...

36
00:02:58,591 --> 00:03:01,924
...steadily brightening,
each a kind of beast...

37
00:03:02,127 --> 00:03:05,563
...composed of a hundred billion
shining points.

38
00:03:09,201 --> 00:03:13,501
The largest recognizable structures
in the universe had formed.

39
00:03:13,706 --> 00:03:18,040
We see them today. We ourselves
inhabit some lost corner of one.

40
00:03:18,243 --> 00:03:20,643
We call them the galaxies.

41
00:03:20,846 --> 00:03:23,314
We inhabit a universe of galaxies.

42
00:03:23,515 --> 00:03:27,713
There are unstructured blobs,
the irregular galaxies...

43
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,787
...globular or elliptical galaxies...

44
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:35,290
...and the graceful blue arms
of spiral galaxies.

45
00:03:36,261 --> 00:03:38,161
We've been investigating
the galaxies...

46
00:03:38,364 --> 00:03:42,630
...their origins, evolution and
motions for less than a century.

47
00:03:42,835 --> 00:03:45,497
These studies extend
our understanding...

48
00:03:45,704 --> 00:03:48,764
...to the farthest reaches
of the universe.

49
00:03:50,843 --> 00:03:55,473
Our ship of the imagination carries us
to that ultimate frontier.

50
00:03:55,681 --> 00:03:59,276
We view the cosmos
on the grandest of scales.

51
00:03:59,485 --> 00:04:03,922
The majesty of the galaxies
is revealed by science.

52
00:04:04,723 --> 00:04:08,955
There are many different ways in which
stars are arrayed into galaxies.

53
00:04:12,531 --> 00:04:16,968
When, by chance, the face of a spiral
galaxy is turned toward us...

54
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:22,106
...we see the spiral arms,
made luminous by billions of stars.

55
00:04:22,307 --> 00:04:26,869
When, in other cases, the edge
of a galaxy is towards us...

56
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:29,309
...we see the central lanes
of gas and dust...

57
00:04:29,515 --> 00:04:31,813
...from which the stars are forming.

58
00:04:33,652 --> 00:04:37,418
In barred spirals,
a river of star stuff...

59
00:04:37,623 --> 00:04:39,853
...extends through
the galactic center...

60
00:04:40,059 --> 00:04:42,960
...connecting opposite spiral arms.

61
00:04:43,696 --> 00:04:48,633
Elliptical galaxies come
in giant and dwarf sizes.

62
00:04:51,303 --> 00:04:53,328
There are many mysterious galaxies...

63
00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:56,508
...places where something has gone
terribly wrong...

64
00:04:56,709 --> 00:04:58,870
...where there are
explosions and collisions...

65
00:04:59,078 --> 00:05:02,047
...and streamers of gas and stars...

66
00:05:02,247 --> 00:05:05,375
...bridges between the galaxies.

67
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:10,250
The galaxies look rigid, unmoving.

68
00:05:10,456 --> 00:05:14,085
But we see them only for
a single frame of the cosmic movie.

69
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:17,626
Their parts are dissipating
and reforming...

70
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,799
...on a time scale of
hundreds of millions of years.

71
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:25,095
A galaxy is a fluid made
of billions of suns...

72
00:05:25,304 --> 00:05:28,273
...all bound together by gravity.

73
00:05:29,108 --> 00:05:33,010
These giant galactic forms exist
throughout the universe...

74
00:05:33,212 --> 00:05:36,704
...and may be a common source
of wonderment and instruction...

75
00:05:36,915 --> 00:05:40,146
...for billions of species
of intelligent life.

76
00:05:43,922 --> 00:05:48,859
Their evolution is governed everywhere
by the same laws of physics.

77
00:05:52,898 --> 00:05:54,991
We need a computer to illustrate...

78
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,566
...the collective motion
of so many stars...

79
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:01,900
...each under the gravitational
influence of all the others.

80
00:06:05,744 --> 00:06:10,681
A billion years is here compressed
into a few seconds.

81
00:06:13,485 --> 00:06:18,422
In some cases, spiral arms form
all by themselves.

82
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:28,996
In other cases...

83
00:06:29,201 --> 00:06:32,693
...the close gravitational encounter
of two galaxies...

84
00:06:32,905 --> 00:06:36,534
...will draw out spiral arms.

85
00:06:42,548 --> 00:06:45,745
But when two nearby galaxies
collide...

86
00:06:45,951 --> 00:06:48,647
...like a bullet through
a swarm of bees...

87
00:06:48,854 --> 00:06:50,788
...the stars hardly collide at all.

88
00:06:50,989 --> 00:06:55,892
But the shapes of the galaxies
can be severely distorted.

89
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:05,295
A direct collision of two galaxies can
last a hundred million years...

90
00:07:05,537 --> 00:07:08,097
...and spill the constituent stars...

91
00:07:08,307 --> 00:07:11,868
...careening through
intergalactic space.

92
00:07:13,912 --> 00:07:18,406
When a dense, compact galaxy runs
into a larger one face-on...

93
00:07:18,617 --> 00:07:21,984
...it can produce one of the loveliest
of the rare irregulars:

94
00:07:22,187 --> 00:07:24,246
A ring galaxy.

95
00:07:32,898 --> 00:07:35,230
Thousands of light-years across...

96
00:07:35,434 --> 00:07:37,732
...a ring galaxy is set...

97
00:07:37,936 --> 00:07:41,531
...against the velvet
of intergalactic space.

98
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:49,844
It's a temporary configuration
of disrupted stars...

99
00:07:50,048 --> 00:07:53,347
...a splash in the cosmic pond.

100
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:02,359
Galaxies sometimes blow themselves up.

101
00:08:02,594 --> 00:08:06,496
The quasars, probably billions
of light-years away...

102
00:08:06,698 --> 00:08:10,293
...may be the colossal explosions
of young galaxies.

103
00:08:10,502 --> 00:08:11,833
But we're not sure.

104
00:08:12,037 --> 00:08:15,666
Quasars are a mystery still.

105
00:08:19,945 --> 00:08:24,314
The galaxies reveal
a universal order, beauty...

106
00:08:24,516 --> 00:08:29,044
...but also violence on a scale
never before imagined.

107
00:08:29,321 --> 00:08:33,189
The universe seems neither
benign nor hostile...

108
00:08:33,392 --> 00:08:38,329
...merely indifferent to the concerns
of such creatures as we.

109
00:08:41,934 --> 00:08:45,836
Quasars may be monster versions
of rapidly rotating pulsars...

110
00:08:46,038 --> 00:08:48,905
...or due to multiple collisions
of millions of stars...

111
00:08:49,107 --> 00:08:51,905
...densely packed
in the galactic core...

112
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:57,047
...or a chain reaction of supernova
explosions in such a core.

113
00:08:59,518 --> 00:09:03,181
Some astronomers think a quasar is
caused by millions of stars...

114
00:09:03,422 --> 00:09:07,688
...falling into an immense black hole
in the core of a galaxy.

115
00:09:07,926 --> 00:09:09,689
Something like a black hole...

116
00:09:09,928 --> 00:09:14,422
...something very massive,
very dense and very small...

117
00:09:14,633 --> 00:09:17,625
...is ticking and purring away...

118
00:09:17,836 --> 00:09:20,999
...in the cores of nearby galaxies.

119
00:09:30,082 --> 00:09:33,540
Even a well-behaved galaxy
like the Milky Way...

120
00:09:33,752 --> 00:09:37,483
...has its stirrings and its dances.

121
00:09:39,024 --> 00:09:43,051
The stars of the Milky Way move
with systematic grace.

122
00:09:43,261 --> 00:09:46,560
The sun takes 250 million years...

123
00:09:46,798 --> 00:09:49,323
...to go once around the core.

124
00:09:50,135 --> 00:09:52,160
The outer provinces of the galaxy...

125
00:09:52,371 --> 00:09:55,135
...revolve more slowly
than the inner regions.

126
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:59,504
As a result, gas and dust
pile up in spiral patterns.

127
00:09:59,711 --> 00:10:02,373
These places of greater density
are where...

128
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:04,640
...young, hot, bright stars form...

129
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:07,544
...the stars which outline
the spiral arms.

130
00:10:07,753 --> 00:10:11,348
These hot stars shine for only
10 million years or so...

131
00:10:11,556 --> 00:10:14,389
...and then blow up.

132
00:10:15,961 --> 00:10:19,260
But as the stars which outline
a spiral arm burn out...

133
00:10:19,498 --> 00:10:22,558
...new, young stars are formed
from the debris just behind them...

134
00:10:22,768 --> 00:10:25,794
...and the spiral pattern persists.

135
00:10:27,939 --> 00:10:29,907
The sun, marked here with a circle...

136
00:10:30,108 --> 00:10:32,906
...has been in and out
of spiral arms often...

137
00:10:33,111 --> 00:10:35,602
...in the 20 times it has
gone around the Milky Way.

138
00:10:35,814 --> 00:10:40,148
In this epoch, we live
at the edge of a spiral arm.

139
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:48,858
We've looked at internal galactic
motion on a small scale...

140
00:10:49,061 --> 00:10:51,655
...across a million light-years
or less.

141
00:10:51,863 --> 00:10:54,525
But the motion of the galaxies
themselves...

142
00:10:54,733 --> 00:10:57,793
...across billions of light-years
is different.

143
00:10:58,003 --> 00:11:02,030
That motion is a relic
of the big bang.

144
00:11:02,974 --> 00:11:06,341
The key to cosmology,
the study of the entire universe...

145
00:11:06,545 --> 00:11:08,843
...turns out to be
a commonplace of nature...

146
00:11:09,047 --> 00:11:12,346
...an experience of everyday life.

147
00:11:16,955 --> 00:11:19,822
Imagine a moving object
sending out waves.

148
00:11:20,025 --> 00:11:21,925
It could be light waves...

149
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,184
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

150
00:11:23,395 --> 00:11:27,092
...it could be sound waves,
it could be any kind of wave.

151
00:11:32,104 --> 00:11:34,231
When that moving object passes us...

152
00:11:34,439 --> 00:11:37,101
...we sense a change in pitch.

153
00:11:37,342 --> 00:11:40,709
That's called the Doppler effect.

154
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:45,846
If you're the engineer in the cab...

155
00:11:46,051 --> 00:11:49,384
...the pitch of the whistle
always sounds the same to you.

156
00:11:49,621 --> 00:11:53,580
That's because you're moving along
with the source of the sound.

157
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:57,119
But if you're standing alongside
the track when the train passes...

158
00:11:57,329 --> 00:12:00,230
...you hear that familiar
shift in pitch:

159
00:12:00,465 --> 00:12:02,330
The Doppler shift.

160
00:12:07,939 --> 00:12:10,407
The reason this happens
is easy to understand...

161
00:12:10,609 --> 00:12:13,305
...once you visualize the waves.

162
00:12:14,012 --> 00:12:17,140
A stationary train sends out
sound waves in perfect circles...

163
00:12:17,349 --> 00:12:19,647
...like the ripples on a pond.

164
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,715
Let's start the train again.

165
00:12:28,193 --> 00:12:32,220
Now, the waves spreading out ahead
of it get squashed together...

166
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,092
...and those spreading out behind it
get stretched apart.

167
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:38,234
The compressed waves have
a higher frequency or pitch...

168
00:12:38,436 --> 00:12:40,404
...than the stretched-out waves.

169
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,840
The same thing is true
for light waves.

170
00:12:44,042 --> 00:12:47,842
Color is to light
precisely what pitch is to sound.

171
00:12:48,446 --> 00:12:51,210
Compressed light waves are made bluer.
They're blue-shifted.

172
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:55,182
Stretched-out light waves are
made redder. They're red-shifted.

173
00:12:57,889 --> 00:12:59,151
At the speed of a train...

174
00:12:59,357 --> 00:13:02,986
...you can sense the change of pitch
for sound, but not for light.

175
00:13:03,195 --> 00:13:07,131
The train is traveling about
a million times too slow for that.

176
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:15,403
It turns out that the Doppler effect
for light waves...

177
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,541
...is the key to the cosmos.

178
00:13:20,145 --> 00:13:22,807
The evidence for this was
gathered unexpectedly...

179
00:13:23,014 --> 00:13:27,883
...by a former mule-team driver
who never went beyond the eighth grade.

180
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,885
During the second decade
of this century...

181
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:34,581
...the world's largest telescope was
being assembled on Mount Wilson...

182
00:13:34,826 --> 00:13:39,160
...overlooking what were then
the clear skies of Los Angeles.

183
00:13:39,864 --> 00:13:43,300
Large pieces of the telescope were
hauled to the mountaintop...

184
00:13:43,501 --> 00:13:45,901
...a job for mule teams.

185
00:13:48,873 --> 00:13:52,331
One of the drivers was
a young man named Milton Humason...

186
00:13:52,544 --> 00:13:56,207
...the ne'er-do-well son
of a California banker.

187
00:13:56,448 --> 00:13:59,315
But he was bright and naturally
curious about the equipment...

188
00:13:59,517 --> 00:14:01,314
...he had carted up Mount Wilson.

189
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,784
And after the telescope was
completed in 1917...

190
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:09,051
...he managed to stay on here
as janitor and electrician.

191
00:14:10,128 --> 00:14:13,996
One evening, so the story goes, the
observatory night assistant was ill.

192
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:16,827
Humason was asked to fill in.

193
00:14:23,942 --> 00:14:25,807
Humason was a gambling man...

194
00:14:26,011 --> 00:14:29,538
...celebrated for his skill at poker
and at the pool table.

195
00:14:29,748 --> 00:14:33,980
But his touch with the telescope was
admired even more.

196
00:14:34,252 --> 00:14:37,585
He discovered he had a talent
for using astronomical instruments.

197
00:14:37,822 --> 00:14:42,088
He became the virtuoso
of the 100-inch telescope.

198
00:14:43,428 --> 00:14:45,862
In this instrument,
light from distant galaxies...

199
00:14:46,064 --> 00:14:48,430
...is focused on
a glass photographic plate...

200
00:14:48,633 --> 00:14:52,660
...by a great encased mirror
100 inches across.

201
00:14:54,239 --> 00:14:58,141
By the late 1920s, Humason was
making observations himself.

202
00:14:58,343 --> 00:15:00,174
Mr. Nelson?

203
00:15:00,378 --> 00:15:02,972
NELSON:
I'm in the coud? room, sir.

204
00:15:07,986 --> 00:15:10,546
SAGAN: Humason by now had
his own night assistant...

205
00:15:10,789 --> 00:15:13,189
...to help him with the observations.

206
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,195
HUMASON: Afternoon, Mr. Nelson.
-Good afternoon, Mr. Humason.

207
00:15:18,663 --> 00:15:20,028
We'll start at 6.

208
00:15:20,231 --> 00:15:23,132
I'll be making a spectrogram
at the Cassegrain focus.

209
00:15:23,335 --> 00:15:24,700
Yes, sir.

210
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:28,996
SAGAN: The telescope must be able
to point with high accuracy...

211
00:15:29,207 --> 00:15:33,371
...to a designated region of the sky,
and to keep on pointing there.

212
00:15:34,913 --> 00:15:38,815
A machine weighing about 75 tons,
as massive as a locomotive...

213
00:15:39,017 --> 00:15:42,783
...must move with a precision greater
than that of the finest pocket watch.

214
00:15:47,292 --> 00:15:50,386
Everything must be checked
thoroughly.

215
00:15:55,266 --> 00:15:59,134
The electrical power system
must work flawlessly.

216
00:16:06,511 --> 00:16:10,174
Hours before observations are
to begin, the dome is opened...

217
00:16:10,382 --> 00:16:14,284
...to allow the temperature inside
and outside to be equalized.

218
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:24,392
Humason prepared the sensitive
photographic emulsions...

219
00:16:24,596 --> 00:16:26,621
...sheathed in their metal holders...

220
00:16:26,831 --> 00:16:28,856
...to capture with
the giant telescope...

221
00:16:29,067 --> 00:16:32,298
...the faint light
from remote galaxies.

222
00:16:33,605 --> 00:16:36,130
This was part of
a systematic program...

223
00:16:36,341 --> 00:16:40,471
...which Humason and his mentor,
the astronomer Edwin Hubble...

224
00:16:40,678 --> 00:16:42,976
...were pursuing to measure
the Doppler shift...

225
00:16:43,181 --> 00:16:46,446
...of light from the most distant
galaxies then known.

226
00:16:50,388 --> 00:16:53,152
But the most distant galaxies are
very faint.

227
00:16:53,358 --> 00:16:56,418
That's why even with the largest
telescope in the world...

228
00:16:56,628 --> 00:16:59,722
...it was necessary to take very long
time exposures...

229
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:01,262
...often lasting all night...

230
00:17:01,466 --> 00:17:04,492
...and sometimes requiring
several successive nights.

231
00:17:06,204 --> 00:17:09,765
Humason would give the night assistant
the celestial coordinates...

232
00:17:09,974 --> 00:17:11,874
...of the target galaxy.

233
00:17:20,985 --> 00:17:24,614
Through the long, cold night,
he'd have to make fine adjustments...

234
00:17:24,823 --> 00:17:28,486
...so the telescope would precisely
track the target galaxy.

235
00:17:28,693 --> 00:17:32,060
The galaxy itself was too faint
to see through the telescope...

236
00:17:32,297 --> 00:17:34,891
...although it could be recorded
photographically...

237
00:17:35,133 --> 00:17:36,498
...with a long time exposure.

238
00:17:38,036 --> 00:17:41,563
So the telescope would be pointed
at a nearby bright star...

239
00:17:41,773 --> 00:17:45,573
...and then offset to
a featureless patch of sky...

240
00:17:45,844 --> 00:17:47,812
...from which, over the long night...

241
00:17:48,012 --> 00:17:51,846
...the light from the unseen galaxy
would slowly accumulate.

242
00:17:52,951 --> 00:17:55,579
The telescope focused the faint
light from a galaxy...

243
00:17:55,787 --> 00:17:57,084
...into the spectrometer...

244
00:17:57,288 --> 00:18:01,281
...where it was spread out into
its rainbow of constituent colors.

245
00:18:01,493 --> 00:18:05,429
The spectrum would be recorded on
the little glass plates.

246
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:09,361
Would you clamp in the drive and slue
to the focus star, please?

247
00:18:10,335 --> 00:18:11,495
Are you clear?

248
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:15,633
NELSON: I'm going to slue to the east.
-Yes. I think I'm clear.

249
00:18:16,307 --> 00:18:18,298
HUMASON:
Just take it easy.

250
00:18:37,529 --> 00:18:39,053
All right, I have it.

251
00:18:40,331 --> 00:18:43,630
Now, let's go to NGC 7-6-1-9.

252
00:18:43,835 --> 00:18:45,268
I'm clear.

253
00:18:48,873 --> 00:18:51,774
Going to do a 10-hour exposure.

254
00:18:55,013 --> 00:18:56,173
What time is it?

255
00:18:56,381 --> 00:18:58,212
7:15.

256
00:18:58,449 --> 00:18:59,848
HUMASON:
Lights out, please.

257
00:19:05,256 --> 00:19:07,486
The dark slide is open.

258
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:22,872
SAGAN: A large telescope views
only a tiny patch of sky.

259
00:19:23,107 --> 00:19:26,474
As the Earth turns,
a guide star or a galaxy...

260
00:19:26,678 --> 00:19:30,705
...would drift out of the telescope's
field of view in only a few minutes.

261
00:19:30,949 --> 00:19:33,884
Humason had to stay awake,
tracking the galaxy...

262
00:19:34,118 --> 00:19:37,053
...while elaborate machinery moved
the telescope...

263
00:19:37,255 --> 00:19:41,191
...slowly in the opposite direction,
to compensate for Earth's rotation.

264
00:19:41,392 --> 00:19:44,327
The telescope is a kind of clock.

265
00:19:46,331 --> 00:19:47,525
HUMASON:
How's the dome?

266
00:19:51,002 --> 00:19:52,435
You're clear.

267
00:19:57,041 --> 00:20:01,637
SAGAN: This work was difficult,
routine, tedious...

268
00:20:01,846 --> 00:20:03,814
...but although they
didn't yet know it...

269
00:20:04,015 --> 00:20:06,984
...Hubble and Humason were
meticulously accumulating...

270
00:20:07,185 --> 00:20:10,086
...the evidence for the big bang.

271
00:20:11,189 --> 00:20:13,851
They had found that
the more distant the galaxy...

272
00:20:14,225 --> 00:20:18,525
...the more its spectrum of colors was
shifted to the red.

273
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,690
HUMASON:
All right, clear the telescope.

274
00:20:24,569 --> 00:20:26,503
I'm coming down now.

275
00:20:27,005 --> 00:20:30,372
If this red shift were due to
the Doppler effect...

276
00:20:30,575 --> 00:20:33,237
...the distant galaxies must be
running away from us.

277
00:20:34,646 --> 00:20:36,204
At the end of his vigil...

278
00:20:36,414 --> 00:20:39,713
...Humason would retrieve
the tiny galactic spectrum...

279
00:20:39,917 --> 00:20:43,114
...and carefully carry it down
to be developed.

280
00:20:49,193 --> 00:20:51,252
Thank you, Mr. Nelson.

281
00:20:52,296 --> 00:20:54,821
I'm going to the darkroom now.

282
00:20:57,168 --> 00:20:59,136
-Good day.
-Good day, sir.

283
00:21:03,975 --> 00:21:05,033
In this way...

284
00:21:05,276 --> 00:21:08,803
...Humason found a red shift
in almost every galaxy he examined...

285
00:21:09,013 --> 00:21:12,414
...like the Doppler shift in
the sound of a receding locomotive.

286
00:21:12,617 --> 00:21:16,747
And the farther away from us they
were, the faster they were receding.

287
00:21:20,692 --> 00:21:24,423
Tied to the fabric of space,
the outward rushing galaxies...

288
00:21:24,662 --> 00:21:28,894
...were tracing the expansion
of the universe itself.

289
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:34,037
An awesome conclusion had been
captured on these tiny glass slides.

290
00:21:35,073 --> 00:21:39,567
Humason and Hubble had discovered
the big bang.

291
00:21:44,382 --> 00:21:46,577
At top and bottom are
calibration lines...

292
00:21:46,784 --> 00:21:48,649
...that Humason had
earlier photographed.

293
00:21:48,853 --> 00:21:52,880
In the middle is the spectrum
of a relatively nearby galaxy.

294
00:21:53,124 --> 00:21:57,060
Every element has a characteristic
spectral fingerprint...

295
00:21:57,261 --> 00:21:59,729
...a set of frequencies
where light is absorbed.

296
00:21:59,964 --> 00:22:03,422
Prominent here are
two dark lines in the violet...

297
00:22:03,634 --> 00:22:05,727
...due to calcium
in the atmospheres...

298
00:22:05,937 --> 00:22:08,167
...of the hundreds of billions
of stars...

299
00:22:08,372 --> 00:22:10,465
...that constitute this galaxy.

300
00:22:10,675 --> 00:22:14,372
Nearby galaxies show very little
Doppler shift.

301
00:22:15,113 --> 00:22:18,549
But when he recorded the spectrum of
a fainter and more distant galaxy...

302
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,480
...he found the same
telltale pair of lines...

303
00:22:21,686 --> 00:22:24,382
...but shifted farther right
toward the red.

304
00:22:24,589 --> 00:22:28,355
And when he examined a remote galaxy
4 billion light-years away...

305
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,153
...he found the lines were
red-shifted even more.

306
00:22:31,362 --> 00:22:36,299
This galaxy must be receding
at 200 million kilometers an hour.

307
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:42,098
The painstaking observations
of Milton Humason...

308
00:22:42,306 --> 00:22:45,173
...astronomer and former
mule-team driver...

309
00:22:45,376 --> 00:22:49,107
...established the expansion
of the universe.

310
00:22:55,419 --> 00:22:59,321
In discussing the large-scale
structure of the cosmos...

311
00:22:59,524 --> 00:23:03,654
...astronomers sometimes say
that space is curved...

312
00:23:03,961 --> 00:23:08,898
...or that the universe is
finite but unbounded.

313
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:11,164
Whatever are they talking about?

314
00:23:12,103 --> 00:23:14,401
Let's imagine that we are
perfectly flat...

315
00:23:14,639 --> 00:23:16,869
...I mean, absolutely flat...

316
00:23:17,074 --> 00:23:21,033
...and that we live,
appropriately enough, in Flatland...

317
00:23:21,245 --> 00:23:26,148
...a land designed and named
by Edwin Abbott...

318
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:29,808
...a Shakespearean scholar
who lived in Victorian England.

319
00:23:30,087 --> 00:23:33,716
Everybody in Flatland is,
of course, exceptionally flat.

320
00:23:34,091 --> 00:23:36,423
We have squares, circles, triangles...

321
00:23:36,661 --> 00:23:38,561
...and we all scurry about...

322
00:23:38,763 --> 00:23:43,496
...and we can go into our houses
and do our flat business.

323
00:23:45,703 --> 00:23:50,436
Now, we have width and length...

324
00:23:50,641 --> 00:23:52,871
...but no height at all.

325
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:56,136
These cutouts have some height,
but let's ignore that.

326
00:23:56,347 --> 00:23:59,282
Let's imagine that these
are absolutely flat.

327
00:23:59,817 --> 00:24:03,719
That being the case, we know,
us Flatlanders...

328
00:24:03,921 --> 00:24:06,788
...about left-right
and about forward-back...

329
00:24:06,991 --> 00:24:09,824
...but we have never heard of up-down.

330
00:24:10,094 --> 00:24:13,791
Let us imagine that into Flatland...

331
00:24:13,998 --> 00:24:15,522
...hovering above it...

332
00:24:15,733 --> 00:24:18,327
...comes a strange
three-dimensional creature...

333
00:24:18,536 --> 00:24:21,903
...which, oddly enough,
looks like an apple.

334
00:24:22,106 --> 00:24:24,267
The three-dimensional creature...

335
00:24:24,475 --> 00:24:27,911
...sees an attractive
congenial-looking square...

336
00:24:28,145 --> 00:24:30,579
...watches it enter its house...

337
00:24:30,781 --> 00:24:35,718
...and decides in a gesture
of inter-dimensional amity...

338
00:24:35,987 --> 00:24:37,318
...to say hello.

339
00:24:37,588 --> 00:24:40,022
"Hello," says
the three-dimensional creature.

340
00:24:40,224 --> 00:24:43,716
"How are you? I am a visitor
from the third dimension."

341
00:24:44,095 --> 00:24:49,032
Well, the poor square looks around
his closed house...

342
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,027
...sees no one there...

343
00:24:51,235 --> 00:24:55,865
...and what's more, has witnessed
a greeting coming from his insides:

344
00:24:56,107 --> 00:24:58,439
A voice from within.

345
00:24:58,643 --> 00:25:02,909
He surely is getting
a little worried about his sanity.

346
00:25:03,648 --> 00:25:05,616
The three-dimensional creature...

347
00:25:05,816 --> 00:25:09,877
...is unhappy about being considered
a psychological aberration...

348
00:25:10,121 --> 00:25:15,024
...and so he descends to
actually enter Flatland.

349
00:25:15,226 --> 00:25:19,287
Now, a three-dimensional creature
exists in Flatland only partially...

350
00:25:19,497 --> 00:25:24,434
...only a plane, a cross section
through him can be seen.

351
00:25:24,735 --> 00:25:27,898
So when the three-dimensional creature
first reaches Flatland...

352
00:25:28,105 --> 00:25:30,630
...only its points of contact
can be seen.

353
00:25:30,841 --> 00:25:35,778
And we'll represent that by stamping
the apple in this ink pad...

354
00:25:36,514 --> 00:25:40,416
...and placing that image in Flatland.

355
00:25:41,018 --> 00:25:45,148
And as the apple were
to descend through...

356
00:25:45,356 --> 00:25:47,756
...slither by Flatland...

357
00:25:47,959 --> 00:25:50,621
...we would progressively see
higher and higher slices...

358
00:25:50,828 --> 00:25:52,455
...which we can represent...

359
00:25:52,663 --> 00:25:57,123
...by cutting the apple.

360
00:25:58,936 --> 00:26:03,339
So the square, as time goes on...

361
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:07,500
...sees a set of objects
mysteriously appear...

362
00:26:07,745 --> 00:26:11,272
...from nowhere,
and inside a closed room...

363
00:26:11,482 --> 00:26:14,508
...and change their shape
dramatically.

364
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:18,286
His only conclusion could be
that he's gone bonkers.

365
00:26:18,489 --> 00:26:22,550
Well, the apple might be a little
annoyed at this conclusion...

366
00:26:22,793 --> 00:26:26,889
...and so not such a friendly gesture
from dimension to dimension...

367
00:26:27,098 --> 00:26:30,158
...makes a contact with
the square from below...

368
00:26:30,368 --> 00:26:32,063
...and sends our flat creature...

369
00:26:32,303 --> 00:26:35,670
...fluttering and spinning
above Flatland.

370
00:26:35,873 --> 00:26:38,307
At first, the square has
no idea what's happening.

371
00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:42,309
He's terribly confused. This is
utterly outside his experience.

372
00:26:42,513 --> 00:26:45,414
But after a while, he comes
to realize...

373
00:26:45,616 --> 00:26:50,451
...that he is seeing inside
closed rooms in Flatland.

374
00:26:50,654 --> 00:26:54,283
He is looking inside
his fellow flat creatures:

375
00:26:54,492 --> 00:26:56,517
He is seeing Flatland
from a perspective...

376
00:26:56,727 --> 00:26:59,287
...no one has ever seen it before,
to his knowledge.

377
00:26:59,497 --> 00:27:02,864
Getting into another dimension
provides, as an incidental benefit...

378
00:27:03,067 --> 00:27:05,467
...a kind of x-ray vision.

379
00:27:05,703 --> 00:27:10,265
Now our flat creature slowly
descends to the surface...

380
00:27:10,474 --> 00:27:14,604
...and his friends rush up
to see him.

381
00:27:14,812 --> 00:27:17,940
From their point of view, he has
mysteriously appeared from nowhere.

382
00:27:18,149 --> 00:27:22,518
He hasn't walked from somewhere else.
He's come from some other place.

383
00:27:22,787 --> 00:27:25,449
They say, "For heaven's sake,
what's happened to you?"

384
00:27:25,656 --> 00:27:27,886
And the poor square has to say:

385
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:31,720
"Well, I was in some other
mystic dimension...

386
00:27:31,929 --> 00:27:33,624
...called 'Up."'

387
00:27:33,831 --> 00:27:37,961
And they will pat him on his side
and comfort him...

388
00:27:38,169 --> 00:27:39,329
...or else they'll ask:

389
00:27:39,537 --> 00:27:43,337
"Well, show us. Where is that
third dimension? Point to it."

390
00:27:43,574 --> 00:27:46,941
And the poor square will be
unable to comply.

391
00:27:47,244 --> 00:27:49,235
But maybe more interesting...

392
00:27:49,447 --> 00:27:52,280
...is the other direction
in dimensionality.

393
00:27:52,483 --> 00:27:55,418
What about the fourth dimension?

394
00:27:56,587 --> 00:27:59,215
Now, to approach that,
let's consider a cube.

395
00:27:59,924 --> 00:28:02,017
We can imagine a cube
in the following way:

396
00:28:02,226 --> 00:28:06,720
Take a line segment and move it at
right angles to itself in equal length.

397
00:28:06,931 --> 00:28:08,455
That makes a square.

398
00:28:08,666 --> 00:28:11,692
Move that square in equal length
at right angles to itself...

399
00:28:11,936 --> 00:28:13,961
...and you have a cube.

400
00:28:14,171 --> 00:28:18,904
Now, this cube, we understand...

401
00:28:19,677 --> 00:28:21,474
...casts a shadow.

402
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:27,110
And that shadow we recognize...

403
00:28:27,318 --> 00:28:31,516
It's, you know, ordinarily drawn
in third-grade classrooms...

404
00:28:31,889 --> 00:28:35,723
...as two squares with
their vertices connected.

405
00:28:35,926 --> 00:28:40,295
If we look at a three-dimensional
object's shadow in two dimensions...

406
00:28:40,498 --> 00:28:43,956
...we see that, in this case,
not all the lines appear equal.

407
00:28:44,168 --> 00:28:45,999
Not all the angles are right angles.

408
00:28:46,237 --> 00:28:48,967
The 3-D object hasn't been
perfectly represented...

409
00:28:49,173 --> 00:28:50,902
...in its projection
in two dimensions.

410
00:28:51,108 --> 00:28:55,909
But that's part of the cost of losing
a dimension in the projection.

411
00:28:58,115 --> 00:29:01,414
Now, let's take this
three-dimensional cube...

412
00:29:01,619 --> 00:29:06,318
...and project it, carry it through
a fourth physical dimension:

413
00:29:06,524 --> 00:29:10,255
Not that way, not that way,
not that way.

414
00:29:10,461 --> 00:29:12,986
But at right angles to
those three directions.

415
00:29:13,197 --> 00:29:14,824
I can't show you that direction.

416
00:29:15,032 --> 00:29:17,933
But imagine that there is
a fourth physical dimension.

417
00:29:18,135 --> 00:29:22,595
In that case, we would generate
a four-dimensional hyper-cube...

418
00:29:22,806 --> 00:29:24,831
...which is also called a tesseract.

419
00:29:25,042 --> 00:29:28,205
I cannot show you a tesseract
because I and you...

420
00:29:28,412 --> 00:29:30,380
...are trapped in three dimensions.

421
00:29:30,614 --> 00:29:35,210
But what I can show you is
the shadow in three dimensions...

422
00:29:35,452 --> 00:29:38,546
...of a four-dimensional hyper-cube
or tesseract.

423
00:29:38,756 --> 00:29:43,386
This is it, and you can see
its two nested cubes...

424
00:29:43,627 --> 00:29:46,687
...all the vertices connected
by lines.

425
00:29:46,897 --> 00:29:50,958
And now the real tesseract
in four dimensions...

426
00:29:51,168 --> 00:29:54,934
...would have all lines of equal
length and all angles right angles.

427
00:29:55,272 --> 00:30:00,039
That's not what we see here,
but that's the penalty of projection.

428
00:30:00,644 --> 00:30:05,581
So you see, while we cannot imagine
the world of four dimensions...

429
00:30:06,183 --> 00:30:10,415
...we can certainly think about it
perfectly well.

430
00:30:11,455 --> 00:30:14,754
Now, imagine a universe
just like Flatland...

431
00:30:14,959 --> 00:30:19,259
...truly two-dimensional and entirely
flat in every direction.

432
00:30:19,496 --> 00:30:21,361
But with one exception:

433
00:30:22,099 --> 00:30:24,363
Unbeknownst to the inhabitants...

434
00:30:24,568 --> 00:30:26,866
...their two-dimensional universe
is curved...

435
00:30:27,071 --> 00:30:29,437
...into a third physical dimension.

436
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,006
Maybe into a sphere,
but at any rate...

437
00:30:32,209 --> 00:30:35,110
...into something entirely outside
their experience.

438
00:30:36,981 --> 00:30:39,950
Locally, their universe still looks
flat enough.

439
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:44,211
But if one of them,
much smaller and flatter than me...

440
00:30:44,455 --> 00:30:48,448
...takes a very long walk along what
seems to be a straight line...

441
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:51,219
...he would uncover a great mystery.

442
00:30:51,428 --> 00:30:54,864
Suppose he marked
his starting point here...

443
00:30:55,065 --> 00:30:59,024
...and set off to explore
his universe.

444
00:31:00,137 --> 00:31:03,038
He never turns around
and he never reaches an edge.

445
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,732
He doesn't know that
his apparently flat universe...

446
00:31:06,944 --> 00:31:10,243
...is actually curved
into an enormous sphere.

447
00:31:10,481 --> 00:31:14,144
He doesn't sense that he's
walking around a globe.

448
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,147
Why should his space be curved?

449
00:31:18,355 --> 00:31:20,448
Because this universe has
so much matter...

450
00:31:20,658 --> 00:31:22,592
...that it gravitationally
warps space...

451
00:31:22,826 --> 00:31:25,624
...closing it back on itself
into a sphere.

452
00:31:25,996 --> 00:31:28,260
But our Flatlander doesn't
know this.

453
00:31:28,499 --> 00:31:33,436
After a long while, he'll find he
somehow returns to his starting point.

454
00:31:33,704 --> 00:31:36,673
There must be a third dimension.

455
00:31:36,874 --> 00:31:40,708
Our Flatlander couldn't imagine
a third dimension...

456
00:31:40,944 --> 00:31:43,037
...but he could sure deduce it.

457
00:31:43,247 --> 00:31:45,875
Increase all the dimensions
in this story by one...

458
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:48,745
...and you have something
like the situation...

459
00:31:48,952 --> 00:31:52,718
...which many cosmologists think
may actually apply to us.

460
00:31:52,956 --> 00:31:57,359
We are three-dimensional creatures
trapped in three dimensions.

461
00:31:57,561 --> 00:32:01,224
We imagine our universe to be flat
in three dimensions...

462
00:32:01,432 --> 00:32:05,630
...but maybe it's curved
into a fourth.

463
00:32:05,869 --> 00:32:09,635
We can talk about a fourth physical
dimension, but we can't experience it.

464
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,274
No one can point to
the fourth dimension.

465
00:32:12,509 --> 00:32:16,570
There's left-right and there's
forward-back. There's up-down...

466
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:19,749
...and there's some
other directions...

467
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:24,819
...simultaneously at right angles
to those familiar three dimensions.

468
00:32:25,723 --> 00:32:28,749
Now, imagine this universe
is expanding.

469
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,821
If we blow it up like a four-
dimensional balloon, what happens?

470
00:32:34,031 --> 00:32:35,999
An astronomer on a given galaxy...

471
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,692
...thinks all the other galaxies are
running away from him.

472
00:32:41,004 --> 00:32:44,337
The more distant the galaxy,
the faster it seems to be moving.

473
00:32:44,541 --> 00:32:47,738
This is just what
Humason and Hubble found.

474
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:54,112
On the surface of this curved universe,
there is no boundary or center.

475
00:32:54,318 --> 00:32:59,119
The universe can be
both finite and unbounded.

476
00:33:02,893 --> 00:33:05,123
The red shift of
the distant galaxies...

477
00:33:05,329 --> 00:33:07,559
...seemed to imply to
Humason's contemporaries...

478
00:33:07,798 --> 00:33:10,562
...that we were at the center
of an expanding universe...

479
00:33:10,768 --> 00:33:13,532
...that our place in space was
somehow privileged.

480
00:33:13,737 --> 00:33:15,204
But if the universe is expanding...

481
00:33:15,406 --> 00:33:18,068
...whether or not it's curved
into a fourth dimension...

482
00:33:18,308 --> 00:33:22,142
...observers on every galaxy will see
precisely the same thing:

483
00:33:22,346 --> 00:33:24,814
All the galaxies rushing
away from them...

484
00:33:25,015 --> 00:33:29,918
...as if they had made some dreadful
intergalactic social blunder.

485
00:33:30,154 --> 00:33:33,646
If there's enough matter to close
the universe gravitationally...

486
00:33:33,857 --> 00:33:37,088
...then it's wrapped in on itself
like a sphere.

487
00:33:38,829 --> 00:33:42,424
If there isn't enough matter
to close the cosmos...

488
00:33:42,633 --> 00:33:45,033
...then our universe has
an open shape...

489
00:33:45,269 --> 00:33:48,670
...extending forever
in all directions.

490
00:33:49,173 --> 00:33:53,507
This saddle universe is only one
of an infinite number...

491
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:56,838
...of possible kinds of
open universes.

492
00:33:57,047 --> 00:33:59,948
Unlike such closed universes
as the sphere...

493
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:04,814
...open universes have in them
an infinite amount of space.

494
00:34:07,024 --> 00:34:09,492
If our universe is,
in fact, closed off...

495
00:34:09,693 --> 00:34:13,185
...then nothing can get out,
not matter, not light.

496
00:34:13,397 --> 00:34:16,332
We would then be living inside
a black hole.

497
00:34:16,567 --> 00:34:18,831
There is one possible
way out, though:

498
00:34:19,036 --> 00:34:23,871
A hypothetical tunnel or wormhole
through the next higher dimension...

499
00:34:24,074 --> 00:34:27,407
...a place sucking in
matter and light.

500
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:32,679
Can we find such a wormhole?
Could we survive the trip?

501
00:34:35,319 --> 00:34:38,049
We might emerge in some other
place and time...

502
00:34:38,255 --> 00:34:39,882
...perhaps in another universe...

503
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:43,184
...or perhaps somewhere else
in our own.

504
00:34:45,596 --> 00:34:49,464
If you want to know what it's like
inside a black hole...

505
00:34:49,666 --> 00:34:51,327
...look around.

506
00:34:52,102 --> 00:34:57,039
But we don't yet know whether
the universe is open or closed.

507
00:34:57,241 --> 00:34:59,766
More than that,
some astronomers doubt...

508
00:34:59,977 --> 00:35:02,343
...that the red shift
of distant galaxies...

509
00:35:02,546 --> 00:35:04,104
...is due to the Doppler effect.

510
00:35:04,448 --> 00:35:08,885
They are skeptical about the expanding
universe and the big bang.

511
00:35:09,086 --> 00:35:13,182
Perhaps our descendants will regard
our present ignorance...

512
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:17,053
...with as much sympathy as we feel
to the ancients...

513
00:35:17,261 --> 00:35:19,957
...for not knowing whether the Earth
went around the sun.

514
00:35:20,664 --> 00:35:23,497
If the general picture, however,
of a big bang...

515
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:27,101
...followed by an expanding universe
is correct...

516
00:35:27,304 --> 00:35:28,862
...what happened before that?

517
00:35:29,072 --> 00:35:32,508
Was the universe devoid
of all matter...

518
00:35:32,709 --> 00:35:35,234
...and then the matter suddenly
somehow created?

519
00:35:35,445 --> 00:35:37,242
How did that happen?

520
00:35:37,748 --> 00:35:40,581
In many cultures,
the customary answer...

521
00:35:40,784 --> 00:35:45,619
...is that a god or gods created
the universe out of nothing.

522
00:35:46,323 --> 00:35:49,724
But if we wish to pursue
this question courageously...

523
00:35:49,927 --> 00:35:52,828
...we must, of course,
ask the next question:

524
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:55,021
Where did God come from?

525
00:35:55,232 --> 00:35:57,996
If we decide that this is
an unanswerable question...

526
00:35:58,201 --> 00:36:00,635
...why not save a step and conclude...

527
00:36:00,837 --> 00:36:04,637
...that the origin of the universe is
an unanswerable question?

528
00:36:04,841 --> 00:36:08,470
Or if we say that God
always existed...

529
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:10,874
...why not save a step and conclude...

530
00:36:11,081 --> 00:36:12,912
...that the universe always existed?

531
00:36:13,116 --> 00:36:15,710
There's no need for a creation.
It was always here.

532
00:36:15,919 --> 00:36:17,716
These are not easy questions.

533
00:36:17,921 --> 00:36:20,481
Cosmology brings us face to face...

534
00:36:20,691 --> 00:36:22,522
...with the deepest mysteries...

535
00:36:22,726 --> 00:36:27,493
...with questions that were once
treated only in religion and myth.

536
00:36:39,109 --> 00:36:40,872
"Who knows for certain?

537
00:36:41,078 --> 00:36:43,171
Who shall here declare it?

538
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:46,679
Whence was it born?
Whence came creation?

539
00:36:47,284 --> 00:36:50,981
The gods are later than
this world's formation.

540
00:36:51,555 --> 00:36:55,548
Who then can know
the origins of the world?

541
00:36:57,561 --> 00:37:00,155
None knows whence creation arose...

542
00:37:00,364 --> 00:37:02,696
...or whether He has
or has not made it...

543
00:37:02,899 --> 00:37:06,699
...He who surveys it
from the lofty skies.

544
00:37:06,903 --> 00:37:08,564
Only He knows...

545
00:37:09,106 --> 00:37:12,166
...or perhaps He knows not."

546
00:37:16,179 --> 00:37:19,580
These words are 3500 years old.

547
00:37:19,783 --> 00:37:21,614
They're taken from the Rig-Veda...

548
00:37:21,818 --> 00:37:24,514
...a collection of early
Sanskrit hymns.

549
00:37:24,721 --> 00:37:28,623
The most sophisticated ancient
cosmological ideas came from Asia...

550
00:37:28,825 --> 00:37:31,089
...and particularly from India.

551
00:37:31,294 --> 00:37:35,253
Here, there's a tradition
of skeptical questioning...

552
00:37:35,465 --> 00:37:40,129
...and unselfconscious humility
before the great cosmic mysteries.

553
00:37:41,071 --> 00:37:43,596
Amidst the routine of daily life...

554
00:37:43,807 --> 00:37:46,571
...in, say, the harvesting
and winnowing of grain...

555
00:37:46,777 --> 00:37:49,177
...people all over the world
have wondered:

556
00:37:49,379 --> 00:37:53,042
Where did the universe come from?

557
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:57,277
Asking this question is
a hallmark of our species.

558
00:38:04,027 --> 00:38:05,892
There's a natural tendency
to understand...

559
00:38:06,096 --> 00:38:10,123
...the origin of the cosmos
in familiar biological terms.

560
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:12,426
The mating of cosmic deities...

561
00:38:12,636 --> 00:38:14,194
...or the hatching of a cosmic egg...

562
00:38:14,404 --> 00:38:17,862
...or maybe the intonation
of some magic phrase.

563
00:38:26,249 --> 00:38:30,185
The big bang is our modern
scientific creation myth.

564
00:38:30,387 --> 00:38:32,548
It comes from the same human need...

565
00:38:32,756 --> 00:38:34,656
...to solve the cosmological riddle.

566
00:38:36,893 --> 00:38:38,554
Most cultures imagined the world...

567
00:38:38,762 --> 00:38:41,253
...to be only a few hundred
generations old.

568
00:38:41,465 --> 00:38:45,367
Hardly anyone guessed that
the cosmos might be far older.

569
00:38:45,569 --> 00:38:47,867
But the ancient Hindus did.

570
00:38:53,076 --> 00:38:55,670
They, like every other society...

571
00:38:55,879 --> 00:38:59,474
...noted and calibrated
the cycles in nature.

572
00:39:00,751 --> 00:39:04,243
The rising and setting
of the sun and the stars...

573
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:08,849
...the phases of the moon...

574
00:39:12,129 --> 00:39:14,461
...the passing of the seasons.

575
00:39:25,075 --> 00:39:28,306
All over South India,
an age-old ceremony...

576
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:30,480
...takes place every January...

577
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,807
...a rejoicing in the
generosity of nature...

578
00:39:33,016 --> 00:39:35,484
...in the annual harvesting
of the crops.

579
00:39:35,685 --> 00:39:39,815
Every January, nature provides
the rice to celebrate Pongal.

580
00:39:42,125 --> 00:39:46,562
Even the draft animals are given the
day off and garlanded with flowers.

581
00:39:47,764 --> 00:39:51,495
(SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

582
00:39:58,408 --> 00:40:02,139
Colorful designs are painted
on the ground to attract harmony...

583
00:40:02,345 --> 00:40:05,041
...and good fortune
for the coming year.

584
00:40:32,075 --> 00:40:37,012
Pongal, a simple porridge,
a mixture of rice and sweet milk...

585
00:40:37,214 --> 00:40:40,377
...symbolizes the harvest,
the return of the seasons.

586
00:40:45,055 --> 00:40:49,082
(SHOUTING)

587
00:40:53,063 --> 00:40:56,555
However, this is not merely
a harvest festival.

588
00:40:56,766 --> 00:41:01,931
It has ties to an elegant and
much deeper cosmological tradition.

589
00:41:13,783 --> 00:41:16,843
The Pongal festival is
a rejoicing in the fact...

590
00:41:17,053 --> 00:41:19,283
...that there are cycles in nature.

591
00:41:19,923 --> 00:41:23,051
But how could such cycles come about
unless the gods will them?

592
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:26,823
And if there are cycles
in the years of humans...

593
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:31,433
...might there not be cycles
in the eons of the gods?

594
00:41:32,068 --> 00:41:34,593
Hinduism is the only one
of the world's great faiths...

595
00:41:34,804 --> 00:41:39,104
...dedicated to the idea
that the cosmos itself...

596
00:41:39,309 --> 00:41:42,608
...undergoes an immense,
indeed, an infinite...

597
00:41:42,812 --> 00:41:45,747
...number of deaths and rebirths.

598
00:42:01,731 --> 00:42:05,132
It is the only religion in which
the time scales correspond...

599
00:42:05,335 --> 00:42:09,066
...no doubt by accident, to those
of modern scientific cosmology.

600
00:42:09,272 --> 00:42:12,469
Its cycles run from our
ordinary day and night...

601
00:42:12,676 --> 00:42:15,304
...to a day and night of Brahma...

602
00:42:15,512 --> 00:42:18,879
...8.64 billion years long...

603
00:42:19,182 --> 00:42:22,481
...longer than the age
of the Earth or the sun...

604
00:42:22,686 --> 00:42:25,553
...and about half the time
since the big bang.

605
00:42:25,755 --> 00:42:29,657
And there are much longer
time scales still.

606
00:42:38,301 --> 00:42:40,929
There is the deep
and appealing notion...

607
00:42:41,137 --> 00:42:45,574
...that the universe is
but the dream of the god...

608
00:42:46,176 --> 00:42:50,306
...who after 100 Brahma years...

609
00:42:50,513 --> 00:42:54,108
...dissolves himself into
a dreamless sleep...

610
00:42:54,484 --> 00:42:57,282
...and the universe
dissolves with him.

611
00:42:57,854 --> 00:43:02,553
Until, after another
Brahma century, he stirs...

612
00:43:02,759 --> 00:43:06,195
...recomposes himself
and begins again...

613
00:43:06,396 --> 00:43:09,991
...to dream the great
cosmic lotus dream.

614
00:43:14,571 --> 00:43:17,802
Meanwhile, elsewhere...

615
00:43:18,008 --> 00:43:21,375
...there are an infinite number
of other universes...

616
00:43:21,578 --> 00:43:24,376
...each with its own god...

617
00:43:24,581 --> 00:43:27,550
...dreaming the cosmic dream.

618
00:43:29,753 --> 00:43:34,122
These great ideas are
tempered by another...

619
00:43:34,324 --> 00:43:36,224
...perhaps still greater.

620
00:43:36,693 --> 00:43:38,217
It is said...

621
00:43:38,528 --> 00:43:42,259
...that men may not be
the dreams of the gods...

622
00:43:42,465 --> 00:43:45,161
...but rather that the gods...

623
00:43:45,368 --> 00:43:48,132
...are the dreams of men.

624
00:43:53,109 --> 00:43:55,100
In India, there are many gods...

625
00:43:55,311 --> 00:43:58,747
...and each god has many
manifestations.

626
00:43:58,948 --> 00:44:02,247
These Chola bronzes cast
in the 11th century...

627
00:44:02,452 --> 00:44:06,718
...include several different
incarnations of the god Shiva...

628
00:44:06,923 --> 00:44:09,414
...seen here at his wedding.

629
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:13,629
The most elegant and sublime
of these bronzes...

630
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:17,266
...is a representation of
the creation of the universe...

631
00:44:17,467 --> 00:44:19,867
...at the beginning
of each cosmic cycle:

632
00:44:20,437 --> 00:44:24,271
A motif known as
the cosmic dance of Shiva.

633
00:44:24,974 --> 00:44:27,272
The god has four hands.

634
00:44:27,477 --> 00:44:30,537
In the upper right hand is a drum...

635
00:44:30,747 --> 00:44:34,979
...whose sound is
the sound of creation.

636
00:44:35,218 --> 00:44:38,381
In the upper left hand
is a tongue of flame...

637
00:44:38,588 --> 00:44:43,116
...a reminder that the universe,
now newly created...

638
00:44:43,326 --> 00:44:48,229
...will, billions of years from now,
be utterly destroyed.

639
00:44:48,431 --> 00:44:51,366
Creation, destruction.

640
00:45:15,725 --> 00:45:19,217
These profound and lovely ideas...

641
00:45:19,429 --> 00:45:22,523
...are central to ancient
Hindu beliefs...

642
00:45:22,732 --> 00:45:27,669
...as exemplified in this
Chola temple at Darasuram.

643
00:45:28,671 --> 00:45:33,165
They're a kind of premonition
of modern astronomical ideas.

644
00:45:33,676 --> 00:45:37,407
Without doubt, the universe has been
expanding since the big bang...

645
00:45:37,614 --> 00:45:42,176
...but it is, by no means, clear that
it will continue to expand forever.

646
00:45:42,385 --> 00:45:46,617
If there is less than a certain
amount of matter in the universe...

647
00:45:46,823 --> 00:45:50,452
...then the mutual gravitation
of the receding galaxies...

648
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:53,891
...will be insufficient
to stop the expansion...

649
00:45:54,097 --> 00:45:57,066
...and the universe will
run away forever.

650
00:45:57,433 --> 00:46:00,459
But if there is more matter
than we can see...

651
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:03,662
...hidden away in black holes, say...

652
00:46:03,873 --> 00:46:07,274
...or in hot but invisible gas
between the galaxies...

653
00:46:07,477 --> 00:46:09,945
...then the universe holds together...

654
00:46:10,146 --> 00:46:13,309
...and partakes of a very Indian
succession of cycles...

655
00:46:13,516 --> 00:46:16,314
...expansion followed
by contraction...

656
00:46:16,519 --> 00:46:21,081
...cosmos upon cosmos,
universes without end.

657
00:46:21,324 --> 00:46:23,884
If we live in such
an oscillating universe...

658
00:46:24,093 --> 00:46:26,755
...the big bang is not
the creation of the cosmos...

659
00:46:26,963 --> 00:46:29,523
...but merely the end
of the previous cycle...

660
00:46:29,732 --> 00:46:34,601
...the destruction of the last
incarnation of the cosmos.

661
00:46:35,705 --> 00:46:38,265
Neither of these modern cosmologies...

662
00:46:38,474 --> 00:46:40,965
...may be altogether to our liking.

663
00:46:41,244 --> 00:46:46,079
In one cosmology, the universe
is created somehow...

664
00:46:46,282 --> 00:46:49,581
...from nothing
15 to 20 billion years ago...

665
00:46:49,886 --> 00:46:51,615
...and expands forever...

666
00:46:51,821 --> 00:46:55,518
...the galaxies mutually receding
until the last one...

667
00:46:55,725 --> 00:46:59,525
...disappears over our cosmic horizon.

668
00:46:59,862 --> 00:47:04,231
Then the galactic astronomers
are out of business...

669
00:47:04,434 --> 00:47:09,371
...the stars cool and die,
matter itself decays...

670
00:47:09,639 --> 00:47:11,470
...and the universe becomes...

671
00:47:11,674 --> 00:47:16,134
...a thin, cold haze
of elementary particles.

672
00:47:16,346 --> 00:47:19,747
In the other,
the oscillating universe...

673
00:47:19,949 --> 00:47:22,679
...the cosmos has no beginning
and no end...

674
00:47:22,885 --> 00:47:25,251
...and we are in the midst
of an infinite cycle...

675
00:47:25,455 --> 00:47:29,391
...of cosmic deaths and rebirths
with no information...

676
00:47:29,592 --> 00:47:33,392
...trickling through the cusps
of the oscillation.

677
00:47:33,596 --> 00:47:37,657
Nothing of the galaxies,
stars, planets...

678
00:47:37,867 --> 00:47:39,801
...life forms, civilizations...

679
00:47:40,003 --> 00:47:43,370
...evolved in the previous
incarnation of the universe...

680
00:47:43,573 --> 00:47:45,803
...trickles through the cusp...

681
00:47:46,009 --> 00:47:47,840
...flitters past the big bang...

682
00:47:48,044 --> 00:47:50,808
...to be known in our universe.

683
00:47:55,952 --> 00:47:59,251
The death of the universe
in either cosmology...

684
00:47:59,455 --> 00:48:01,855
...may seem a little depressing.

685
00:48:02,058 --> 00:48:06,324
But we may take some solace
in the time scales involved.

686
00:48:06,529 --> 00:48:11,466
These events will take tens
of billions of years or more.

687
00:48:11,734 --> 00:48:16,103
Human beings, or our descendants,
whoever they might be...

688
00:48:16,306 --> 00:48:20,174
...can do a great deal of good
in tens of billions of years...

689
00:48:20,376 --> 00:48:23,345
...before the cosmos dies.

690
00:48:41,097 --> 00:48:43,122
If the universe truly oscillates...

691
00:48:43,333 --> 00:48:47,497
...if the modern scientific version
of the old Hindu cosmology is valid...

692
00:48:47,704 --> 00:48:50,229
...then still stranger
questions arise.

693
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:53,102
Some scientists think
that when a red shift...

694
00:48:53,309 --> 00:48:55,470
...is followed by blue shift...

695
00:48:55,678 --> 00:48:58,613
...causality will be inverted...

696
00:48:58,815 --> 00:49:02,046
...and effects will precede causes.

697
00:49:02,385 --> 00:49:04,444
First, the ripples spread out...

698
00:49:04,654 --> 00:49:06,713
...from a point
on the water's surface.

699
00:49:06,923 --> 00:49:10,359
Then I throw the stone into the pond.

700
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:18,496
Some scientists wonder,
in an oscillating universe...

701
00:49:18,701 --> 00:49:21,795
...about what happens at the cusps...

702
00:49:22,004 --> 00:49:26,634
...at the transition from
contraction to expansion.

703
00:49:26,843 --> 00:49:30,643
Some think that the laws of nature
are then randomly reshuffled...

704
00:49:30,847 --> 00:49:34,214
...that the physics and chemistry
we have in this universe...

705
00:49:34,417 --> 00:49:37,477
...represent only one
of an infinite range...

706
00:49:37,687 --> 00:49:40,713
...of possible natural laws.

707
00:49:42,225 --> 00:49:43,852
It is easy to see...

708
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:46,585
...that only a restricted range
of laws of nature...

709
00:49:46,796 --> 00:49:50,698
...are consistent with galaxies
and stars, planets...

710
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:53,130
...life and intelligence.

711
00:49:53,336 --> 00:49:55,099
If the laws of nature are...

712
00:49:55,304 --> 00:49:58,467
...randomly reshuffled at the cusps...

713
00:49:58,975 --> 00:50:01,443
...then it is only the most
extraordinary coincidence...

714
00:50:01,644 --> 00:50:05,307
...that the cosmic slot machine
has this time come up...

715
00:50:05,515 --> 00:50:08,882
...with a universe
consistent with us.

716
00:50:09,452 --> 00:50:13,582
Do we live in a universe
which expands forever...

717
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:18,727
...or in one where there is
a nested set of infinite cycles?

718
00:50:19,495 --> 00:50:21,793
There's a way to find out
the answer...

719
00:50:21,998 --> 00:50:24,626
...not by mysticism,
but through science...

720
00:50:24,834 --> 00:50:26,495
...by making an accurate census...

721
00:50:26,702 --> 00:50:30,194
...of the total amount of matter
in the universe...

722
00:50:33,075 --> 00:50:37,444
...or by seeing to the very edge
of the cosmos.

723
00:50:47,957 --> 00:50:51,984
Radio telescopes are able to
detect distant quasars...

724
00:50:52,195 --> 00:50:54,060
...billions of light-years away...

725
00:50:54,263 --> 00:50:57,699
...expanding with
the fabric of space.

726
00:51:00,636 --> 00:51:02,763
By looking far out into space...

727
00:51:02,972 --> 00:51:05,839
...we are also looking
far back into time...

728
00:51:06,042 --> 00:51:08,670
...back toward the horizon
of the universe...

729
00:51:08,878 --> 00:51:12,109
...back toward the epoch
of the big bang.

730
00:51:13,549 --> 00:51:15,744
Radio telescopes have
even detected...

731
00:51:15,952 --> 00:51:18,512
...the cosmic background radiation.

732
00:51:18,721 --> 00:51:22,885
The fires of the big bang
cooled and red-shifted...

733
00:51:23,092 --> 00:51:26,653
...faintly echoing down
the corridors of time.

734
00:51:35,671 --> 00:51:38,003
This is the very large array...

735
00:51:38,207 --> 00:51:41,870
...a collection of 17 separate
radio telescopes...

736
00:51:42,078 --> 00:51:43,841
...all working collectively...

737
00:51:44,046 --> 00:51:46,776
...in a remote region of New Mexico.

738
00:51:46,983 --> 00:51:51,010
Modern radio telescopes are
exquisitely sensitive.

739
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:54,678
A distant quasar is so faint...

740
00:51:54,891 --> 00:51:58,793
...that its received radiation
by some such telescope...

741
00:51:58,995 --> 00:52:03,762
...amounts to maybe
a quadrillionth of a watt.

742
00:52:04,133 --> 00:52:08,297
In fact, and this is a reasonably
stunning piece of information...

743
00:52:08,504 --> 00:52:10,972
...the total amount of energy
ever received...

744
00:52:11,173 --> 00:52:13,767
...by all the radio telescopes
on the planet Earth...

745
00:52:13,976 --> 00:52:18,470
...is less than the energy
of a single snowflake...

746
00:52:18,681 --> 00:52:20,546
...striking the ground.

747
00:52:20,917 --> 00:52:24,045
In detecting the cosmic
background radiation...

748
00:52:24,253 --> 00:52:26,517
...in counting quasars...

749
00:52:26,722 --> 00:52:29,748
...in searching for intelligent
signals from space...

750
00:52:29,959 --> 00:52:33,622
...radio astronomers are dealing
with amounts of energy...

751
00:52:33,829 --> 00:52:35,490
...which are barely there at all.

752
00:52:42,004 --> 00:52:46,373
These radio telescopes,
rising like giant flowers...

753
00:52:46,576 --> 00:52:48,100
...from the New Mexico desert...

754
00:52:48,311 --> 00:52:51,303
...are monuments to human ingenuity.

755
00:52:54,483 --> 00:52:57,509
The faint radio waves
are collected, focused...

756
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:01,349
...assembled and amplified,
and then converted...

757
00:53:01,557 --> 00:53:06,324
...into pictures of nebulae,
galaxies and quasars.

758
00:53:08,898 --> 00:53:11,366
If you had eyes that
worked in radio light...

759
00:53:11,567 --> 00:53:14,058
...they'd probably be bigger
than wagon wheels...

760
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:16,761
...and this is the universe you'd see.

761
00:53:18,874 --> 00:53:21,138
An elliptical galaxy, for example...

762
00:53:21,344 --> 00:53:25,440
...leaving behind it a long wake
glowing in radio waves.

763
00:53:29,485 --> 00:53:32,511
Radio waves reveal
a universe of quasars...

764
00:53:32,722 --> 00:53:36,385
...interacting galaxies,
titanic explosions.

765
00:53:42,365 --> 00:53:45,528
Every time we use another kind
of light to view the cosmos...

766
00:53:45,735 --> 00:53:48,727
...we open a new door of perception.

767
00:53:51,641 --> 00:53:55,168
As the murmurs from the edge
of the cosmos slowly accumulate...

768
00:53:55,378 --> 00:53:58,245
...our understanding grows.

769
00:54:03,986 --> 00:54:08,013
This is an exploration of
the ancient and the invisible...

770
00:54:08,224 --> 00:54:10,454
...a continuing human inquiry...

771
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:14,221
...into the grand cosmological
questions.

772
00:54:25,708 --> 00:54:28,176
Another important recent finding...

773
00:54:28,377 --> 00:54:32,006
...was made by x-ray observatories
in Earth orbit.

774
00:54:32,214 --> 00:54:36,275
Artificial satellites launched
to view the sky...

775
00:54:36,485 --> 00:54:40,285
...not in ordinary visible light,
not in radio waves...

776
00:54:40,489 --> 00:54:42,457
...but in x-ray light.

777
00:54:42,658 --> 00:54:45,821
There seems to be an immense cloud...

778
00:54:46,028 --> 00:54:48,292
...of extremely hot hydrogen...

779
00:54:48,497 --> 00:54:52,695
...glowing in x-rays between
some galaxies.

780
00:54:52,902 --> 00:54:55,370
Now, if this amount of
intergalactic matter...

781
00:54:55,571 --> 00:54:58,699
...were typical of all
clusters of galaxies...

782
00:54:58,908 --> 00:55:03,641
...then there may be just enough
matter to close the cosmos...

783
00:55:03,846 --> 00:55:08,408
...and to trap us forever
in an oscillating universe.

784
00:55:12,888 --> 00:55:15,448
If the cosmos is closed...

785
00:55:15,658 --> 00:55:19,560
...there's a strange, haunting,
evocative possibility...

786
00:55:19,762 --> 00:55:23,823
...one of the most exquisite
conjectures in science or religion.

787
00:55:24,033 --> 00:55:26,433
It's entirely undemonstrated...

788
00:55:26,635 --> 00:55:30,298
...it may never be proved,
but it's stirring.

789
00:55:30,506 --> 00:55:35,068
Our entire universe, to the
farthest galaxy, we are told...

790
00:55:35,277 --> 00:55:37,609
...is no more than
a closed electron...

791
00:55:37,813 --> 00:55:41,214
...in a far grander universe
we can never see.

792
00:55:41,417 --> 00:55:43,749
That universe is only
an elementary particle...

793
00:55:43,953 --> 00:55:48,447
...in another still greater
universe and so on forever.

794
00:55:48,824 --> 00:55:52,453
Also, every electron
in our universe, it is claimed...

795
00:55:52,661 --> 00:55:55,061
...is an entire miniature cosmos...

796
00:55:55,264 --> 00:55:59,963
...containing galaxies and stars
and life and electrons.

797
00:56:00,169 --> 00:56:03,798
Every one of those electrons
contains a still smaller universe...

798
00:56:04,006 --> 00:56:07,965
...an infinite regression
up and down.

799
00:56:11,747 --> 00:56:14,147
Every human generation has asked...

800
00:56:14,350 --> 00:56:17,251
...about the origin
and fate of the cosmos.

801
00:56:17,453 --> 00:56:21,150
Ours is the first generation
with a real chance...

802
00:56:21,357 --> 00:56:24,190
...of finding some of the answers.

803
00:56:24,794 --> 00:56:26,159
One way or another...

804
00:56:26,362 --> 00:56:30,696
...we are poised at
the edge of forever.

805
00:56:40,009 --> 00:56:44,503
Except for planetary exploration,
the study of galaxies and cosmology...

806
00:56:44,713 --> 00:56:48,080
...what this episode was about, have
undergone the greatest advances...

807
00:56:48,284 --> 00:56:50,479
...since Cosmos was first broadcast.

808
00:56:50,686 --> 00:56:53,519
For one thing, at last we have
a good photograph...

809
00:56:53,722 --> 00:56:55,553
...of our own Milky Way galaxy...

810
00:56:55,758 --> 00:56:58,818
...about 100,000 light-years across.

811
00:56:59,161 --> 00:57:00,423
Here it is.

812
00:57:05,434 --> 00:57:08,631
It was taken by
NASA's Coby satellite.

813
00:57:08,838 --> 00:57:11,807
We see it edge on, of course,
since we're embedded...

814
00:57:12,007 --> 00:57:13,941
...in the plane of the galaxy.

815
00:57:14,243 --> 00:57:16,234
But you don't need
a spacecraft to see it.

816
00:57:16,445 --> 00:57:19,471
If it's a clear night,
why not go out and take a look...

817
00:57:19,682 --> 00:57:21,309
...at the Milky Way?

818
00:57:22,017 --> 00:57:24,178
There's also new evidence
suggesting...

819
00:57:24,386 --> 00:57:28,117
...that the Milky Way is not so much
an ordinary spiral galaxy...

820
00:57:28,324 --> 00:57:31,225
...as a barred spiral, like this.

821
00:57:35,598 --> 00:57:38,465
Important work has now been done
on mapping...

822
00:57:38,667 --> 00:57:43,195
...how the galaxies are scattered
through intergalactic space.

823
00:57:43,539 --> 00:57:46,406
To the surprise of
a lot of scientists...

824
00:57:46,609 --> 00:57:49,772
...on a scale of hundreds
of millions of light-years...

825
00:57:49,979 --> 00:57:54,382
...the galaxies turn out
not to be strewn at random...

826
00:57:54,583 --> 00:57:57,552
...or concentrated in clusters
of galaxies...

827
00:57:57,753 --> 00:57:59,880
...but instead, strung out...

828
00:58:00,089 --> 00:58:04,492
...along odd, irregular surfaces,
like this.

829
00:58:05,728 --> 00:58:08,492
Every dot in this computer animation...

830
00:58:08,697 --> 00:58:10,187
...is a galaxy.

831
00:58:10,532 --> 00:58:13,968
The computer lets us look at this
distribution of galaxies...

832
00:58:14,169 --> 00:58:15,636
...from many points of view...

833
00:58:15,838 --> 00:58:18,830
...but this is how it looks
from the Earth.

834
00:58:19,141 --> 00:58:23,475
There is an odd mannequin shape...

835
00:58:23,679 --> 00:58:27,547
...that is presented by
the distribution of galaxies.

836
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:29,877
This work has been done...

837
00:58:30,085 --> 00:58:32,417
...mainly by Margaret Geller...

838
00:58:32,621 --> 00:58:34,714
...with her collaborator
John Huchra...

839
00:58:34,924 --> 00:58:38,121
...at Harvard University
and the Smithsonian Institution.

840
00:58:47,603 --> 00:58:51,004
It's a little like soap bubbles
in a bathtub...

841
00:58:51,206 --> 00:58:52,867
...or dishwashing detergent.

842
00:58:53,075 --> 00:58:56,943
The galaxies are on the surfaces
of the bubbles.

843
00:58:57,146 --> 00:59:01,082
The insides of the bubbles seem
to have no galaxies in them at all.

844
00:59:01,283 --> 00:59:05,413
An average bubble is about
100 million light-years across.

845
00:59:05,621 --> 00:59:08,249
And that means that we've mapped
still only...

846
00:59:08,457 --> 00:59:11,392
...a very small volume
of the accessible universe...

847
00:59:11,593 --> 00:59:13,493
...the galaxies nearest to us.

848
00:59:13,696 --> 00:59:17,097
But pretty soon, we should be able to
extend this search out...

849
00:59:17,299 --> 00:59:18,891
...to enormous distances...

850
00:59:19,101 --> 00:59:21,501
...so far away in space,
that we're looking...

851
00:59:21,704 --> 00:59:25,299
...back to the time that galaxies
and their structures...

852
00:59:25,507 --> 00:59:26,735
...were first formed.

853
00:59:27,142 --> 00:59:29,633
And this poses a real problem.

854
00:59:29,845 --> 00:59:32,507
Most cosmologists hold
that the galaxies arise from...

855
00:59:32,715 --> 00:59:36,515
...a preexisting lumpiness
in the early universe...

856
00:59:36,719 --> 00:59:39,711
...with the little lumps
growing into galaxies.

857
00:59:39,922 --> 00:59:42,516
But the background radiation
from the big bang...

858
00:59:42,725 --> 00:59:44,192
...that fills all of space...

859
00:59:44,393 --> 00:59:46,987
...has now been carefully measured...

860
00:59:47,196 --> 00:59:50,723
...by that same Coby satellite
that took that picture.

861
00:59:51,233 --> 00:59:54,828
Now, those radio waves seem almost
perfectly uniform...

862
00:59:55,037 --> 00:59:56,334
...across the sky...

863
00:59:56,538 --> 01:00:00,099
...as if the big bang weren't
lumpy or granular at all.

864
01:00:00,309 --> 01:00:03,403
But if early radiation and matter
in the universe weren't lumpy...

865
01:00:03,612 --> 01:00:05,944
...how could individual galaxies form?

866
01:00:06,148 --> 01:00:07,945
How could the bubbles form?

867
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:09,674
Is there a contradiction...

868
01:00:09,885 --> 01:00:12,786
...between the uniformity
of the big bang radio waves...

869
01:00:12,988 --> 01:00:15,286
...and the bubble structures
formed by the galaxies?

870
01:00:15,491 --> 01:00:16,822
That's the question.

871
01:00:17,026 --> 01:00:20,962
When our survey of galaxies reaches
out to billions of light-years...

872
01:00:21,163 --> 01:00:23,461
...we'll have the answer
to this question.

873
01:00:23,766 --> 01:00:26,132
Incidentally, maybe you're thinking...

874
01:00:26,335 --> 01:00:29,702
...that the bubbles imply
a bubble maker.

875
01:00:32,441 --> 01:00:34,341
But then I'd have to ask you:

876
01:00:34,543 --> 01:00:36,170
"Who made the bubble maker?"

877
01:00:36,378 --> 01:00:39,711
There's another infinite regress
lurking here.

878
01:00:40,282 --> 01:00:42,341
And to one of
the grandest questions...

879
01:00:42,551 --> 01:00:45,486
...whether there's enough matter
in the universe to close it...

880
01:00:45,687 --> 01:00:48,087
...the only fair answer is
that we don't know.

881
01:00:48,290 --> 01:00:49,655
If it is closed...

882
01:00:49,858 --> 01:00:51,826
...what is the hidden matter
that's closing it?

883
01:00:52,027 --> 01:00:55,656
Is it faint stars, black holes,
massive neutrinos...

884
01:00:55,864 --> 01:00:59,595
...some exotic kind of dark matter
unknown on Earth?

885
01:00:59,802 --> 01:01:00,928
We don't know.

886
01:01:01,136 --> 01:01:05,232
But there are reasons to think
that we'll soon find out the answers.
