1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,030
What is it? Explain!

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:10,820
Our international telephone circuit project was called off!

3
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:12,730
What?

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,530
We got a call from the Ministry of Posts
and Telecommunications this morning!

5
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,980
We'll have to start all over
again for the authorization!

6
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:19,990
What does that
have to do with me?

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,960
Your manager was called into
an emergency director's meeting.

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,350
You met with Hirabayashi Junzaburo

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,230
yesterday, right?

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,010
So what about it!

11
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:30,770
That's the problem!

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,190
You'll be relieved of your position temporarily.

13
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,640
Please wait...

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,770
It's for one month.

15
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,480
When things settle down,
you may return.

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,750
I will apologize to Mr. Hirabayashi.

17
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,550
Please allow me to apologize!

18
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,410
There's no need.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,660
It's already
been decided.

20
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,320
Am I being transferred?

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,320
To our affiliate company--
A food processing factory.

22
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,590
Where is that
factory located?

23
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,680
l'm looking for a factory.

24
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,010
They went bankrupt
quite a while ago.

25
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,460
Are you all right?

26
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:54,930
Are you all right?

27
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:58,620
Are you all right?

28
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,000
You all seem to be relaxed
and laid back, but

29
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:09,360
People with that attitude
will be fired in 2 minutes.

30
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,890
Remember that.

31
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,830
Henceforth, at this factory...

32
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,690
Wait one moment!

33
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,150
We have work to do.

34
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,990
It's an important matter.

35
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,070
Let's put some spirit into it!

36
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,080
Is this the important
matter?

37
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,530
Would you like to
play with us?

38
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,670
Let's play baseball.

39
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,300
Section Chief Kubota
will not return

40
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,430
to the main office.

41
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,470
Manager Nagamine said
she'll commit suicide

42
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,130
with that factory.

43
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,730
I see...

44
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,590
What's the matter?

45
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,770
Is it all right for you
to come back?

46
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,810
l can't to stand still.

47
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,050
If I pause, I lose.

48
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,200
Did something happen
over there?

49
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,930
I like it...very much.

50
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,390
What kind of factory is it?

51
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:47,030
Well...it's like the club room
of a school's physical

52
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,720
education department.
It's filthy and smelly.

53
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,590
Everyone's goofing off.

54
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,470
If I stay there for 3 days,
my brain will rot.

55
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,530
Is it that bad?

56
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,360
Do you know what the
employees do?

57
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,010
They play baseball!

58
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:04,990
Play baseball?

59
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,420
It's a lineup of fools!

60
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,040
It's a factory that
manufactures

61
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,900
human scum.

62
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:29,960
Good morning.

63
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:33,420
May I help you?

64
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:40,400
I can't stay there forever.
I have work to do here.

65
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,880
There's the Australia ranch
buyout project, too...

66
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,760
Mr. Sakakibara, I want
to see the data.

67
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,820
That project has been
postponed indefinitely.

68
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,360
Why?

69
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,040
You should be well aware
of the circumstances.

70
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,630
When is a good time
to visit Kanto Foods?

71
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:02,930
Ms. Nogawa, what about the
contract with Daiya Foods

72
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,290
I asked you to process?

73
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,530
Show me the contract.

74
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,770
I made a decision
to cancel it.

75
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,140
Don't do things of
your own accord!

76
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,310
Upon examination of the
contract terms,

77
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,260
we won't make a
big enough profit.

78
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,680
We'll get a contract with
someone else.

79
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,760
Ms. Kubota, we're in the
middle of a meeting...

80
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,060
Is there something else?

81
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,070
Where are my floppy disks?

82
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,670
I'm sorry, I assumed
whatever you left behind

83
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,160
could be disposed of.

84
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,400
Leave this here. I'll be
back in one month.

85
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,390
Mr. Sakakibara, I want
you to send the daily

86
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,310
transaction data to
my computer.

87
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,720
I'll be reviewing them.

88
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:11,140
Don't misunderstand. I'm
still the Section Chief here!

89
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,590
Throw it away.

90
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,710
What is it?

91
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,100
Why do I have to
manufacture 200 yen

92
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,700
canned good,
when I was producing

93
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,040
annual transactions\of 2 billion yen?

94
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,660
Calm down.

95
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:50,620
I can't stand to be run over
by that woman.

96
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:54,820
It's only for a month, and
yet she's acting superior.

97
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,170
Should you be wasting
your time here?

98
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,270
That factory is in
financial trouble.

99
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,000
We may be able to obtain
30 tons of Angus beef

100
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,470
from Brisbane.

101
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,210
The Kansai office...?

102
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,350
They're waiting for our call.

103
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,840
Let's examine the route...

104
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,220
Who's in charge
in Brisbane?

105
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,110
Mr. Tanaka.

106
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,450
She came back
so suddenly.

107
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,900
I told you to look
out for her!

108
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:03,050
Chief, please
apologize for us.

109
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,790
Why do I have to
apologize?

110
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,300
There's nothing to
apologize for.

111
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,220
The factory can operate
even while we play.

112
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:13,670
You're right.

113
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,680
Don't you have
something to do?

114
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:38,310
You get paid for
working, right?

115
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,940
Please approve this.

116
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,140
What is this?

117
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,560
The budget for the
bon dance festival.

118
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,600
Bon dance festival?

119
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,560
We sponsor the annual
event in August.

120
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:15,120
I'd like to increase the number
of participating shops.

121
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,360
The budget's sort of high.
Is that okay?

122
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,960
We're not friends.

123
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,730
What does she mean?

124
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,960
Speak honorifically to her.

125
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,030
Honorifically...

126
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,740
Scrubbing brush...

127
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,830
We use it to wash
the machines.

128
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,660
Why do you need my
approval for a brush?

129
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:09,650
It's 100 yen a piece. If I buy
50, they sell it for 99 yen.

130
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:12,730
I'll be saving 50 yen. I
wanted your opinion

131
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,040
as to whether we
should buy in bulk.

132
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,830
Just buy as many
as you want!

133
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,500
Omuri-san!

134
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,540
Show me the financial
statements.

135
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,010
Financial statements?

136
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,530
Don't make me say it
more than once.

137
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,600
Why?

138
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,330
I want to know about
the factory!

139
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,700
You'll be here only
for one month.

140
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,110
You're wasting your time.

141
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,210
Nothing's wrong
with knowing.

142
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:43,520
I understand this
factory is dying.

143
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,760
This factory's not dying.

144
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,780
It's dead.

145
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,810
Show it to me.

146
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,920
Just give me the floppy
disk. I have a computer.

147
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,830
Isn't it on a floppy disk?

148
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,290
No one knows
how to use it.

149
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:23,320
We lost the instructions.

150
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:26,460
Word processors
are difficult to use.

151
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:31,160
It's called a computer.

152
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,090
What is it?

153
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,720
You want to know
about the factory?

154
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,180
Please come this way.

155
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,120
Please...

156
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:12,540
Let me explain. There are
8 different types of cans.

157
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:17,290
Recently, pocket
cans are popular.

158
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:19,460
They're manufactured for
single people and

159
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,820
have become the biggest
hit in the canning industry.

160
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:27,990
Our factory manufactures
sardines and saury.

161
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,800
However, we've been
manufacturing these boiled

162
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:34,350
mackerels
through the years.

163
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,140
It's seen quite frequently in
Southeast Asia.

164
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,790
Do you want to know more?

165
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,480
You do, right?

166
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,760
I'm not interested.

167
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,520
You want to know.

168
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,890
I hate mackerel!

169
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:48,610
Your face...

170
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:52,100
Have you been bitten
by it? It hurts.

171
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,770
I had food poisoning!

172
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,620
It's bringing
back memories...

173
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,650
Factory Chief!

174
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,950
Please listen to
my new product idea.

175
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,790
I have a lot of ideas.

176
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,570
Only if your idea is to
pack the employees of this

177
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,670
factory into a can, and
send them to Southeast Asia.

178
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,030
Factory Chief, would
you like some, too?

179
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,510
We have rice.

180
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,120
We have more than
enough canned food.

181
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,330
I'm eating out.

182
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,030
There aren't any
restaurants around here.

183
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,940
There's a
drive-in restaurant.

184
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,490
Then, I'll go there.

185
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,020
It's 2 kilometers away.

186
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,270
Excuse me...There's
supposed to be

187
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,210
a drive-in restaurant
around here.

188
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:03,130
Drive-in...Ah!
It's beyond that inn.

189
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:06,710
Factory Chief!

190
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,800
Leave me alone. I'll walk.

191
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,290
That's not it.

192
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:16,170
Your belongings
have arrived at the

193
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,230
company housing.

194
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,020
We're here.

195
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,100
Is this the
company housing?

196
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:54,950
Yes.

197
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,200
Why?

198
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,110
Please come in.

199
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,080
Please use these.

200
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,420
The factory chief is here.

201
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,630
I'm in the wave room.

202
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,070
Be careful. Sometimes the
boards come loose.

203
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,460
Please come this way.

204
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,750
What is this!

205
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,430
Come in.

206
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,740
Who opened my
personal belongings?

207
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,650
Did you open them?

208
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,490
You don't have
to thank me.

209
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,550
Don't touch other
people's things!

210
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,970
You've committed a crime!

211
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,000
He did it out of kindness.

212
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:11,350
If you're living
here, we're all family.

213
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,770
You've got to be kidding.
I can't live here.

214
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,210
It's a beautiful view.
When you open the window,

215
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:19,940
you'll know tomorrow's
weather forecast.

216
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,320
I'm not here to do
weather forecasting.

217
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,760
I'll look for an apartment!
Take me to a realtor.

218
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,640
There's no such thing here.

219
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,400
What about a hotel?

220
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:32,180
We have no tourists.

221
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,670
You have nothing?

222
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,400
Yes, there's nothing here.

223
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,990
If I have to sleep here...

224
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,200
I'll sleep with the crabs
on the seashore!

225
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,720
She's a beauty, but she
throws a straight ball.

226
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,780
I know it's a small place,
but let's try to get along.

227
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,630
Why do I have to
 get along with you?

228
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,240
I live here, too.

229
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,610
Why!

230
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,850
It's my home.
Isn't it, Dad!

231
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,700
Yes it is, Seitaro!

232
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,060
What are you doing?

233
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,760
I tried mixing mackerel,
miso and tomato.

234
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,840
It's very complex.

235
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:36,260
New ideas must
have impact.

236
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,210
Want to try some?

237
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:46,160
Is the factory chief
staying at your place?

238
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,270
Our place has a contract
for company housing.

239
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,310
I think I need more...

240
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:20,740
Doesn't it have impact?

241
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,210
It's delicious.

242
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,460
Typhoon 13 is huge,
possessing a lot of power.

243
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,040
At 12:00 p.m., near
the southwest area

244
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:38,520
of the Izu peninsula...

245
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,940
Typhoon season
is early this year.

246
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:45,530
Turn off the TV
and come here.

247
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,220
But there's a
typhoon nearby --

248
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,290
If it lands...

249
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,500
I don't care! Turn it off!

250
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:01,310
Those who underestimate
the typhoon, will pay for it.

251
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,890
Within the past year, there
have been numerous

252
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,020
missed payments
on bank notes.

253
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:12,020
Look at the bank liabilities...

254
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,400
This factory has
a deficit of nearly

255
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,030
a million yen annually.

256
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,650
I know, I've been doing
the books for 5 years.

257
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,050
How did this happen?

258
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,600
A drop in canned
goods consumption and

259
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,760
the deficiency in our
raw fish inventory.

260
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,490
Have you developed
a plan?

261
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,960
The lack of desire
for canned goods

262
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,020
is a product of the
change of times.

263
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:39,050
The deficiency in fish is
an environmental problem.

264
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,380
I want a a specific plan.

265
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,740
The change of time and
environmental problems

266
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,440
are uncontrollable...

267
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,540
Get real!

268
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,370
Don't get mad.

269
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:55,590
I'll only be here for one
month, so it doesn't matter.

270
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,350
To be honest, the
former factory chief

271
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,340
is a failure as a proprietor.

272
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,020
This factory is better
off closing down.

273
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,270
Wait! I'm still talking!

274
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,070
The typhoon is very near!

275
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,420
You're going to
play baseball, right?

276
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,360
If it rains, we can't practice!

277
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:19,090
Typhoon 13 possesses
enormous power...

278
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,120
As a result, the Kanto region
is experiencing severe rain...

279
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:36,380
I'll be here only until I find
a more suitable place.

280
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:39,600
Gen, from the local fishing
group said to give this

281
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,070
to you for dinner tonight.

282
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,240
I'm eating out!

283
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:46,660
There's nothing.

284
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:51,610
Leave me alone.
I'll find a place.

285
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:56,090
Be careful. There's a
typhoon coming...

286
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,700
There is a place...

287
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,860
Why?

288
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:08,720
Isn't this a convenience
store? You're supposed

289
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,210
to operate 24 Hours!

290
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,150
It's awful over there!
Help us!

291
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,990
Which way...?

292
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,380
Hey Dad! They need
help at the Harbor.

293
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:20,050
Seitoro. The factory chief
hasn't returned.

294
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,250
Hello.

295
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,230
This is Tokyo Chuo Taxi.

296
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,400
I'd like to request a taxi.

297
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:36,640
What is your address?

298
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,260
Chiba prefecture,
Kujukurihama...

299
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,530
Please stop joking.

300
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:09,990
Hideaki. Please come
for me. I can't get a taxi.

301
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:17,640
Can you hear me?
Hideaki! Please answer...

302
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,450
What else do you know?

303
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,410
I've told you everything.

304
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:44,030
You're so shocked,
you're speechless.

305
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,050
Your girlfriend is
a sacrificial offering.

306
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,990
I'm not shocked.

307
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,860
Companies do that.
The fault is in those

308
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,230
who get involved.

309
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,340
If I pause...

310
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,670
I lose.

311
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,160
It's the factory chief.

312
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:52,990
Factory Chief,
are you all right?

313
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,720
Factory Chief!

314
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,410
If I pause, I lose...

315
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:06,490
If I pause, I lose...

316
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,460
Chief! Chief! Chief!

317
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:17,320
What happened?

318
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:21,410
Did she die? I'm not
holding a funeral for her!

319
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:23,010
Don't kill her off!

320
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,270
Shall we take
her clothes off?

321
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,420
Do it!

322
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:29,540
Won't we be in trouble?

323
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,960
Warm her in a bath!

324
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,620
Did you find the
factory chief!

325
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,340
She's alive.

326
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,510
If I pause...

327
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:43,140
I lose...

328
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:49,070
She's been saying the
same thing over and over,

329
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:54,040
If I pause, I lose...

330
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,170
Dad is heating
the bath right now.

331
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,660
We've had fishing
boat disasters,

332
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:08,160
but never a
disaster on land.

333
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:12,850
It's suicidal, going out to
the seashore during a typhoon.

334
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:16,020
If she got engulfed by
the waves she'd be lost.

335
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:18,810
We had one like that,
last year. He went fishing...

336
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,840
He was from Tokyo.

337
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:23,880
The next day he washed up
on the other side of Neboseki.

338
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,490
I went to see him...

339
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:30,250
You like those
kinds of things...

340
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,030
I was excited. After
all, it's boring here.

341
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,120
If you die at a time
like this, does workmen's

342
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,100
compensation cover?

343
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,750
I don't think it does.

344
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,690
But if you were on your
way home from work,

345
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:41,740
isn't it all right?

346
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:44,370
I wonder how much
they'll pay if you die?

347
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,380
Do you want to try?

348
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,810
Leave!

349
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,630
You have no right
to make fun of me!

350
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,620
I graduated from
Keio University

351
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,010
and I'm the Foods Division
section chief at Godai Bussan.

352
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,450
I've had business dealings
with Australia and the U.S.

353
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:14,060
I've sealed annual
contracts of 20 billion yen...

354
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:19,320
I'm different from
you people, who

355
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,580
make dinky canned goods!
Don't take me for a fool!

356
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:24,110
I'm not like you! If you
came to laugh at me,

357
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,220
then leave!

358
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,560
I don't know what you're
angry at, but we didn't

359
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:38,490
come here to laugh at you.
We're worried about you.

360
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:43,150
Isn't it natural to come
to the rescue of your

361
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:45,680
fellow townsperson?

362
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,070
Let's go home.

363
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:58,050
Have you eaten yet?

364
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:00,950
During typhoons and field
trips, riceballs are the best!

365
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:02,690
You're all inconsiderate!

366
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:16,910
Have some. It's not pretty
but it's good.

367
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,120
What are you doing?

368
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:29,570
Remember this! I'm not
a member of this town.

369
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,440
Who does she think she is!

370
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:52,630
Gen, let's go home.

371
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,660
Hello.

372
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:16,360
It's me.

373
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:21,180
Hideaki....
I called you earlier.

374
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,810
What? The phone didn't ring.

375
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:27,820
What is it?

376
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,400
I found out...

377
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:31,920
The real reason
you were transferred.

378
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:42,690
I have a meeting to attend.
I only have 5 minutes,

379
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:48,050
They're making plans
to close down that factory.

380
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:49,500
Close down?

381
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,500
They're building a
new factory in Thailand.

382
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,960
Costs are lower and profits
higher with overseas factories.

383
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,150
It's the same as your
Australia ranch project.

384
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:00,970
But there's a reason why
they can't simply close it down.

385
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:04,750
If they close it down,
it'll upset the fishermen.

386
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,130
They're afraid of retaliation
by the local people.

387
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:10,010
They intend to convince
the local people that it was

388
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:12,410
closed due to financial
trouble and dismiss you

389
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:13,540
to appease them.

390
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:17,020
Why? That factory was in
trouble before I got there.

391
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:18,770
They knew that,
and sent you.

392
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,290
In one month, they'll make you
take responsibility and fire you.

393
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:26,450
The factory
will be shut down.

394
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:29,000
Everything's already
been planned.

395
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:34,040
Was it Nagamine's plan?

396
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:36,810
No, the manager's.

397
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:38,750
It's rumored that he'll
be promoted to the

398
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,210
auditor's office of
the Board of Directors.

399
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:48,080
Thank you for finding out.

400
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,500
Are you going to help me?

401
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,770
Don't misunderstand.

402
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,420
l was just an informant.

403
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,340
My five minutes are up.
I'm leaving.

404
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:06,300
If you were in my
shoes, you would've

405
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:08,200
done the same.

406
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,600
Of course. I don't want
your problem to

407
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:14,160
to undermine my
advancement opportunity.

408
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,660
I'm glad you understand.

409
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:46,190
The announcement of
the new factory will be in

410
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,560
one month. Is everything okay?

411
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:53,020
Ninth floor.

412
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,060
The elevator is going down.

413
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:08,070
You've planned this
from the beginning.

414
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,020
In one month, you're going
to force the responsibility

415
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,980
of the factory shut down
on me, right?

416
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,680
Eighth floor.

417
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,210
It's full.

418
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:21,730
The elevator is going down.

419
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:31,030
I know you're building
a factory in Thailand.

420
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,610
I'm the person in charge
of that project.

421
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:39,870
Hurry and close down
that distressed factory.

422
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,900
You have no right
to order me around.

423
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:46,970
Why don't you quit and
find another job?

424
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,170
I'll accept your resignation.

425
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,320
Or will you rebuild
that factory?

426
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,820
Sixth floor.

427
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:09,030
Sorry to burden you for
the sake of my advancement.

428
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:48,000
Are you going
to be our coach?

429
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,470
I won't allow you to play
baseball anymore.

430
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:07,590
You're going to work.

431
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:11,320
I'm going to work
you to the ground!

432
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:19,060
I'll create my own destiny.

433
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,600
