<i>Hydraulic systems deactivated.</i>

<i>Insulation cover open.</i>

4
00:06:29,554 --> 00:06:30,722
<i>Did you hear that?</i>

5
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:32,224
<i>What?</i>

6
00:06:32,808 --> 00:06:35,185
<i>- That. Did you hear that?
- No.</i>

7
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:37,646
<i>Electrical system activated.</i>

8
00:06:39,064 --> 00:06:40,148

<i>Second memory bank access open.</i>

11
00:06:49,074 --> 00:06:50,826
Prof. Klienman,
it's good to see you again.

12
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:52,827
- Good to see you, Major.
- Agents Wickett and Midford.

13
00:06:52,828 --> 00:06:53,948
- Professor.
- How do you do.

14
00:06:54,246 --> 00:06:56,123
Looks like we've got a malfunction...

15
00:06:56,206 --> 00:06:57,666
...on the aft sampler feed.

16
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,084
Try a reset.

17
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:01,503
Doctor, remember Major Bradley,
head of intelligence.

18
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,713
Major, how are you?

19
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:05,257
<i>Opening C-five container now.</i>

20
00:07:09,553 --> 00:07:10,762
<i>Three full loads.</i>

21
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:12,973
The gross weight discrepancy's
still there.

22
00:07:13,557 --> 00:07:14,725
Recheck the pre-stat.

23
00:07:14,808 --> 00:07:17,059
I've given it the auto test.
I've given it the manual test.

24
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,812
- It's still there.
- All right, let me see.

25
00:07:20,105 --> 00:07:22,316
Could you reset these
and give me one last...

26
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,533
You see any
little green monsters in there?

27
00:07:35,245 --> 00:07:36,913
<i>HMS samples look great.</i>

28
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,835
<i>Section seven, closing down.</i>

29
00:07:42,085 --> 00:07:44,046
Gross weight discrepancy's still there.

30
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:45,505
I've cross-checked everything.

31
00:07:46,673 --> 00:07:47,841
Let me see that.

32
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:51,345
<i>Changing codes on the function keys.</i>

33
00:07:51,428 --> 00:07:53,597
<i>Roger. Twenty megs left

37
00:08:09,196 --> 00:08:10,405
What happened?

38
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:14,326
<i>Seal it back up!</i>

39
00:08:14,409 --> 00:08:15,619
<i>What happened?</i>

40
00:08:15,702 --> 00:08:18,455
<i>I don't know!
I undid the panel and it blew!</i>

41
00:08:18,538 --> 00:08:19,873
<i>Come on, guys, shut it back!</i>

42
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:22,626
<i>Look out!
There's something in there!</i>

43
00:08:23,043 --> 00:08:25,545
<i>- What the hell?
- Don't move! Don't move!</i>

44
00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:28,882
Larry, back off.

45
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,759
Back off, Larry.
Get away from it.

46
00:08:30,842 --> 00:08:32,052
Reverse the aft sampler.

47
00:08:33,136 --> 00:08:34,638
<i>Back off! Back off!</i>

48
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,890
<i>You okay?</i>

49
00:08:36,932 --> 00:08:38,058
<i>Yeah, I'm okay.</i>

50
00:08:38,141 --> 00:08:40,227
<i>Look out!
Get out of here! Come on!</i>

51
00:08:40,435 --> 00:08:41,812
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

52
00:08:46,066 --> 00:08:48,193
Breakout, breakout.
We've got a problem here.

53
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,528
Do you see anything?

54
00:08:49,569 --> 00:08:51,071
Pull back to second perimeter.

55
00:08:51,154 --> 00:08:53,156
Repeat, pull back to second perimeter.

56
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,449
We have a breakout here.

57
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,867
<i>Code Red.</i>

58
00:08:58,954 --> 00:09:00,163
How many are there?

59
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,547
Keep still. Don't move.

60
00:09:27,232 --> 00:09:29,401
Stay back.
Stay away from them.

61
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,049
Open the doors to the left!

62
00:09:52,382 --> 00:09:53,592
Hey, to the right!

63
00:09:53,675 --> 00:09:54,927
Moving in!

64
00:10:00,974 --> 00:10:04,186
- Get ready!
- Wait! Hold your fire!

65
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:05,869
- Stay back! Stay back!
- Hold your fire!

66
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,314
Everybody hold your fire!

67
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,071
<i>Roger. We see him.</i>

68
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,448
<i>He's heading towards the north fence.</i>

69
00:10:18,325 --> 00:10:20,577
<i>Holy smoke!
What the hell is that?</i>

70
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:24,122
<i>He's hung up on the fence!</i>

71
00:10:34,758 --> 00:10:36,635
Look out!
It's on the windshield!

72
00:10:36,885 --> 00:10:38,303
Look out, Dad!

73
00:10:39,721 --> 00:10:41,139
We're gonna crash, Dad!

74
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:44,309
Oh, no! Look out!

75
00:10:47,771 --> 00:10:49,940
Oh, my God!

76
00:10:51,566 --> 00:10:52,859
Look out!

77
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,654
Look out!

78
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,955
Stay here, okay? You okay?

79
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:13,547
A fire extinguisher!
Do you have a fire extinguisher?

80
00:11:13,797 --> 00:11:15,340
I've got one! I've got one!

81
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,175
- Here!
- Hey, get away, get away!

82
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,510
It might blow, come on.

83
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:33,984
Come on, that's it.

84
00:11:34,484 --> 00:11:36,361
Close your mouth.
Close your eyes.

85
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,113
It's okay.

86
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:56,673
Looks like a biggie.

87
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,299
Well, Mom, get in that lane,
follow 'em down.

88
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,676
Will you guys just stop it?

89
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,054
Can we get down and watch?

90
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:03,764
No way.

91
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,265
Is anybody hurt?

92
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,725
Nah, nothing serious, lady.

93
00:12:06,808 --> 00:12:08,518
Something just ran across the road.

94
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,191
I tell ya, I'm not crazy.

95
00:12:14,232 --> 00:12:15,358
It looked like an omelet with two eyes.

96
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,567
It must've been some sort of alien.

97
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:18,153
My dad, he's telling the truth...!

98
00:12:18,236 --> 00:12:19,655
Think it was a drunk?

99
00:12:20,155 --> 00:12:22,991
- It's probably an ADUl.
- What?

100
00:12:23,158 --> 00:12:25,202
An alien driving under the influence.

101
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:31,757
We need the paramedics here
when you get time.

102
00:12:32,292 --> 00:12:34,085
<i>- It'll be midnight...
- Okay, bring it up, bring it up.</i>

103
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,879
<i>It's gonna be backed up for hours.</i>

104
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,563
Good evening, miss.
Everything all right?

105
00:12:38,173 --> 00:12:40,008
- You tell me.
- This won't take a minute.

106
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,391
All right, you can go.
Go on.

107
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:50,936
Next car.
Come on, let's pull up. Quickly.

108
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:54,147
Wonder what they were looking for?

109
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:58,652
Omelets... with eyes.

110
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,948
Wow! He jumped over two cars!

111
00:13:03,031 --> 00:13:05,325
And nobody got hurt? Yeah, right.

112
00:13:05,742 --> 00:13:08,161
That car's flat! Jeez!

113
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:10,455
Okay, give it back, Mike.

114
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:11,581
What?

115
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:14,459
- He took my Coke, Mom.
- Come on, you guys.

116
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,169
I don't have it.
I didn't take it.

117
00:13:17,212 --> 00:13:18,880
- I knew it!
- Gross!

118
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,174
- That wasn't me.
- Who was it, then?

119
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,761
- Mom...?
- It wasn't me!

120
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,305
I'm onto you!

121
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,432
Come on, Mike, give it back.

122
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,108
- Mom.
- Thanks.

123
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,362
Eric, wake up.
We're almost there.

124
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:27,449
- Eric.
- All right.

125
00:14:30,702 --> 00:14:32,746
Hey, look at all the cars.

126
00:14:33,288 --> 00:14:34,998
This looks pretty nice.

127
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,125
Pretty nice.

128
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,452
- Great hill for the wheels, man.
- Yeah!

129
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,161
No, you're not going down
any hills until we've...

130
00:15:14,162 --> 00:15:15,247
...checked it out, okay?

131
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,623
I know, Mom.

132
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,209
Okay, we're almost here.
Close your eyes, guys.

133
00:15:19,626 --> 00:15:20,669
Close 'em.

134
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,755
Oh, there's a pretty girl.

135
00:15:24,172 --> 00:15:26,174
I said close 'em, you cheaters.

136
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:27,843
Come on.

137
00:15:28,051 --> 00:15:30,262
You guys are gonna love this place.

138
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:33,140
Okay, you can open 'em.

139
00:15:35,475 --> 00:15:36,518
Kitty, kitty.

140
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,145
Wow! Top of the hill!

141
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,063
Cool, check it out!
Two-car garage!

142
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,024
Yes, it's the chauffeur's day off!

143
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,191
Can we afford this?

144
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:46,320
No, we can't, Eric. That's why
I'm forced to sell your brother.

145
00:15:46,486 --> 00:15:48,405
- Tough break, Mike.
- Hey!

146
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,868
That's my stuff you're
throwing around there.

147
00:15:52,909 --> 00:15:55,662
Relax, lady.
It's just our furniture pads.

148
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,873
Oh. Sorry.

149
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,459
Bring the groceries in, guys, okay?

150
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,753
- I like it.
- Me too.

151
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,088
Hey, how's it going?

152
00:16:06,673 --> 00:16:08,967
We're communing with the earth spirits.

153
00:16:11,219 --> 00:16:12,304
Right.

154
00:16:12,387 --> 00:16:15,432
- Welcome to California, bud.
- Really.

155
00:16:15,807 --> 00:16:16,892
Here.

156
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:19,853
Aren't you gonna carry anything?

157
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:22,105
Sure. I've got my skateboard.

158
00:16:22,814 --> 00:16:25,067
Let's go.
Hello, California women.

159
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,487
Have no fear,
your hormonal hero is here.

160
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:47,047
Oh, my God!

161
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:51,385
- Oh, great house, man.
- I can't see anything.

162
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,989
Put the stuff over on the table, guys.

163
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,138
- You'll love it.
- Ceiling looks good.

164
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,598
Yeah, well, check it out.

165
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,017
This is totally rad!

166
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,561
Is this gonna get me a great
Mother's Day present, or what?

167
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,313
You really scored big, Mom.

168
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,648
Look over here.

169
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,316
Hey, is that all ours?

170
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,402
Yeah, about the first 25 yards of it.

171
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:11,071
You think there's any
wild animals out there?

172
00:17:11,154 --> 00:17:12,406
Definitely, definitely.

173
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,866
- Some big grizzly bears.
- Yeah, there's probably some.

174
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,661
- Alligators, big nasty ones.
- Are you guys kidding?

175
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,912
- Maybe a couple of gorillas.
- Penguins, penguins.

176
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,540
Maybe a werewolf.

177
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:23,959
- Yeah, right.
- Hey, Mom, where's my room?

178
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:25,294
It's down the hall.

179
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,754
Watch the door.

180
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,132
Did you notice, my dear,
that there is not one step...

181
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,676
...in the entire place?

182
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,761
Low counters.

183
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,430
Wide hallways.

184
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,765
And you can see out of every window.

185
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:41,018
And, baby, you ain't seen nothing yet!

186
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:51,862
- Okay?
- Oh yeah, it's great!

187
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:53,154
Did you see the size of these closets?

188
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,531
I'm gonna need more clothes!

189
00:17:54,906 --> 00:17:56,408
Yeah, we'll put you on the list.

190
00:17:56,491 --> 00:17:57,534
Thanks.

191
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,583
What do you think, huh?

192
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,042
I thought we'd put the bed
right over here.

193
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,627
That way you just wake up
every morning...

194
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,211
...and see the sun coming
over the mountains.

195
00:18:09,212 --> 00:18:10,589
You did great, Mom.

196
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:12,716
Thank you.

197
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,242
Want some lunch?

198
00:18:39,534 --> 00:18:41,745
Ah, no thanks. I'm fine.

199
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,509
Ah, your mom said this is your TV.

200
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,928
You want me to hook it up for you?

201
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,305
No, I can handle it.
Just put it down over there.

202
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,556
You got it.

203
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,030
<i>There's Tooter Shellby on Sea Snail...</i>

204
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,033
<i>...or is it the other way around?</i>

205
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,956
<i>Casey Kelp on Clamdancer.</i>

206
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,333
<i>Junior Wetworth riding Snorkaway.</i>

207
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,630
<i>And Allstar Seaworthy atop Seabiscuit.</i>

208
00:20:58,632 --> 00:20:59,925
<i>They're all in line.</i>

209
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,593
Here's your T.O.W.

210
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:02,886
My what?

211
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,096
Tuna On Wholewheat.

212
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:06,306
Oh. Thanks.
Hey, come look at this.

213
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,809
<i>...Allstar Seaworthy,
grabbing an early lead...</i>

214

215
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,021
That's very good.

216
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,649
It didn't do that last time.
It stayed on.

217
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:21,571
Yeah, well, if it happens again,
let me know.

218
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:29,871
<i>And as they approach the home stretch...</i>

219
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:16,520
- Hi.
- Hi.

220
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,773
- You looking for your friend?
- Yeah!

221
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,275
He went down the hill.

222
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:24,569
- Did you get a good look at him?
- Yeah, he's real cute.

223
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:26,571
What did he look like?

224
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,155
He's your friend,
and you don't even know...

225
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,366
...what he looks like?

226
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,119
I was just kidding.
He's my brother.

227
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:35,664
Your brother?
Where are you from?

228
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,165
Illinois.

229
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,959
Welcome to the neighborhood.

230
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:41,211
Looks like you'll be
an interesting addition.

231
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:42,754
Hey, Deb, time to eat.

232
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,006
Okay.

233
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:46,258
I've got to go. What's your name?

234
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,759
- Eric.
- I'm Debbie.

235
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,553
This is my sister Courtney.

236
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,138
- Hi.
- Hi.

237
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:53,432
- We'll talk later.
- Okay.

238
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,017
- See ya.
- Bye.

239
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,101
Come on.

240
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:57,436
What happened in here?

241
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,605
- Did you just go down the hill?
- No.

242
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,982
Mom is gonna freak out.

243
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:04,109
There's something weird going on.

244
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:06,069
- Look at this.
- What?

245
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:08,196
There were footprints here.

246
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,907
Somebody was just in my bathroom
taking a shower.

247
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:13,201
Yeah, right. You think she's
gonna go for that, huh?

248
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,620
I'm serious.

249
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:16,955
The TV went on, and it
wasn't even plugged in.

250
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,208
I'm not joking, Michael.

251
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,127
Who broke the lamp?

252
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,296
Well, Sherlock Holmes here
thinks he saw a ghost.

253
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:25,756
Oh, did the ghost do it?

254
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,926
Something was just in my bedroom.
It jumped over my head.

255
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:31,637
- Yeah, right.
- What thing?

256
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:34,556
I never saw it.
It just kept doing things.

257
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:37,684
I'm not lying, Mom. I swear it.

258
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:24,591
Right. I've got something better
for the fireplace, anyway.

259
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:26,525
It's Harvey!

260
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:02,269
Eric, you asleep?

261
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:03,729
Uh-uh.

262
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:20,996
Now, come on. I want you
to stop worrying about this.

263
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,956
Did you lock all the windows?

264
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,709
- Yes.
- Good.

265
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:29,463
I was thinking maybe it wasn't
such a bad thing, anyway.

266
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:33,133
All it did was take a shower
and drink a soda.

267
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,344
Well, maybe it was one of the
neighborhood kids or something.

268
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:38,639
I'm sure there's a rational explanation.

269
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,184
Come on, try and get some sleep, huh?

270
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:44,061
It's been a long day.

271
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,808
Michael?

272
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:20,694
Oh, my God!

273
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:33,040
Michael, Eric, what have you done?

274
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,458
I didn't do it, Mom.

275
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,084
Oh, my...

276
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:39,212
Oh, this is my mother's painting!

277
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,964
It's a hundred years old!

278
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:42,591
Whoa! What happened in here?

279
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:45,844
Everything's ruined!

280
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:47,220
It's totally ruined!

281
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:50,098
It wasn't me, Mom! It was
the little creature! I saw it!

282
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,976
The house is totally destroyed!

283
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,227
What do you want me to say?

284
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:56,396
I don't want you to say anything!

285
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:57,940
Well, calm down, Mom.

286
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:00,609
This is incredible. It's insane.
I don't believe it.

287
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:03,737
Look at this. Oh, my God.
I'm going back to bed.

288
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,322
What the heck happened, man?

289
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:31,491
Eric!

290
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:39,041
Stop it, Eric, stop!

291
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:46,924
Eric!

292
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:50,802
Oh, my God!

293
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,512
Eric!

294
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:54,681
Eric!

295
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,892
- Come on.
- Eric, swim!

296
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:00,896
Swim to the side, Eric! Swim!

297
00:33:01,355 --> 00:33:02,940
Mom! Mom!

298
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:06,193
Swim! Swim, Eric!

299
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:11,239
No! Eric!

300
00:33:14,785 --> 00:33:15,953
What is it?

301
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,246
Eric!

302
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:40,018
Eric, look at me!
Say something!

303
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:43,105
- Did you see him?
- What?

304
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:44,773
The little creature!

305
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:46,817
I can't believe he did this.

306
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:48,234
He's all right, Mom.
I'll go get him.

307
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:50,529
No, no. Just go and get some help.

308
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:54,491
<i>2-17, paramedics on the way.</i>

309
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,665
I don't know why he did it.
I just saw him go.

310
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:05,127
Deep breath? Good.

311
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:06,378
One more.

312
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,172
Oh, fine. Now sit back.

313
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:11,800
- How's your head feel?
- Fine.

314
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,051
No dizziness?

315
00:34:13,594 --> 00:34:15,304
I want you to follow this
with your eyes.

316
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:18,682
Good. Once more.

317
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:20,976
Fine.

318
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:22,477
You're a lucky young man.

319
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:24,563
Everything seems to be okay.

320
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,441
Could you leave us alone for a minute?

321
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,866
Your mother tells me that
you've been seeing some things.

322
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:38,660
Can you tell me about it?

323
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,163
You wouldn't believe it.

324
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:42,748
Try me.

325
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:46,960
It's a little creature.

326
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:49,087
Do you see him often?

327
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:51,673
Just the things that he does.

328
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:54,051
Has anyone else
seen this little creature?

329
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:56,386
Just Debbie.
She's the girl next door.

330
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:01,016
I'm gonna give you this ah,
mild sedative.

331
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:02,684
It'll help you get some rest.

332
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,979
Why don't you just ask Debbie?
She knows all about it.

333
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:07,564
Here, you take this.

334
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:11,318
And we'll discuss all that later, okay?

335
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,865
You get that rest.

336
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,618
I'll come back to see you soon.

337
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:27,793
He's not your brother, is he?

338
00:35:28,377 --> 00:35:30,254
Why didn't you tell them
that you saw him?

339
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:32,381
Because nobody would believe it.

340
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:34,549
What is he, some sort of ghost?

341
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,218
I don't know what he is.

342
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:37,886
You should have backed me up.

343
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,805
It wouldn't do any good.

344
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:41,974
They only believe
what they want to believe.

345
00:35:42,224 --> 00:35:44,726
They already think
you've got schizo-freakia.

346
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:46,853
Schizo what?

347
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:48,105
Freakia.

348
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:50,524
It's when you see people
that really aren't there.

349
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:52,985
Well, I'm gonna prove it to everyone.

350
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,528
I'm gonna catch him.

351
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:57,072
Can I come in?

352
00:35:57,281 --> 00:35:58,365
Sure.

353
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:00,742
Sorry to hear what happened.

354
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:02,286
You look okay.

355
00:36:02,536 --> 00:36:03,787
I'm fine.

356
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:05,247
Mom wants to go, Deb.

357
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:07,749
Okay. I'll see you later.

358
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,167
Give me a call.

359
00:36:10,711 --> 00:36:13,547
Hey, why don't you invite Eric
to Brittany's birthday tomorrow.

360
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:15,549
- You want to come?
- Sure.

361
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:17,426
Okay, I'll see you then.

362
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:19,219
Bye. I'm glad you're okay.

363
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:20,470
Bye.

364
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:24,266
- Hi.
- Hi.

365
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,184
I'm Michael, Eric's brother.

366
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:28,478
I'm Courtney, Deb's sister.

367
00:36:28,604 --> 00:36:30,272
- Yeah.
- Nice meeting you.

368
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:31,607
Me too.

369
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:35,110
- McDonald's, huh?
- Yeah.

370
00:36:35,444 --> 00:36:37,863
Why don't you stop by for a Big Mac?

371
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:39,948
Let's go.

372
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:44,077
You never told me about her.

373
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:54,962
I knew I shouldn't have
taken this job right now.

374
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:56,673
Mom, it's gonna be fine.

375
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,926
- Are you getting a draft?
- Uh-uh.

376
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:00,302
I'm rolling up the window.

377
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:01,553
You should be in bed, anyway.

378
00:37:01,595 --> 00:37:03,764
- I'm fine.
- Michael!

379
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:06,516
Hey, look out, you idiot!

380
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,850
I saw it, Mom.
I had plenty of room.

381
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:09,478
What is the matter with you today?

382
00:37:11,438 --> 00:37:13,481
I'm gonna have to hire somebody
to take care of you guys.

383
00:37:13,482 --> 00:37:16,151
- I can be on my own, Mom.
- That's it. Not if I can help it.

384
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:18,238
Well, Debbie's mom said
she could look after him.

385
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:20,155
Okay, we're here.

386
00:37:20,781 --> 00:37:21,949
I should have called in sick.

387
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:24,409
You can't call in sick
on your first day.

388
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,995
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Guaranteed.

389
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:30,040
Listen, I'm getting out at nine.
Mr. Allen is bringing me home.

390
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:32,793
- Please be there, guys.
- We'll be there, Mom.

391
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:35,170
I'm not ready for this.

392
00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:37,214
Mom, relax.
You've already got the job.

393
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:39,591
- You look great.
- Thanks.

394
00:37:41,385 --> 00:37:43,095
Never seen her this tense before.

395
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,555
Yeah, well, it's her first job
in ten years.

396
00:37:45,973 --> 00:37:48,225
- You know what I feel like?
- A Big Mac?

397
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:50,852
- The man is a genius.
- I'm psychic!

398
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:52,312
I tell ya!

399
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,883
That's over, though, you know,
she's in Indiana...

400
00:39:02,925 --> 00:39:04,217
...I'm here, she's there.

401
00:39:06,053 --> 00:39:08,013
Well, you know,
that doesn't really matter.

402
00:39:08,055 --> 00:39:11,016
So... let's talk about you.
Are you dating anyone?

403
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:14,186
Good.

404
00:39:14,478 --> 00:39:15,729
What are you doing right now?

405
00:39:16,647 --> 00:39:18,065
Oh. What subject?

406
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:20,901
Oh, I'm that's... that's
sort of my subject.

407
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:23,111
You know, I can help you if
you want some help.

408
00:39:23,612 --> 00:39:24,821
Come on over.

409
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,989
What are you doing here?

410
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:09,658
- Did you catch him?
- Not yet.

411
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:12,327
- I want to help.
- What about your mom?

412
00:40:12,411 --> 00:40:14,830
I'm not going to tell her.
Who's that?

413
00:40:15,122 --> 00:40:17,708
It's just my old Chicago Cubs mascot.

414
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:21,086
Here, you can carry
the equipment. Put this on.

415
00:40:22,504 --> 00:40:23,839
What are we going to do?

416
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:25,340
It's just a precaution.

417
00:40:25,424 --> 00:40:27,593
I think you should know I bruise easily.

418
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:40,939
Get those cords! Come on!

419
00:40:41,732 --> 00:40:44,443
You still haven't told me
what we're going to do.

420
00:40:44,526 --> 00:40:46,570
Here, strap this vacuum cleaner
on your back.

421
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:48,071
We're gonna suck him up.

422
00:40:57,247 --> 00:40:59,207
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

423
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:35,953
You ready?

424
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:40,248
Hit it.

425
00:41:41,917 --> 00:41:44,378
Charge!

426
00:41:44,461 --> 00:41:47,005
You got him!
Don't hurt him!

427
00:41:47,923 --> 00:41:49,883
You're hurting him!

428
00:41:50,259 --> 00:41:51,718
We got him!

429
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:54,096
Get me off of this thing!

430
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:55,973
Debbie!

431
00:41:57,641 --> 00:42:00,102
- Debbie! Debbie!
- I'm dizzy.

432
00:42:00,978 --> 00:42:02,229
Debbbie!

433
00:42:02,396 --> 00:42:03,939
Michael!

434
00:42:07,776 --> 00:42:10,028
Hey! What's going on?

435
00:42:11,989 --> 00:42:14,324
Get me off of this thing!

436
00:42:15,534 --> 00:42:17,703
Turn it off! Stop it!

437
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,832
Get this off of me!

438
00:42:21,915 --> 00:42:24,918
- Are you okay?
- Would you get me off of here?

439
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:27,087
I think I'm gonna throw up.

440
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:29,673
Would somebody please tell me
what is happening?

441
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:30,924
He's in the vacuum.

442
00:42:31,008 --> 00:42:32,467
What? What are you talking about?

443
00:42:32,718 --> 00:42:34,761
It's the thing I've been
telling you about-the MAC.

444
00:42:34,845 --> 00:42:35,929
The what?

445
00:42:36,013 --> 00:42:37,764
The Mysterious Alien Creature.

446
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:40,142
You've got to get him out of there.

447
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:41,685
Plug it back in.

448
00:42:41,727 --> 00:42:43,145
Wait, Eric, what are you gonna do?

449
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:46,273
Just do it.
I'm gonna reverse the motor.

450
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:33,612
Get me a drink.

451
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:44,790
We hurt him bad, didn't we?

452
00:43:44,873 --> 00:43:46,083
It's okay.

453
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,085
He looks tired.

454
00:43:50,712 --> 00:43:53,257
This is unreal.
This is incredible, guys.

455
00:43:53,423 --> 00:43:56,051
This must be like what they drink
on their own planet.

456
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:58,178
Where'd he come from?

457
00:43:58,262 --> 00:43:59,388
I don't know.

458
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:01,265
He came in the van with you.

459
00:44:01,682 --> 00:44:03,809
I saw him when you first got here.

460
00:44:03,892 --> 00:44:06,353
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I thought you knew.

461
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:08,479
Wait a minute. This is what
they were looking for...

462
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,899
...back at the accident.
That's Mom.

463
00:44:11,066 --> 00:44:12,906
- What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna tell her.

464
00:44:13,026 --> 00:44:17,114
Don't tell her about me, please!
My mom will go crazy!

465
00:44:17,239 --> 00:44:18,991
Okay, split, Debbie. Go!

466
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:22,744
I'm sorry we set you up.

467
00:44:23,495 --> 00:44:25,122
I'll see you later.

468
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:31,295
There must be a power failure.

469
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:33,005
What happened?
All our lights are out.

470
00:44:37,426 --> 00:44:39,678
It's okay. It's just my mom!

471
00:44:39,761 --> 00:44:40,804
Come back!

472
00:44:41,847 --> 00:44:42,931
What's going on?

473
00:44:43,849 --> 00:44:46,059
Power's surging
in the whole neighborhood.

474
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,520
- Michael?
- Yeah.

475
00:44:48,604 --> 00:44:49,688
Is everything okay?

476
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:51,648
Fine, but you'd better
come look at something.

477
00:44:51,732 --> 00:44:52,857
What's the matter? Where's Eric?

478
00:44:52,858 --> 00:44:55,068
- Ah, he's fine. He's over here.
- Where is he?

479
00:44:55,277 --> 00:44:57,863
What are you doing on the floor?
What is all this smoke?

480
00:44:57,946 --> 00:44:59,656
He ran off again!

481
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:00,780
It's Eric's friend, Mom...

482
00:45:00,824 --> 00:45:02,408
...the one he's been trying
to tell us about.

483
00:45:02,409 --> 00:45:04,286
They caught him in the vacuum cleaner.

484
00:45:04,828 --> 00:45:06,413
- They?
- We.

485
00:45:08,248 --> 00:45:10,542
Okay, let's start from
the beginning again, shall we?

486
00:45:10,626 --> 00:45:12,252
Can I have my chair first, please?

487
00:45:12,336 --> 00:45:13,629
Go get him his chair.

488
00:45:13,754 --> 00:45:15,422
I sucked him up in the vacuum...

489
00:45:15,631 --> 00:45:17,674
...to prove to everyone that he exists.

490
00:45:18,592 --> 00:45:20,427
He's not lying, Mom. I saw it.

491
00:45:22,429 --> 00:45:25,933
You sucked this living thing
into a vacuum cleaner?

492
00:45:26,266 --> 00:45:28,685
Yeah, and then we blew him out again!

493
00:45:28,769 --> 00:45:30,187
It's the truth, Mom.

494
00:45:30,979 --> 00:45:32,105
No, I can handle it.

495
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:35,359
I can, really. I can handle it.

496
00:45:56,463 --> 00:45:57,714
Morning.

497
00:46:04,054 --> 00:46:06,348
Strange-looking pets
in this neighborhood.

498
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:09,202
Mike! Hey, Mike, wake up.
Looks like he came back.

499
00:47:09,286 --> 00:47:11,371
- Who?
- The little creature. Come on!

500
00:47:11,455 --> 00:47:13,040
Ah, cool!

501
00:47:14,374 --> 00:47:16,752
Wow! He cleaned up everything!

502
00:47:18,253 --> 00:47:19,296
Wow!

503
00:47:19,546 --> 00:47:21,632
- You think he did it?
- Hey, I sure didn't.

504
00:47:22,007 --> 00:47:23,717
Check out the door!

505
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,427
Glad we didn't kill the little dude!

506
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:27,471
Yeah, he even fixed Mom's old painting.

507
00:47:27,554 --> 00:47:28,972
And look at the ceiling!

508
00:47:29,056 --> 00:47:32,017
Hey, we should rent this guy out.
We'd be millionaires!

509
00:47:32,601 --> 00:47:35,520
Look at this. What is it?

510
00:47:35,812 --> 00:47:37,813
I don't know. Looks like
he's trying to tell us something.

511
00:47:37,814 --> 00:47:40,108
I bet it's got something to do
with where he came from.

512
00:47:40,442 --> 00:47:43,362
A Wickes Furniture store?
And what about these?

513
00:47:43,487 --> 00:47:44,905
Maybe he likes horses.

514
00:47:45,155 --> 00:47:49,076
This is incredible.
I don't believe it.

515
00:47:51,161 --> 00:47:53,372
Thanks, you guys.
I really appreciate it.

516
00:47:54,915 --> 00:47:57,042
We didn't do it, Mom.
He came back.

517
00:47:57,334 --> 00:47:59,503
Come on.
Are you telling me this thing...

518
00:47:59,544 --> 00:48:01,213
...came in and cleaned up the house?

519
00:48:01,463 --> 00:48:04,132
Think about it.
Would we do something like this?

520
00:48:07,094 --> 00:48:08,303
That's a good point.

521
00:48:08,929 --> 00:48:11,682
He left these. We think it's
some kind of message.

522
00:48:11,765 --> 00:48:13,891
It's that thing they were looking
for back at the crash site...

523
00:48:13,892 --> 00:48:14,893
...I'm telling you.

524
00:48:14,977 --> 00:48:17,145
It's an alien, like the guy said.

525
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:21,024
You still don't believe us, do you?

526
00:48:23,151 --> 00:48:24,528
Come on, guys.

527
00:48:25,988 --> 00:48:29,491
I believe there's something,
but the question is what.

528
00:50:12,761 --> 00:50:14,680
Come on, Mom, let's go!

529
00:50:16,265 --> 00:50:18,934
- How far do you want to go?
- How about to the next driveway?

530
00:50:19,476 --> 00:50:21,895
Come on, let's go down to the
bottom of the hill and back.

531
00:50:22,229 --> 00:50:24,189
Okay. I'm gonna beat you.

532
00:50:24,439 --> 00:50:25,857
Wanna make a bet?

533
00:50:30,862 --> 00:50:33,615
Good dogs. Good dogs.
Stay where you are.

534
00:50:34,658 --> 00:50:35,742
Come on.

535
00:50:44,626 --> 00:50:47,129
Eric! Eric!

536
00:50:48,714 --> 00:50:50,340
I don't think he saw me.

537
00:50:54,511 --> 00:50:55,929
What is that?

538
00:50:56,597 --> 00:50:58,056
Don't hit him!

539
00:50:58,307 --> 00:51:00,392
What is he, crazy or something?

540
00:51:03,979 --> 00:51:07,691
What was that? I've never
seen anything like it.

541
00:51:51,944 --> 00:51:56,990
<i>Tired of feeling all by myself</i>

542
00:51:58,033 --> 00:52:02,871
<i>Being so different from everyone else</i>

543
00:52:04,039 --> 00:52:08,961
<i>Somehow you knew I needed your help</i>

544
00:52:10,837 --> 00:52:15,842
<i>Be my friend forever</i>

545
00:52:17,636 --> 00:52:22,683
<i>I never found my star in the night</i>

546
00:52:23,809 --> 00:52:28,647
<i>Living my dreams was far from my sight</i>

547
00:52:29,856 --> 00:52:34,695
<i>You came along and I saw the light</i>

548
00:52:36,613 --> 00:52:40,951
<i>We'll be friends forever</i>

549
00:52:43,036 --> 00:52:47,916
<i>I can't face the thought of you leaving</i>

550
00:52:49,042 --> 00:52:54,756
<i>So take me along I swear I'll be strong</i>

551
00:52:54,923 --> 00:53:00,429
<i>If you take me wherever you go</i>

552
00:53:01,597 --> 00:53:06,476
<i>I want to learn the things that you know</i>

553
00:53:07,686 --> 00:53:11,064
<i>You know whatever you do</i>

554
00:53:12,232 --> 00:53:14,192
<i>I'll follow you</i>

555
00:53:17,779 --> 00:53:19,323
Get your shoes on, we gotta go.

556
00:53:20,574 --> 00:53:21,825
Anything?

557
00:53:22,451 --> 00:53:24,745
Maybe he went to haunt somebody else.

558
00:53:24,828 --> 00:53:26,330
That's not even funny, Mom.

559
00:53:26,413 --> 00:53:27,623
Sorry.

560
00:53:30,542 --> 00:53:31,543
Hello.

561
00:53:33,003 --> 00:53:34,338
Yeah, he's ready.

562
00:53:34,922 --> 00:53:36,089
Okay. Bye-bye.

563
00:53:37,507 --> 00:53:39,551
Eric, that was Debbie.
She's on her way.

564
00:53:39,676 --> 00:53:40,969
- You ready?
- Yeah.

565
00:53:42,679 --> 00:53:44,556
Gonna have a good time
at the party today?

566
00:53:48,018 --> 00:53:49,101
Did you remember to lock the back?

567
00:53:49,102 --> 00:53:50,770
- Yeah, I got it.
- Water and Power, ma'am.

568
00:53:50,771 --> 00:53:52,355
We're looking into
last night's blackout.

569
00:53:52,356 --> 00:53:53,774
Can we check your power boxes?

570
00:53:54,232 --> 00:53:55,358
Sure. They're around the back.

571
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:57,069
Thanks. It'll just take a minute.

572
00:53:57,611 --> 00:54:01,198
Mrs. Cruise, did you notice
anything unusual last night?

573
00:54:02,115 --> 00:54:03,200
Like what?

574
00:54:03,283 --> 00:54:05,076
What were you doing
when the blackout occurred?

575
00:54:05,077 --> 00:54:07,287
- I was driving up the street.
- I see.

576
00:54:07,496 --> 00:54:08,580
Thank you.

577
00:54:09,373 --> 00:54:11,583
Mom, that's the guy from
the crash in the desert.

578
00:54:11,667 --> 00:54:12,793
Don't you recognize him?

579
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,921
Remember? He was the one
looking in all the cars.

580
00:54:16,129 --> 00:54:17,673
Doesn't it seem a little weird?

581
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:19,508
- Hi.
- Hi, Debbie.

582
00:54:19,716 --> 00:54:21,175
My Mom wants to leave in five minutes.

583
00:54:21,176 --> 00:54:23,053
Okay, fine. Come on, we've got to go.

584
00:54:23,553 --> 00:54:26,014
Ah, I'll pick you up at the party later.

585
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,808
Listen, don't forget the present
I left for you on the table, huh?

586
00:54:28,809 --> 00:54:31,061
And call me. I want to know
what's going on.

587
00:54:35,399 --> 00:54:37,484
So what happened?
Where is he?

588
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:39,778
Shhh. Come on.

589
00:54:51,164 --> 00:54:52,332
It's here.

590
00:54:52,457 --> 00:54:54,209
Get Rankin
and the capture group up here.

591
00:54:54,668 --> 00:54:56,295
This is 100 X-Ray.

592
00:54:56,712 --> 00:54:58,338
Think they followed you here?

593
00:54:58,630 --> 00:54:59,923
I don't know.

594
00:55:00,007 --> 00:55:01,717
I bet they're looking for him.

595
00:55:02,843 --> 00:55:04,886
Maybe that's why he's so scared.

596
00:55:08,348 --> 00:55:10,350
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

597
00:55:13,645 --> 00:55:17,274
What's all this stuff?
Straws and flowers.

598
00:55:17,357 --> 00:55:18,609
I don't know.

599
00:55:19,276 --> 00:55:20,444
<i>And there they go!</i>

600
00:55:20,527 --> 00:55:22,029
<i>And it's Allstar Seaworthy...</i>

601
00:55:22,112 --> 00:55:23,447
Eric!

602
00:55:27,367 --> 00:55:29,244
He doesn't look so good.

603
00:55:30,996 --> 00:55:32,372
Get that drink.

604
00:55:34,458 --> 00:55:35,918
What's the matter with him?

605
00:55:36,501 --> 00:55:37,836
I don't know.

606
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:40,047
Here, you want some?

607
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:45,510
He looks depressed or something.

608
00:55:48,597 --> 00:55:50,098
You have a family?

609
00:55:52,184 --> 00:55:53,644
Oh, my gosh, there's three of them.

610
00:55:53,727 --> 00:55:56,229
- Three?
- Ask him where he came from.

611
00:55:56,605 --> 00:55:58,357
How am I gonna do that?

612
00:55:59,024 --> 00:56:00,400
Wait a second.

613
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:05,113
Your family here?

614
00:56:07,282 --> 00:56:09,368
He's pointing to my school.

615
00:56:10,535 --> 00:56:13,538
Oh, my gosh, that's my mom!
What are we going to do?

616
00:56:13,872 --> 00:56:15,540
You'll have to go without me.

617
00:56:15,707 --> 00:56:18,627
She won't do that. She's supposed
to be looking after you.

618
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:20,462
We can't leave him here like this.

619
00:56:20,545 --> 00:56:22,339
You have to go, Eric.

620
00:56:22,589 --> 00:56:24,174
Tell her I'll be there in a minute.

621
00:56:24,383 --> 00:56:27,219
- What are you going to do?
- Just go and tell her.

622
00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:29,680
Okay.

623
00:56:30,097 --> 00:56:31,974
Bye! I'll see you later!

624
00:56:35,644 --> 00:56:37,479
It's not safe here anymore.

625
00:56:37,646 --> 00:56:39,314
You have to come with me.

626
00:56:39,439 --> 00:56:40,524
Please.

627
00:56:40,774 --> 00:56:42,943
I won't let anybody hurt you.

628
00:57:10,679 --> 00:57:12,389
What is he doing in there?

629
00:57:13,056 --> 00:57:14,348
I think he was changing
steering wheels...

630
00:57:14,349 --> 00:57:16,101
...on his wheelchair.

631
00:57:16,768 --> 00:57:19,771
Debbie, wheelchairs
don't have a steering wheel.

632
00:57:21,356 --> 00:57:23,233
Maybe it was a flat tire.

633
00:57:24,151 --> 00:57:25,861
Maybe I'd better go help him.

634
00:57:25,986 --> 00:57:27,070
I'll do it.

635
00:57:28,322 --> 00:57:30,240
Oh, no!

636
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,911
Kinda old for a teddy, isn't he?

637
00:57:35,662 --> 00:57:37,289
He's from Illinois.

638
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:40,959
Sorry it took so long.

639
00:57:41,001 --> 00:57:43,003
That's okay.
So, how do we do this?

640
00:57:43,086 --> 00:57:45,589
My wheelchair can fit in back,
and I'll sit in front.

641
00:57:45,714 --> 00:57:46,924
Sounds good.

642
00:57:47,633 --> 00:57:49,676
Here, take him. Go.

643
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:54,765
All right, here we go.

644
00:58:00,145 --> 00:58:01,605
Sit down.

645
00:58:04,441 --> 00:58:05,817
Are you crazy?

646
00:58:05,901 --> 00:58:07,819
There's no way you're gonna
get away with this.

647
00:58:07,903 --> 00:58:10,906
I had to do something with him.
Keep him quiet.

648
00:58:15,911 --> 00:58:17,371
Sit still.

649
00:58:18,288 --> 00:58:19,790
Okay.

650
00:58:20,999 --> 00:58:23,335
Everybody fasten your seat belts.

651
00:58:24,419 --> 00:58:25,587
Let's go.

652
00:58:32,678 --> 00:58:35,555
- Well, what do you think?
- Follow them.

653
00:59:00,247 --> 00:59:03,875
This is J-3. We're traveling
east on Valley Vista.

654
00:59:04,376 --> 00:59:06,169
Tell them to stand by.

655
00:59:11,717 --> 00:59:12,968
Don't.

656
00:59:13,427 --> 00:59:15,637
So, Eric, how long
have you two been together?

657
00:59:16,805 --> 00:59:18,515
She means the teddy, Eric.

658
00:59:18,765 --> 00:59:20,517
Oh, a long time.

659
00:59:22,477 --> 00:59:24,771
- Keep still.
- Does your bear move?

660
00:59:25,397 --> 00:59:29,443
Oh, yeah. Uh, he's one of those
new computerized kind.

661
00:59:30,235 --> 00:59:32,112
But I thought you said
you had him a long time.

662
00:59:32,529 --> 00:59:35,282
I have.
He just got new microchips.

663
00:59:38,785 --> 00:59:39,911
Amazing.

664
01:00:37,678 --> 01:00:38,804
What's in here?

665
01:00:41,431 --> 01:00:43,684
Hi, Brittany! Happy birthday!

666
01:00:44,309 --> 01:00:45,477
Thank you.

667
01:00:45,727 --> 01:00:47,020
This is my friend Eric.

668
01:00:47,104 --> 01:00:48,480
- Hi, Eric.
- Hi.

669
01:00:49,606 --> 01:00:50,899
He's cute.

670
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:53,944
Hiya. How's it going?

671
01:00:54,027 --> 01:00:55,654
- It's going.
- Nice teddy bear.

672
01:00:57,281 --> 01:00:58,824
Hi, Eric, how ya feeling?

673
01:00:58,907 --> 01:01:00,117
Have you seen my brother yet?

674
01:01:00,284 --> 01:01:01,827
Uh, he'll be here soon.

675
01:01:08,125 --> 01:01:10,836
- No, Mac, give me that.
- Did you see that?

676
01:01:11,169 --> 01:01:15,465
- There's something in there.
- I don't believe it! Freaky!

677
01:01:16,174 --> 01:01:18,844
Look it, honey, we're leaving, okay?

678
01:01:18,927 --> 01:01:21,346
I'm gonna go, and I'll leave
Courtney here to watch you...

679
01:01:21,388 --> 01:01:22,931
...until Michael gets here, okay?

680
01:01:23,432 --> 01:01:26,435
Boy, that teddy is amazing!
I'll see you.

681
01:01:26,476 --> 01:01:27,519
Bye-bye.

682
01:01:31,189 --> 01:01:32,357
Happy birthday!

683
01:01:32,983 --> 01:01:35,694
Okay, kids, let's get
this dance contest going!

684
01:01:35,819 --> 01:01:36,987
- He's here!
- What?

685
01:01:37,279 --> 01:01:40,198
- Mac! He's in the teddy suit.
- He is? I don't believe this!

686
01:01:40,282 --> 01:01:42,492
- Let's dance!
- Debbie, what's going on?

687
01:01:42,701 --> 01:01:45,078
It's okay. Everybody thinks
he's just a toy!

688
01:01:46,872 --> 01:01:48,165
Hi, Michael.

689
01:01:48,290 --> 01:01:49,957
The thing I was telling you about
it's in the teddy suit.

690
01:01:49,958 --> 01:01:51,460
Oh, no way!
He's so cute!

691
01:01:51,543 --> 01:01:52,877
Yeah, real cute.
Listen, those guys...

692
01:01:52,878 --> 01:01:54,378
...who were following us, they're here.

693
01:01:54,379 --> 01:01:55,547
Well, what are we gonna do?

694
01:01:55,589 --> 01:01:57,006
I don't know.
Just keep him dancing...

695
01:01:57,007 --> 01:01:58,425
...they'll just think he's a teddy.

696
01:02:01,303 --> 01:02:04,723
<i>Concrete is jumping in the city</i>

697
01:02:05,182 --> 01:02:08,101
Okay, pick up the pace,
That's very good, Kathy,

698
01:02:11,188 --> 01:02:14,399
<i>They only lie to impress you</i>

699
01:02:16,151 --> 01:02:18,946
<i>And wait around for your defeat</i>

700
01:02:19,905 --> 01:02:22,741
<i>It's so hard to find someone</i>

701
01:02:22,908 --> 01:02:25,285
<i>Who really cares</i>

702
01:02:25,869 --> 01:02:28,997
<i>Gives you all that you need</i>

703
01:02:29,790 --> 01:02:35,087
<i>In the end is always there</i>

704
01:02:35,337 --> 01:02:39,758
<i>To give their heart right from the start</i>

705

<i>Down to earth</i>

01:03:08,912 --> 01:03:11,415
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

712
01:03:12,249 --> 01:03:14,668
This is Base-1.
Where are you guys? Move it!

713
01:03:15,377 --> 01:03:18,505
<i>You know that nothing comes for free</i>

714
01:03:25,971 --> 01:03:27,472
All right, come on, move it.
Let's go.

715
01:03:47,909 --> 01:03:52,706
<i>Clothes don't matter baby,

<i>What's inside that makes the man</i>

717
01:03:55,334 --> 01:03:57,127
Leave him alone!
He's not hurting anyone!

718
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:58,811
You don't know what you're getting into.

719
01:03:59,755 --> 01:04:01,547
- What's he done wrong?
- Come on, kid, back off.

720
01:04:01,548 --> 01:04:02,925
- Back off.
- What's he done wrong?

721
01:04:07,638 --> 01:04:08,931
Hold on, Mac.

722
01:04:09,932 --> 01:04:12,142
Get after them! Move it!

723
01:04:12,893 --> 01:04:14,102
Let's get the car.

724
01:04:14,144 --> 01:04:16,772
Get him before he
hits the street! Look out!

725
01:04:16,939 --> 01:04:18,190
Come on.

726
01:04:19,816 --> 01:04:20,859
All right, come on!

727
01:04:20,943 --> 01:04:23,236
- Come on!
- Oh, no!

728
01:04:28,992 --> 01:04:30,077
Come on.

729
01:04:38,585 --> 01:04:39,962
Come on, come on, come on!

730
01:04:40,045 --> 01:04:41,380
Go! Keep going!

731
01:04:51,682 --> 01:04:52,766
Come on!

732
01:04:52,933 --> 01:04:54,685
- Look out!
- Stay with him!

733
01:04:58,105 --> 01:04:59,273
Come on!

734
01:05:05,153 --> 01:05:06,488
Come on! Come on!

735
01:05:27,217 --> 01:05:28,385
Stay with him!

736
01:06:03,921 --> 01:06:05,380
He's in here!
Come on, come on!

737
01:06:06,423 --> 01:06:07,716
Let's go, let's go!

738
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:14,222
Check the aisles!

739
01:06:17,893 --> 01:06:19,102
There he is!

740
01:06:25,859 --> 01:06:27,861
- You okay?
- I'm okay. Go!

741
01:06:29,321 --> 01:06:30,739
Mom! Mom!

742
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,450
Mom!

743
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:34,951
How long have you been in lingerie?

744
01:06:34,952 --> 01:06:35,953
Mom!

745
01:06:36,954 --> 01:06:38,914
Excuse me, I'll be right back. Eric!

746
01:06:41,959 --> 01:06:43,418
Come on, guys, cool it!

747
01:06:43,502 --> 01:06:45,587
- What are you people doing?
- Stop that kid!

748
01:06:45,671 --> 01:06:48,090
Eric! What is that on your lap?

749
01:06:49,591 --> 01:06:51,009
Stop!

750
01:06:55,722 --> 01:06:57,975
The door's jammed!
The door's jammed!

751
01:06:58,058 --> 01:06:59,935
Get something! Get something!

752
01:07:06,316 --> 01:07:07,557
What do you think you're doing?

753
01:07:08,110 --> 01:07:09,111
Eric!

754
01:07:09,903 --> 01:07:11,655
This is not gonna work, Michael!

755
01:07:11,697 --> 01:07:14,533
- Just trust me.
- It's gonna work.

756
01:07:15,117 --> 01:07:16,159
Be careful.

757
01:07:16,243 --> 01:07:17,286
Eric!

758
01:07:17,744 --> 01:07:19,579
Don't hit him, Courtney!

759
01:07:20,455 --> 01:07:22,582
- Get him!
- Get ready!

760
01:07:22,708 --> 01:07:23,875
Stay with him.

761
01:07:24,459 --> 01:07:26,461
Michael! Eric!

762
01:07:26,587 --> 01:07:28,005
Come on, we've got you!

763
01:07:30,465 --> 01:07:32,217
- Now!
- You got him!

764
01:07:32,968 --> 01:07:34,136
All right!

765
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:38,765
Hey, those are my kids in there!

766
01:07:38,849 --> 01:07:42,311
Those kids? Those kids
just ran off with a...

767
01:07:44,563 --> 01:07:46,273
A little creature from outer space?

768
01:07:48,859 --> 01:07:50,193
No, Wickes.

769
01:07:50,485 --> 01:07:52,904
Well, no, Palmdale's fine.
I just need...

770
01:07:53,739 --> 01:07:54,906
That's fine, thank you.

771
01:07:55,657 --> 01:07:58,577
No, the address.
Wait, give me that again.

772
01:07:58,869 --> 01:08:00,037
Why don't you give it to him?

773
01:08:01,121 --> 01:08:02,205
Here, Mac.

774
01:08:02,289 --> 01:08:04,082
I don't think he's feeling too good.

775
01:08:04,291 --> 01:08:06,084
Something's happened to his family.

776
01:08:06,126 --> 01:08:08,253
He keeps on pointing
in the same direction.

777
01:08:08,503 --> 01:08:09,838
There's a Wickes in Palmdale.

778
01:08:09,922 --> 01:08:11,423
It's about 20 miles from the crash.

779
01:08:11,548 --> 01:08:14,051
- We have to go there.
- What do you think?

780
01:08:14,801 --> 01:08:16,052
I think we should call your mom.

781
01:08:16,053 --> 01:08:17,345
Look, she's not gonna understand.

782
01:08:17,346 --> 01:08:19,014
She's just gonna tell us to turn him in.

783
01:08:19,097 --> 01:08:20,349
Maybe that's what we should do.

784
01:08:20,432 --> 01:08:22,267
No, we have to help him.

785
01:08:22,351 --> 01:08:24,471
What if they have a good reason
for wanting him, Eric?

786
01:08:24,519 --> 01:08:27,040
What if he's dangerous? What if
he's got a disease or something?

787
01:08:27,189 --> 01:08:29,358
He doesn't have any diseases.

788
01:08:29,524 --> 01:08:31,902
I know no one's interested
what I have to say...

789
01:08:31,944 --> 01:08:34,196
...but I think he's
communicating with someone.

790
01:08:34,321 --> 01:08:35,739
It's his family.

791
01:08:36,490 --> 01:08:38,116
Don't you like him?

792
01:08:38,825 --> 01:08:40,494
Of course I do.

793
01:08:40,953 --> 01:08:42,496
I just don't want anyone to get hurt.

794
01:08:42,579 --> 01:08:44,038
Look, we're gonna get caught
sooner or later.

795
01:08:44,039 --> 01:08:45,749
I don't see what we've got to lose.

796
01:08:51,463 --> 01:08:52,547
We're gonna go.

797
01:08:53,131 --> 01:08:55,300
Come on. Let's do it.

798
01:08:55,384 --> 01:08:56,510
All right!

799
01:08:56,593 --> 01:08:57,636
Let's go, come on!

800
01:08:57,970 --> 01:08:59,263
All right!

801
01:09:31,670 --> 01:09:32,754
Thank you, my dear.

802
01:09:35,841 --> 01:09:37,551
Ooh, he likes this.

803
01:09:40,554 --> 01:09:42,055
Here, see if he likes this.

804
01:09:57,237 --> 01:09:59,072
Maybe they're just flowers.

805
01:10:00,532 --> 01:10:02,492
- How about a spaceship?
- Great!

806
01:10:02,618 --> 01:10:04,493
Yeah, and we'll have a close
encounter of the third kind.

807
01:10:04,494 --> 01:10:05,579
What's that?

808
01:10:05,662 --> 01:10:07,183
That's when you get to go on the ship.

809
01:10:07,831 --> 01:10:09,416
Here's another police car.

810
01:10:09,499 --> 01:10:10,626
Keep him down.

811
01:10:11,919 --> 01:10:13,086
We're fine.

812
01:10:19,885 --> 01:10:21,261
Hey, he's pointing at something.

813
01:10:21,970 --> 01:10:23,430
It's the horses.

814
01:10:23,555 --> 01:10:25,724
We've been passing horses
all the way here.

815
01:10:26,224 --> 01:10:27,267
Hey, did you see that?

816
01:10:30,228 --> 01:10:31,355
What?

817
01:10:33,982 --> 01:10:35,025
That's it!

818
01:10:35,192 --> 01:10:36,818
It's a sign, not a store.

819
01:10:37,819 --> 01:10:39,321
Looks like he wants to go down there.

820
01:10:39,488 --> 01:10:40,988
Maybe he's picking up
some sort of signal.

821
01:10:40,989 --> 01:10:42,074
Hold on.

822
01:10:42,157 --> 01:10:43,784
Maybe he lives around here.

823
01:10:46,453 --> 01:10:49,831
<i>I've got an ocean of love for you</i>

824
01:10:49,998 --> 01:10:52,334
<i>You and I are just a wave</i>

825
01:10:53,335 --> 01:10:57,005
<i>Love is in motion, wave</i>

826
01:11:02,803 --> 01:11:05,931
<i>'Cause I got an ocean of love for you</i>

827
01:11:09,184 --> 01:11:11,228
<i>Waves of motion</i>

828
01:11:17,109 --> 01:11:19,152
<i>Waves of motion</i>

829
01:11:26,952 --> 01:11:28,120
Hey, look!

830
01:11:28,704 --> 01:11:30,747
Windmills! That's what
he was trying to tell us.

831
01:11:30,831 --> 01:11:32,916
It's the straws! That's it!

832
01:11:33,041 --> 01:11:34,751
We must be getting closer!

833
01:11:35,294 --> 01:11:37,838
Bummer. I thought it was
gonna be a spaceship.

834
01:11:37,963 --> 01:11:40,340
You never know.
There still could be one.

835
01:12:35,354 --> 01:12:36,480
What's he doing?

836
01:12:37,481 --> 01:12:39,066
He's communicating.

837
01:13:07,219 --> 01:13:08,262
That's it.

838
01:13:20,732 --> 01:13:21,817
Let's go.

839
01:13:54,099 --> 01:13:55,517
You sure this is it, Mac?

840
01:13:59,688 --> 01:14:01,064
You guys better just wait here.

841
01:14:01,148 --> 01:14:02,691
Better give him the flashlight.

842
01:14:02,983 --> 01:14:04,344
Let's go, Mac.
Come on, on my back.

843
01:14:07,696 --> 01:14:08,739
Be careful.

844
01:14:11,491 --> 01:14:14,202
I know everybody's trying
to be optimistic,

845
01:14:14,453 --> 01:14:16,371
but what if they really are dangerous?

846
01:14:16,455 --> 01:14:18,624
- They're not dangerous.
- Michael!

847
01:14:19,666 --> 01:14:20,751
Are you sure it's okay?

848
01:14:20,834 --> 01:14:22,210
Yeah, just wait there.

849
01:15:33,407 --> 01:15:34,908
Get off, Mac. Come on.

850
01:16:01,435 --> 01:16:02,644
She's alive, Mac.

851
01:16:03,395 --> 01:16:05,188
We're gonna get some help.
Just stay here.

852
01:16:05,439 --> 01:16:06,690
She's alive.

853
01:16:12,613 --> 01:16:14,093
Give me some drinks, and the jackets.

854
01:16:14,156 --> 01:16:15,836
- What is it?
- There's three more of them.

855
01:16:15,907 --> 01:16:17,326
- Three?
- Are they friendly?

856
01:16:17,409 --> 01:16:18,492
Well, we'll find out soon enough.

857
01:16:18,493 --> 01:16:20,871
- There's only two cans left.
- That's fine, let's go.

858
01:16:21,830 --> 01:16:23,248
Come on, Eric.

859
01:16:26,043 --> 01:16:27,711
Be careful.
It's slippery there, guys.

860
01:16:28,670 --> 01:16:29,838
Hey, Mac.

861
01:16:35,093 --> 01:16:36,136
Give me a straw.

862
01:16:45,479 --> 01:16:46,605
That's it.

863
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:47,981
See, Mac?

864
01:16:48,523 --> 01:16:50,609
She's gonna be okay, Mac.

865
01:16:54,696 --> 01:16:55,948
It's okay.

866
01:16:56,114 --> 01:16:57,907
All right, see if you can
get the other one to drink...

867
01:16:57,908 --> 01:16:59,076
...the little one.

868
01:16:59,242 --> 01:17:00,369
Here.

869
01:17:16,843 --> 01:17:17,970
Good.

870
01:17:21,306 --> 01:17:23,267
Here, put, the jacket,
put the jacket on her.

871
01:17:25,269 --> 01:17:26,270
Okay.

872
01:17:29,898 --> 01:17:31,900
It's okay.
No one's gonna hurt you.

873
01:17:32,025 --> 01:17:34,361
Here's your baby.
He brought us to you.

874
01:17:35,070 --> 01:17:36,738
Easy, now. It's okay.

875
01:17:36,822 --> 01:17:39,366
- She must be Mac's sister.
- Must be.

876
01:17:43,203 --> 01:17:44,538
She's so gentle.

877
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,376
Easy. Easy.

878
01:17:53,797 --> 01:17:55,048
She won't hurt you.

879
01:17:55,465 --> 01:17:58,260
I'm Debbie. I live next door.

880
01:18:00,846 --> 01:18:02,598
This is my friend Eric.

881
01:18:09,855 --> 01:18:10,939
Hi.

882
01:18:21,950 --> 01:18:23,410
Here, give me the other jacket.

883
01:18:24,536 --> 01:18:25,912
Okay, just a minute.

884
01:18:46,350 --> 01:18:47,851
All right, put the jacket on.

885
01:18:49,645 --> 01:18:51,104
Give me that one, too, Debbie.

886
01:18:51,396 --> 01:18:55,150
Hey, hey, hey! Hey, come on!
Guys, give me another drink!

887
01:18:55,317 --> 01:18:56,568
We don't have any more.

888
01:18:56,985 --> 01:18:59,404
- Oh, shoot!
- We better get something soon!

889
01:19:00,405 --> 01:19:03,367
We're Mac's friends.
He brought us to meet you.

890
01:19:03,784 --> 01:19:05,327
No, friends,

891
01:19:56,670 --> 01:19:58,713
What if they need some kind of
medical attention or something?

892
01:19:58,714 --> 01:20:00,314
Look, we can't just
walk into a hospital.

893
01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:01,420
Everyone's gonna freak out.

894
01:20:01,425 --> 01:20:02,842
Well, it's just like you said,
people are gonna...

895
01:20:02,843 --> 01:20:04,303
...find out sooner or later.

896
01:20:04,553 --> 01:20:06,972
Oh, my gosh...

897
01:20:07,014 --> 01:20:08,223
What's he doing now?

898
01:20:08,307 --> 01:20:10,475
He just tied a knot in the tire iron!

899
01:20:10,559 --> 01:20:12,269
It's okay, I think he's just bored!

900
01:20:12,603 --> 01:20:14,938
Well, keep him busy!
Guys, keep him busy!

901
01:20:15,022 --> 01:20:17,816
- Here! Here, read him this!
- It's okay. He's got the hat.

902
01:20:17,858 --> 01:20:19,108
Look, maybe we should go public.

903
01:20:19,109 --> 01:20:20,192
If we can get 'em on
the news everyone...

904
01:20:20,193 --> 01:20:21,277
...is gonna want to help 'em.

905
01:20:21,278 --> 01:20:22,571
I'm not so sure about that.

906
01:20:22,654 --> 01:20:24,406
I think they'll be a big hit on TV.

907
01:20:24,448 --> 01:20:27,534
- What's he doing now?
- I think he wants my bracelet.

908
01:20:27,618 --> 01:20:29,410
- Well, then, give it to him!
- You're hurting me!

909
01:20:29,411 --> 01:20:30,662
- Michael!
- Well, do something!

910
01:20:30,746 --> 01:20:32,456
- What?
- I'm driving. I don't know.

911
01:20:32,706 --> 01:20:34,746
You can't do this when
we're in a vehicle like this.

912
01:20:34,750 --> 01:20:36,501
Now, you just cross
your arms and don't...

913
01:20:36,710 --> 01:20:38,879
...unloose them until I
tell you you can.

914
01:20:38,962 --> 01:20:40,088
Cross your arms.

915
01:20:40,213 --> 01:20:43,091
That's right. Just be the mommy,
be the mommy.

916
01:20:43,175 --> 01:20:44,301
That's right. You teach 'em.

917
01:20:44,509 --> 01:20:45,719
How much further is it?

918
01:20:45,761 --> 01:20:46,970
We should be there by now.

919
01:20:47,054 --> 01:20:48,931
He's starting to move again.

920
01:20:48,972 --> 01:20:50,474
What do you want me to do?

921
01:20:50,557 --> 01:20:53,143
- Simon says!
- Simon says, yeah.

922
01:20:53,226 --> 01:20:55,267
- Put your hands on your head.
- Hands on your head.

923
01:20:55,270 --> 01:20:57,022
- Your head.
- That's right, on your head.

924
01:20:57,522 --> 01:20:59,399
Head. Your head.

925
01:20:59,858 --> 01:21:01,485
All right, it's working, guys!

926
01:21:01,568 --> 01:21:03,695
- Okay, Simon says to...
- All right, great.

927
01:21:04,363 --> 01:21:06,073
Simon says... wiggle your ears.

928
01:21:06,156 --> 01:21:07,699
Wiggle your ears.
Wiggle your ears.

929
01:21:10,869 --> 01:21:12,579
All right, it's working!

930
01:21:13,538 --> 01:21:14,664
- Think of another one.
- Clap your hands.

931
01:21:14,665 --> 01:21:15,874
Simon says clap your hands.

932
01:21:15,958 --> 01:21:17,125
Clap your hands.

933
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:22,172
<i>Old MacDonald had a farm, e-i-e-i-o</i>

934
01:21:22,339 --> 01:21:26,718
<i>And on this farm he had a bird,
e-i-e-i-o</i>

935
01:21:30,347 --> 01:21:32,182
All right, just keep 'em singing,
all right?

936
01:21:33,517 --> 01:21:35,037
- All right, you got any money?
- Yeah.

937
01:21:35,227 --> 01:21:37,104
All right, pay for the
gas, get some drinks.

938
01:21:37,187 --> 01:21:39,105
- I'm gonna call my mom.
- What if they trace the call?

939
01:21:39,106 --> 01:21:40,439
We're not gonna be here that long.

940
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:41,900
- Just go do it.
- Okay.

941
01:21:48,156 --> 01:21:51,034
- Do you need anything?
- Yeah, get me some smokes.

942
01:22:12,514 --> 01:22:13,724
Don't do that!

943
01:22:15,892 --> 01:22:18,812
It's okay, they won't hurt you!
They won't hurt you!

944
01:22:19,938 --> 01:22:21,356
Well, when did she leave?

945
01:22:23,233 --> 01:22:24,901
Did she say where she was going?

946
01:22:25,944 --> 01:22:26,945
You better come quick.

947
01:22:27,029 --> 01:22:29,573
They got out of the van.
Everybodys freaking!

948
01:22:30,657 --> 01:22:32,367
Why didn't you
keep them singing, Debbie?

949
01:22:32,618 --> 01:22:34,745
Ma'am, I have to total
all the groceries first...

950
01:22:34,828 --> 01:22:36,149
...then I can deduct the coupons.

951
01:22:36,413 --> 01:22:37,831
What is that?

952
01:22:38,915 --> 01:22:40,000
Dad!

953
01:22:40,167 --> 01:22:42,628
It's all right, son. It's just
a promotional gag or something.

954
01:22:44,671 --> 01:22:47,299
Well, they're not advertising
clothes, that's for sure.

955
01:22:48,717 --> 01:22:50,469
Oh, I think they are real.

956
01:22:51,011 --> 01:22:52,596
Oh, they don't know what they're doing.

957
01:22:52,763 --> 01:22:53,847
We're getting out of here.

958

<i>Ernie, customer service
to register four.</i>

Do you believe this?

960
01:22:59,561 --> 01:23:01,563
That's it, man.
I'm going back on the soda.

961
01:23:04,274 --> 01:23:06,318
Hey! Hey, put that down!

962
01:23:07,861 --> 01:23:10,364
Hey! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

963
01:23:12,407 --> 01:23:14,409
I don't believe this.

964
01:23:19,873 --> 01:23:22,459
- Stay with Mommy.
- Security. Get security, quick!

965
01:23:22,834 --> 01:23:26,129
<i>Security to the front, please,

- I don't know.

967
01:23:28,632 --> 01:23:29,924
- Get 'em out of here.
- Don't hurt 'em.

968
01:23:29,925 --> 01:23:31,843
- They're not dangerous.
- They won't hurt you.

969
01:23:31,885 --> 01:23:33,966
All right, all right now you
put that down right now.

970
01:23:34,179 --> 01:23:35,389
They're not dangerous.

971
01:23:35,555 --> 01:23:37,641
Like hell it isn't.
Now, now, put it down.

972
01:23:37,766 --> 01:23:39,142
Look, they're not gonna hurt you.

973
01:23:40,227 --> 01:23:41,895
Look, I'll pay for the damage.

974
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:43,814
You stand back, now.
I'm warning you.

975
01:23:43,981 --> 01:23:45,357
No, they don't understand you.

976
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:46,775
He's telling the truth.

977
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:48,235
Tell him to back off!

978
01:23:48,402 --> 01:23:49,569
No!

979
01:23:53,073 --> 01:23:54,408
Give me the gun!

980
01:23:55,242 --> 01:23:56,450
Get out of here! Get out of here!

981
01:23:56,451 --> 01:23:58,370
- I'm not leaving!
- Go!

982
01:24:02,332 --> 01:24:03,834
- Give me the gun.
- Step back!

983
01:24:04,209 --> 01:24:05,377
Move away from it!

984
01:24:05,669 --> 01:24:08,130
- Step away from it!
- They're not gonna hurt you!

985
01:24:08,213 --> 01:24:10,340
- Move it, now!
- Michael, please!

986
01:24:10,424 --> 01:24:13,760
Come on. You don't understand!
They're not gonna hurt anyone!

987
01:24:14,261 --> 01:24:15,554
Give me the gun!

988
01:24:16,638 --> 01:24:18,181
Come on! Don't shoot 'em!

989
01:24:18,473 --> 01:24:20,851
Come on, don't shoot 'em!
They're not gonna hurt you!

990
01:24:22,102 --> 01:24:23,269
I don't know where they came from.

991
01:24:23,270 --> 01:24:24,313
We found them in a cave.

992
01:24:24,438 --> 01:24:25,980
Just get over to the car.
Come on, move!

993
01:24:25,981 --> 01:24:27,982
- They're not dangerous!
- Just get 'em down here...

994
01:24:27,983 --> 01:24:29,067
...right away!

995
01:24:29,151 --> 01:24:31,528
No! Leave 'em alone!
They're not gonna hurt anyone!

996
01:24:31,570 --> 01:24:32,863
Hold your fire, everybody!

997
01:24:32,946 --> 01:24:34,823
- Hold your fire!
- It's still got a gun.

998
01:24:35,073 --> 01:24:36,992
Just do as I tell you.
Hold your fire.

999
01:24:37,159 --> 01:24:38,744
<i>This is the police.</i>

1000
01:24:38,827 --> 01:24:41,246
<i>Put down your gun,
and nothing will happen to you.</i>

1001
01:24:41,330 --> 01:24:45,250
<i>I repeat, put down your gun,
and nothing will happen to you.</i>

1002
01:24:45,334 --> 01:24:46,376
He doesn't understand you.

1003
01:24:46,460 --> 01:24:49,087
Get back, get back, get back.

1004
01:24:52,382 --> 01:24:54,676
Get those people out of here.
Get those people back.

1005
01:24:55,052 --> 01:24:56,094
Move it!

1006
01:24:56,219 --> 01:24:58,555
- Get those people out of here!
- Evacuate that building!

1007
01:24:58,639 --> 01:25:00,097
Get those people out of that building!

1008
01:25:00,098 --> 01:25:01,350
Can you tell them to stop?

1009
01:25:01,433 --> 01:25:03,143
I told you, they don't understand.

1010
01:25:03,977 --> 01:25:05,228
Clear this building now!

1011
01:25:05,729 --> 01:25:08,690
I can stop them!
Let me go out there, please!

1012
01:25:08,815 --> 01:25:11,234
I can't let you do that, son.
He's got a gun.

1013
01:25:13,278 --> 01:25:14,404
We're gonna lose 'em, Bill!

1014
01:25:14,488 --> 01:25:16,323
They don't know how to drive, anyway!

1015
01:25:16,740 --> 01:25:18,742
- Stop him!
- Eric!

1016
01:25:23,705 --> 01:25:24,998
No!

1017
01:25:38,762 --> 01:25:39,972
Eric!

1018
01:25:40,389 --> 01:25:41,807
Get a doctor!

1019
01:25:52,234 --> 01:25:53,944
Hey! Eric!

1020
01:25:54,987 --> 01:25:56,780
- Eric!
- Let me get him on the ground.

1021
01:25:57,155 --> 01:25:58,865
Eric, talk to me, please!

1022
01:25:59,658 --> 01:26:01,910
Eric! Eric, talk to me!

1023
01:26:01,994 --> 01:26:03,495
Talk to me, Eric.
Come on.

1024
01:26:03,578 --> 01:26:05,122
I know he's still breathing.

1025
01:26:06,832 --> 01:26:08,584
- Eric!
- He's gonna be okay.

1026
01:26:09,751 --> 01:26:11,628
Get back, I'm a doctor.
Get back.

1027
01:26:13,672 --> 01:26:14,923
Oh, my God!

1028
01:26:15,173 --> 01:26:18,552
Eric! Come on, Eric, talk to me, please!

1029
01:26:19,678 --> 01:26:20,887
- Eric.
- What is it?

1030
01:26:20,971 --> 01:26:22,723
Eric, everything's gonna be okay.

1031
01:26:23,849 --> 01:26:25,183
- He's gone.
- What?

1032
01:26:25,517 --> 01:26:26,518
What?

1033
01:26:27,227 --> 01:26:28,603
- He's gone?
- There's nothing I can do.

1034
01:26:28,604 --> 01:26:30,105
- I'm sorry.
- Eric!

1035
01:26:30,897 --> 01:26:32,316
Oh, my God!

1036
01:26:32,441 --> 01:26:33,817
Eric.

1037
01:26:34,568 --> 01:26:35,694
He can't be!

1038
01:26:35,777 --> 01:26:37,779
My God, Eric!

1039
01:27:00,093 --> 01:27:02,679
- We've got a problem.
- What is it?

1040
01:27:02,763 --> 01:27:04,765
- Little boy's been hurt.
- Which little boy?

1041
01:27:04,848 --> 01:27:06,729
I don't know his name,
but he's in a wheelchair!

1042
01:27:06,850 --> 01:27:08,310
- Where is he?
- He's over here.

1043
01:27:08,393 --> 01:27:11,021
- Wickett, secure the area.
- Take that area over there.

1044
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:12,689
He's ten years old!

1045
01:27:13,148 --> 01:27:15,317
All you people move back!

1046
01:27:17,569 --> 01:27:18,904
Let me in. I'm his mother.

1047
01:27:21,573 --> 01:27:23,659
They can't help him! They can't!

1048
01:27:30,540 --> 01:27:32,334
We tried to stop him.

1049
01:27:33,877 --> 01:27:34,878
Eric.

1050
01:27:34,962 --> 01:27:36,713
Oh, my baby.

1051
01:27:45,430 --> 01:27:46,932
My baby!

1052
01:28:36,231 --> 01:28:39,359
They won't hurt you, Mom.
They won't hurt you.

1053
01:28:46,408 --> 01:28:47,868
They're not gonna hurt him, Mom.

1054
01:28:49,036 --> 01:28:50,704
Just trust 'em, all right?

1055
01:31:07,341 --> 01:31:08,425
Eric.

1056
01:31:12,262 --> 01:31:13,263
Eric?

1057
01:31:16,183 --> 01:31:17,392
You okay?

1058
01:31:18,602 --> 01:31:19,895
He's okay!

1059
01:31:21,271 --> 01:31:22,564
Eric.

1060
01:31:32,032 --> 01:31:33,867
Mom? Mom?

1061
01:31:49,758 --> 01:31:51,801
Okay, the house. Is everything
arranged in the house?

1062
01:31:51,802 --> 01:31:53,010
Everything's been taken care of.

1063
01:31:53,011 --> 01:31:54,692
- What about the car? The car?
- It's fine!

1064
01:31:55,097 --> 01:31:56,257
Headroom-what about headroom?

1065
01:31:56,265 --> 01:31:57,473
It's perfect. There's
plenty of headroom!

1066
01:31:57,474 --> 01:31:59,017
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive!

1067
01:31:59,101 --> 01:32:01,311
- Let's go! We can't be late!
- I'm coming!

1068
01:32:08,652 --> 01:32:11,655
<i>All rise.
Please raise your right hand.</i>

1069
01:32:14,283 --> 01:32:16,326
<i>I hereby declare on oath...</i>

1091
01:33:27,147 --> 01:33:28,357
I do.

1092
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:30,943
<i>Now, may I extend a warm congratulation.</i>

1093
01:33:31,443 --> 01:33:35,530
<i>You are now citizens
of the United States of America.</i>

1094
01:33:47,251 --> 01:33:52,923
<i>When you know who you are</i>

1095
01:33:54,258 --> 01:33:59,554

<i>You're not a stranger anymore</i>

1097
01:34:12,109 --> 01:34:17,030
<i>Sometimes it's not so clear</i>

1098
01:34:17,656 --> 01:34:22,452
<i>You're out there all alone</i>

1099
01:34:22,703 --> 01:34:30,502
<i>You're not a stranger anymore</i>

1100

<i>The day dream we both see</i>

1102
01:34:44,266 --> 01:34:51,356
<i>Reach for that star no matter
where you are it will be</i>

1103
01:34:52,107 --> 01:34:57,195
<i>Just believe in you and me</i>

1104
01:34:58,530 --> 01:35:03,910
<i>You're near the rainbow's end</i>

1105
01:35:03,994 --> 01:35:08,707
<i>So let the whole world know</i>

1106
01:35:09,207 --> 01:35:17,215
<i>You're not a stranger anymore</i>

1107
01:35:40,656 --> 01:35:46,453
<i>And here with the heart
we're not two worlds apart</i>

1112
01:36:12,396 --> 01:36:17,109
<i>When you know you belong</i>

1113
01:36:17,609 --> 01:36:21,655
<i>It's written on your face</i>

1114
01:36:22,072 --> 01:36:28,120
<i>And now you found that special place</i>

1115
01:36:28,996 --> 01:36:40,465
<i>You're not a stranger anymore</i>

1116
01:37:30,807 --> 01:37:35,646
<i>Tired of feeling all by myself</i>

1117
01:37:36,939 --> 01:37:41,526
<i>Being so different from everyone else</i>

1118
01:37:42,945 --> 01:37:47,658
<i>Somehow you knew I needed your help</i>

1119
01:37:49,743 --> 01:37:54,581
<i>Be my friend forever</i>

1120
01:37:56,625 --> 01:38:01,380
<i>I never found my star in the night</i>

1121
01:38:02,547 --> 01:38:07,427
<i>Living my dreams were far from my sight</i>

1122
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:13,517
<i>You came along and I saw the light</i>

1123
01:38:15,519 --> 01:38:19,856
<i>We'll be friends forever</i>

1124
01:38:21,817 --> 01:38:26,780
<i>I can't face the thought of you leaving</i>

1125
01:38:27,823 --> 01:38:30,492
<i>So take me along</i>

1126
01:38:31,034 --> 01:38:36,498
<i>I shall be strong when you take me</i>

1127
01:38:36,873 --> 01:38:39,418
<i>Wherever you go</i>

1128
01:38:40,335 --> 01:38:45,382
<i>I will learn the things that you know</i>

1129
01:38:46,508 --> 01:38:50,053
<i>Now that you made me believe</i>

1130
01:38:50,596 --> 01:38:54,558
<i>I hope you take me</i>

1131
01:38:55,183 --> 01:38:57,769
<i>But I know what you need</i>

1132
01:38:58,562 --> 01:39:03,609
<i>Able to see the things that you see</i>

1133
01:39:04,693 --> 01:39:08,363
<i>So that what ever you do</i>
