1
00:02:48,387 --> 00:02:52,221
If you wish to make
an apple pie from scratch...

2
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:56,887
...you must first invent the universe.

3
00:02:57,096 --> 00:02:58,688
Thank you very much.

4
00:02:59,865 --> 00:03:02,299
Suppose I cut a piece...

5
00:03:03,168 --> 00:03:05,102
...out of this apple pie.

6
00:03:17,783 --> 00:03:20,251
Crumbly, but good.

7
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:28,526
And now suppose we cut
this piece in half, or more or less.

8
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:32,996
And then cut this piece in half...

9
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,760
...and keep going.

10
00:03:35,968 --> 00:03:40,632
How many cuts before we get
down to an individual atom?

11
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:45,538
The answer is about
90 successive cuts.

12
00:03:46,645 --> 00:03:49,978
Of course, this knife isn't
sharp enough...

13
00:03:50,182 --> 00:03:52,650
...the pie is too crumbly...

14
00:03:52,851 --> 00:03:56,252
...and an atom is too small
to see in any case.

15
00:03:56,455 --> 00:03:59,891
But there is a way to do it.

16
00:04:02,528 --> 00:04:06,760
It was here at
Cambridge University in England...

17
00:04:06,965 --> 00:04:10,264
...that the nature of the atom was
first understood...

18
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:14,838
...in part by shooting pieces
of atoms at atoms...

19
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,203
...and seeing how they bounce off.

20
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,937
A typical atom is surrounded...

21
00:04:22,147 --> 00:04:25,913
...by a kind of cloud of electrons.

22
00:04:26,118 --> 00:04:30,054
The electrons are electrically
charged, as the name suggests...

23
00:04:30,255 --> 00:04:33,622
...and they determine the chemical
properties of the atom.

24
00:04:33,826 --> 00:04:37,887
For example, the glitter of gold...

25
00:04:40,866 --> 00:04:42,800
...or the transparency of the solid...

26
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:46,027
...that's made from the atoms
silicon and oxygen.

27
00:04:47,306 --> 00:04:49,536
But deep inside the atom...

28
00:04:49,741 --> 00:04:53,802
...hidden far beneath
the outer electron cloud...

29
00:04:54,012 --> 00:04:58,039
...is the nucleus, composed chiefly
of protons and neutrons.

30
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,616
Atoms are very small.

31
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:05,381
100 million of them, end to end,
would be about so big.

32
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:10,494
And the nucleus is 100,000 times
smaller still.

33
00:05:10,996 --> 00:05:14,727
Nevertheless, most of the mass
in an atom is in the nucleus.

34
00:05:14,933 --> 00:05:17,993
The electrons are by comparison...

35
00:05:18,203 --> 00:05:21,172
...just bits of moving fluff.

36
00:05:21,373 --> 00:05:24,536
Atoms are mainly empty space.

37
00:05:24,743 --> 00:05:28,804
Matter is composed chiefly
of nothing.

38
00:05:31,717 --> 00:05:34,845
When we consider cutting this
apple pie, but...

39
00:05:35,053 --> 00:05:38,489
...down beyond a single atom...

40
00:05:38,757 --> 00:05:43,592
...we confront an infinity
of the very small.

41
00:05:43,795 --> 00:05:46,764
And when we look up
at the night sky...

42
00:05:46,965 --> 00:05:50,958
...we confront an infinity
of the very large.

43
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:55,869
These infinities are among the most
awesome of human ideas.

44
00:05:56,074 --> 00:06:00,511
They represent an unending regress
which goes on...

45
00:06:00,913 --> 00:06:05,043
...not just very far, but forever.

46
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,118
Have you ever stood between two
parallel mirrors...

47
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:10,720
...in a barbershop, say...

48
00:06:10,923 --> 00:06:14,415
...and seen a very large
number of you?

49
00:06:14,626 --> 00:06:17,561
Or you could use...

50
00:06:18,797 --> 00:06:21,265
...two flat mirrors...

51
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,100
...and a candle flame...

52
00:06:24,303 --> 00:06:27,602
...you would see a large number
of images...

53
00:06:27,806 --> 00:06:31,606
...each the reflection
of another image.

54
00:06:33,512 --> 00:06:36,743
You can't really see an infinity
of images...

55
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:40,282
...because the mirrors aren't
perfectly flat and aligned.

56
00:06:40,485 --> 00:06:43,886
And there's a candle or
a candle flame in the way...

57
00:06:44,089 --> 00:06:46,819
...and light doesn't travel
infinitely fast.

58
00:06:47,025 --> 00:06:49,459
When we talk of real infinities...

59
00:06:49,661 --> 00:06:53,529
...we're talking about a quantity
larger than any number.

60
00:06:53,732 --> 00:06:58,192
No matter what number you have in
mind, infinity is larger.

61
00:07:01,907 --> 00:07:06,207
There's a nice way
to write large numbers.

62
00:07:06,411 --> 00:07:07,810
You can...

63
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,314
...write the number 1000...

64
00:07:11,516 --> 00:07:14,110
...as 10 to the power three...

65
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,255
...meaning, a one
followed by three zeros.

66
00:07:18,457 --> 00:07:23,394
Or a million is written as
10 to the power six...

67
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:28,496
...meaning, a one
followed by six zeros.

68
00:07:29,234 --> 00:07:33,364
There's no largest number. If anybody
gives you a candidate...

69
00:07:33,572 --> 00:07:35,563
...you can always add the
number one to it.

70
00:07:35,774 --> 00:07:38,709
But there certainly are
very big numbers.

71
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:43,609
The American mathematician Edward
Kasner once asked his nephew...

72
00:07:43,815 --> 00:07:47,216
...to invent a name for
an extremely large number:

73
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,013
10 to the power 100...

74
00:07:51,223 --> 00:07:56,160
...which I can't write out all the
zeros because there isn't room.

75
00:07:56,361 --> 00:08:01,128
The boy called it a googol.

76
00:08:02,834 --> 00:08:07,635
If you think a googol is large,
consider a googolplex.

77
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,900
It's 10 to the power of a googol.

78
00:08:11,109 --> 00:08:14,567
That is, a one followed, not by
100 zeros...

79
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,943
...but by a googol zeros.

80
00:08:19,017 --> 00:08:20,780
Now, by comparison...

81
00:08:20,986 --> 00:08:23,648
...with these enormous numbers...

82
00:08:23,855 --> 00:08:27,052
...the total number of atoms
in that apple pie...

83
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:30,228
...is only about 10 to the 26th.

84
00:08:30,429 --> 00:08:33,296
Tiny compared to a googol and...

85
00:08:33,498 --> 00:08:37,059
...of course, much, much less
than a googolplex.

86
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:38,861
The number
of elementary particles...

87
00:08:39,071 --> 00:08:41,039
...protons, neutrons and electrons...

88
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:42,934
...in the accessible universe...

89
00:08:43,141 --> 00:08:45,439
...is of the order of 10 to the 80th.

90
00:08:45,644 --> 00:08:47,669
A one followed by 80 zeros.

91
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:49,938
Still much, much less than a googol...

92
00:08:50,148 --> 00:08:53,743
...and vastly less than a googolplex.

93
00:08:53,952 --> 00:08:58,719
And yet, these numbers, the googol
and the googolplex...

94
00:08:58,924 --> 00:09:03,657
...do not approach, they come
nowhere near infinity.

95
00:09:03,862 --> 00:09:08,697
In fact, a googolplex is precisely
as far from infinity...

96
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,767
...as is the number one.

97
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,201
We started to write out
a googolplex...

98
00:09:15,407 --> 00:09:17,204
...but it wasn't easy.

99
00:09:19,044 --> 00:09:21,672
SAGAN:
It's a very big number.

100
00:09:41,032 --> 00:09:45,332
Writing out a googolplex is a
spectacularly futile exercise.

101
00:09:45,937 --> 00:09:49,964
A piece of paper large enough to
contain the zeros in a googolplex...

102
00:09:50,175 --> 00:09:54,373
...couldn't be stuffed into
the known universe.

103
00:10:00,085 --> 00:10:01,052
Fortunately...

104
00:10:02,587 --> 00:10:04,054
...there's a...

105
00:10:05,357 --> 00:10:07,689
...much simpler
and more concise way...

106
00:10:07,893 --> 00:10:09,986
...to write a googolplex.

107
00:10:18,236 --> 00:10:19,635
Like this.

108
00:10:19,838 --> 00:10:21,829
And infinity...

109
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:27,444
...can be represented like this.

110
00:10:28,013 --> 00:10:31,915
This is the Cavendish Laboratory
at Cambridge University...

111
00:10:32,117 --> 00:10:36,076
...where the constituents of the atom
were first discovered.

112
00:10:36,288 --> 00:10:40,247
The realm of the very small.

113
00:10:41,526 --> 00:10:45,553
From the time of Democritus,
in the fifth century B.C...

114
00:10:45,764 --> 00:10:49,495
...people have speculated
about the existence of atoms.

115
00:10:49,701 --> 00:10:53,068
For the last few hundred years,
there have been persuasive...

116
00:10:53,271 --> 00:10:56,832
...but indirect arguments that all
matter is made of atoms.

117
00:10:57,075 --> 00:11:01,671
But only in our time, have we actually
been able to see them.

118
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:06,476
Here the red blobs are the random
throbbing motions...

119
00:11:06,952 --> 00:11:08,442
...of uranium atoms...

120
00:11:08,653 --> 00:11:11,645
...magnified 100 million times.

121
00:11:12,924 --> 00:11:17,452
How Democritus of Abdera
would've enjoyed this movie.

122
00:11:22,467 --> 00:11:27,234
We pretty much take atoms for granted.

123
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:31,031
And yet, there are so
many different kinds...

124
00:11:31,243 --> 00:11:35,646
...lovely and useful at
the same time.

125
00:11:35,847 --> 00:11:36,973
Look.

126
00:12:04,276 --> 00:12:08,303
There are some 92 chemically
distinct kinds of atoms...

127
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,611
...naturally found on Earth.

128
00:12:10,815 --> 00:12:14,581
They're called the chemical elements.

129
00:12:30,135 --> 00:12:32,660
Virtually everything
we see and know...

130
00:12:32,871 --> 00:12:35,271
...all the beauty
of the natural world...

131
00:12:35,473 --> 00:12:38,965
...is made of these
few kinds of atoms...

132
00:12:39,177 --> 00:12:43,546
...arranged in harmonious
chemical patterns.

133
00:12:59,965 --> 00:13:03,662
Here we've represented
all 92 of them.

134
00:13:03,868 --> 00:13:08,202
At room temperature, many of
them are solids.

135
00:13:08,406 --> 00:13:10,101
A few are gases.

136
00:13:10,442 --> 00:13:11,773
And two of them...

137
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:16,104
...bromine and mercury,
are liquids.

138
00:13:17,782 --> 00:13:21,548
They're arranged in order
of complexity.

139
00:13:21,753 --> 00:13:25,587
Hydrogen, the simplest element,
is element number 1.

140
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:28,953
And uranium, the most complex...

141
00:13:29,394 --> 00:13:31,794
...is element 92.

142
00:13:35,133 --> 00:13:37,966
Some elements are very familiar.

143
00:13:38,637 --> 00:13:39,865
For example...

144
00:13:40,071 --> 00:13:44,167
...silicon, oxygen, magnesium,
aluminum, iron...

145
00:13:44,376 --> 00:13:45,900
...those that make up the Earth.

146
00:13:46,177 --> 00:13:50,671
Or hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen,
oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur...

147
00:13:50,882 --> 00:13:53,373
...the elements that are
essential for life.

148
00:13:53,585 --> 00:13:57,544
Other elements are
spectacularly unfamiliar.

149
00:13:57,756 --> 00:14:00,725
For example, hafnium.

150
00:14:01,326 --> 00:14:02,725
Erbium.

151
00:14:02,927 --> 00:14:04,827
Dysprosium.

152
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,728
Praseodymium.

153
00:14:07,932 --> 00:14:10,833
Elements we don't bump
into in everyday life.

154
00:14:11,636 --> 00:14:16,573
By and large, the more familiar an
element is, the more abundant it is.

155
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:19,207
There's a great deal of iron
on the Earth.

156
00:14:19,411 --> 00:14:23,006
Not all that much yttrium.

157
00:14:23,214 --> 00:14:24,442
The fact...

158
00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:28,244
...that atoms are composed of only
three kinds of elementary particles...

159
00:14:28,453 --> 00:14:30,921
...protons, neutrons and electrons...

160
00:14:31,122 --> 00:14:33,522
...is a comparatively recent finding.

161
00:14:33,725 --> 00:14:36,193
The neutron was not discovered
until 1932.

162
00:14:36,394 --> 00:14:40,854
And it, like the electron and
the proton, were discovered here...

163
00:14:41,066 --> 00:14:43,034
...at Cambridge University.

164
00:14:43,234 --> 00:14:47,330
Modern physics and chemistry
have reduced the complexity...

165
00:14:47,539 --> 00:14:52,101
...of the sensible world
to an astonishing simplicity.

166
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:56,542
Three units, put together
in different patterns...

167
00:14:56,748 --> 00:15:00,684
...make, essentially, everything.

168
00:15:06,124 --> 00:15:09,616
A neutron is electrically neutral...

169
00:15:09,828 --> 00:15:12,319
...as its name suggests.

170
00:15:12,897 --> 00:15:16,731
A proton has a positive
electrical charge...

171
00:15:17,302 --> 00:15:21,568
...and an electron an equal,
negative electrical charge.

172
00:15:21,773 --> 00:15:24,298
Since every atom is
electrically neutral...

173
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:26,739
...the number of protons
in the nucleus...

174
00:15:27,011 --> 00:15:31,072
...must equal the number of electrons
far away in the electron cloud.

175
00:15:31,282 --> 00:15:35,343
The protons and neutrons, together,
make up the nucleus of the atom.

176
00:15:36,421 --> 00:15:41,358
Now, the chemistry of an atom,
the nature of a chemical element...

177
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:43,789
...depends only on the number
of electrons...

178
00:15:43,995 --> 00:15:47,590
...which equals the number of protons,
which is called the atomic number.

179
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:50,097
Chemistry is just numbers.

180
00:15:50,301 --> 00:15:53,395
An idea which would have
appealed to Pythagoras.

181
00:15:53,605 --> 00:15:55,004
If you're an atom...

182
00:15:55,206 --> 00:15:58,403
...and you have just one proton...

183
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,077
...you're hydrogen.

184
00:16:00,278 --> 00:16:02,473
Two protons, helium.

185
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,511
Three, lithium.

186
00:16:04,716 --> 00:16:07,480
Four, beryllium.
Five protons, boron.

187
00:16:07,685 --> 00:16:12,247
Six, carbon, and seven, nitrogen.
Eight, oxygen, and so on.

188
00:16:12,457 --> 00:16:15,187
All the way to 92 protons...

189
00:16:15,393 --> 00:16:18,385
...in which case your name is uranium.

190
00:16:18,997 --> 00:16:22,125
Protons have positive
electrical charges...

191
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:25,530
...but like charges repel each other.

192
00:16:25,737 --> 00:16:28,137
So why does the nucleus hold together?

193
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:31,570
Why don't the electrical
repulsion of the protons...

194
00:16:31,776 --> 00:16:33,710
...make the nucleus fly to pieces?

195
00:16:34,312 --> 00:16:36,837
Because there's another
force in nature.

196
00:16:37,048 --> 00:16:39,608
Not electricity, not gravity...

197
00:16:39,818 --> 00:16:41,251
...the nuclear force.

198
00:16:41,452 --> 00:16:44,353
We can think of it as short-range...

199
00:16:44,556 --> 00:16:46,956
...hooks which start working...

200
00:16:47,158 --> 00:16:50,685
...when protons or neutrons
are brought very close together.

201
00:16:50,895 --> 00:16:53,386
The nuclear force can overcome...

202
00:16:54,132 --> 00:16:56,692
...the electrical repulsion of the
protons.

203
00:16:56,901 --> 00:16:59,961
Since the neutrons exert
nuclear forces...

204
00:17:00,471 --> 00:17:02,132
...but not electrical forces...

205
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:06,834
...they are a kind of glue which holds
the atomic nucleus together.

206
00:17:08,379 --> 00:17:12,907
A lump of two protons
and two neutrons...

207
00:17:13,117 --> 00:17:15,017
...is the nucleus of a helium atom...

208
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,688
...and is very stable.

209
00:17:17,889 --> 00:17:22,383
Three helium nuclei, stuck together by
nuclear forces...

210
00:17:22,594 --> 00:17:24,425
...makes carbon.

211
00:17:24,629 --> 00:17:28,030
Four helium nuclei makes oxygen.

212
00:17:28,233 --> 00:17:31,100
There's no difference between
four helium nuclei...

213
00:17:31,336 --> 00:17:33,896
...stuck together by nuclear forces
and the oxygen nucleus.

214
00:17:34,105 --> 00:17:35,595
They're the same thing.

215
00:17:35,974 --> 00:17:39,273
Five helium nuclei makes neon.

216
00:17:39,477 --> 00:17:41,877
Six makes magnesium.

217
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,743
Seven makes silicon.

218
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:48,510
Eight makes sulfur, and so on.

219
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,120
Increasing the atomic
numbers by two...

220
00:17:51,322 --> 00:17:54,189
...and always making
some familiar element.

221
00:17:54,392 --> 00:17:55,324
Every time...

222
00:17:56,294 --> 00:17:58,319
...we add or subtract one proton...

223
00:17:58,529 --> 00:18:01,225
...and enough neutrons
to keep the nucleus together...

224
00:18:01,432 --> 00:18:03,900
...we make a new chemical element.

225
00:18:04,102 --> 00:18:06,866
Consider mercury:

226
00:18:07,071 --> 00:18:10,837
If we subtract one proton
from mercury...

227
00:18:11,042 --> 00:18:15,240
...and three neutrons,
we convert it into gold.

228
00:18:15,446 --> 00:18:19,542
The dream of the ancient alchemists.

229
00:18:20,551 --> 00:18:24,419
Beyond element 92, beyond uranium...

230
00:18:24,622 --> 00:18:27,090
...there are other elements.

231
00:18:27,292 --> 00:18:29,453
They don't occur naturally
on the Earth.

232
00:18:29,661 --> 00:18:32,095
They're synthesized by
human beings and...

233
00:18:32,297 --> 00:18:34,925
...fall to pieces pretty rapidly.

234
00:18:35,133 --> 00:18:38,762
One of them, element 94,
is called plutonium...

235
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:42,701
...and is one of the most
toxic substances known.

236
00:18:42,907 --> 00:18:47,344
Where do the naturally occurring
chemical elements come from?

237
00:18:47,545 --> 00:18:51,982
Perhaps a separate creation
for each element?

238
00:18:52,183 --> 00:18:55,050
But all the elements are made of the
same elementary particles.

239
00:18:55,253 --> 00:18:58,245
The universe, all of it,
everywhere...

240
00:18:58,456 --> 00:19:01,857
...is 99.9% hydrogen and helium.

241
00:19:02,093 --> 00:19:03,958
The two simplest elements.

242
00:19:04,162 --> 00:19:05,356
In fact, helium...

243
00:19:05,797 --> 00:19:09,699
...was detected on the sun before it
was ever found on the Earth.

244
00:19:09,901 --> 00:19:13,701
Might the other chemical elements
have somehow...

245
00:19:13,905 --> 00:19:17,864
...evolved from hydrogen
and helium?

246
00:19:18,076 --> 00:19:20,442
To avoid the electrical repulsion...

247
00:19:21,145 --> 00:19:25,605
...protons and neutrons must be brought
very close together so the hooks...

248
00:19:25,817 --> 00:19:27,580
...which represent nuclear forces...

249
00:19:27,785 --> 00:19:29,150
...are engaged.

250
00:19:29,354 --> 00:19:32,482
This happens only at very high
temperatures, where particles...

251
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:37,354
...move so fast that there's no
time for electrical repulsion to act.

252
00:19:37,628 --> 00:19:42,565
Temperatures of tens of
millions of degrees.

253
00:19:42,834 --> 00:19:46,235
Such high temperatures are
common in nature.

254
00:19:46,437 --> 00:19:47,734
Where?

255
00:19:47,939 --> 00:19:50,874
In the insides of the stars.

256
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:10,056
Atoms are made in the
insides of stars.

257
00:20:10,261 --> 00:20:14,698
In most of the stars we see, hydrogen
nuclei are being jammed together...

258
00:20:14,899 --> 00:20:16,457
...to form helium nuclei.

259
00:20:16,868 --> 00:20:21,396
Every time a nucleus of helium is made,
a photon of light is generated.

260
00:20:22,373 --> 00:20:25,831
This is why the stars shine.

261
00:20:33,351 --> 00:20:37,344
Stars are born in great
clouds of gas and dust.

262
00:20:37,555 --> 00:20:41,286
Like the Orion Nebula,
1500 light-years away...

263
00:20:41,492 --> 00:20:45,485
...parts of which
are collapsing under gravity.

264
00:20:53,137 --> 00:20:57,540
Collisions among the atoms heat
the cloud until, in its interior...

265
00:20:57,742 --> 00:21:00,404
...hydrogen begins to fuse
into helium...

266
00:21:00,611 --> 00:21:03,409
...and the stars turn on.

267
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,216
Stars are born in batches.

268
00:21:12,423 --> 00:21:14,823
Later, they wander out
of their nursery...

269
00:21:15,026 --> 00:21:17,654
...to pursue their destiny
in the Milky Way.

270
00:21:17,862 --> 00:21:20,695
Adolescent stars, like the Pleiades...

271
00:21:20,898 --> 00:21:23,662
...are still surrounded
by gas and dust.

272
00:21:23,868 --> 00:21:28,328
Eventually, they journey
far from home.

273
00:21:32,143 --> 00:21:37,080
Somewhere there are stars formed from
the same cloud complex as the sun...

274
00:21:37,448 --> 00:21:39,609
...5 billion years ago.

275
00:21:39,817 --> 00:21:42,377
But we do not know which
stars they are.

276
00:21:42,587 --> 00:21:44,487
The siblings of the sun...

277
00:21:44,822 --> 00:21:49,555
...may, for all we know, be on the
other side of the galaxy.

278
00:21:51,162 --> 00:21:56,099
Perhaps they also warm nearby
planets as the sun does.

279
00:21:58,703 --> 00:22:01,604
Perhaps they too have presided...

280
00:22:01,806 --> 00:22:05,708
...over the evolution
of life and intelligence.

281
00:22:27,265 --> 00:22:31,998
The sun is the nearest star,
a glowing sphere of gas...

282
00:22:32,503 --> 00:22:36,530
...shining because of its heat,
like a red-hot poker.

283
00:22:40,878 --> 00:22:45,815
The surface we see in ordinary visible
light is at 6000 degrees centigrade.

284
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:47,847
But in its hidden interior...

285
00:22:48,586 --> 00:22:52,044
...in the nuclear furnace where
sunlight is ultimately generated...

286
00:22:52,256 --> 00:22:55,851
...its temperature is
20 million degrees.

287
00:23:04,235 --> 00:23:05,224
In x-rays...

288
00:23:05,436 --> 00:23:09,167
...we see a part of the sun
that is ordinarily invisible...

289
00:23:09,373 --> 00:23:12,001
...its million-degree halo of gas...

290
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:14,303
...the solar corona.

291
00:23:14,745 --> 00:23:17,839
In ordinary visible light, these
cooler, darker regions...

292
00:23:18,049 --> 00:23:19,949
...are the sunspots.

293
00:23:22,687 --> 00:23:27,147
They are associated with
great surges of flaming gas...

294
00:23:27,358 --> 00:23:31,727
...tongues of fire which would engulf
the Earth if it were this close.

295
00:23:32,063 --> 00:23:35,829
These prominences are guided
into paths determined...

296
00:23:36,033 --> 00:23:38,263
...by the sun's magnetic field.

297
00:23:50,915 --> 00:23:53,145
The dark regions of the x-ray sun...

298
00:23:53,351 --> 00:23:56,047
...are holes in the solar corona...

299
00:23:56,254 --> 00:24:00,247
...through which stream the protons
and electrons of the solar wind...

300
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:04,656
...on their way past the planets
to interstellar space.

301
00:24:07,164 --> 00:24:11,863
All this churning power is driven
by the sun's interior...

302
00:24:12,069 --> 00:24:15,971
...which is converting 400 million
tons of hydrogen into helium...

303
00:24:16,173 --> 00:24:17,697
...every second.

304
00:24:17,908 --> 00:24:21,503
The sun is a great fusion reactor...

305
00:24:21,746 --> 00:24:24,214
...into which a million Earths
would fit.

306
00:24:24,415 --> 00:24:27,543
Luckily for us, it's safely placed...

307
00:24:27,752 --> 00:24:31,279
...150 million kilometers away.

308
00:24:47,805 --> 00:24:51,707
It is the destiny of stars
to collapse.

309
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:56,211
Of the thousands of stars you see
when you look up at the night sky...

310
00:24:56,414 --> 00:25:01,044
...every one of them is living in
an interval between two collapses.

311
00:25:01,252 --> 00:25:02,742
An initial collapse of...

312
00:25:02,953 --> 00:25:06,445
...a dark interstellar gas cloud
to form the star...

313
00:25:06,657 --> 00:25:09,125
...and a final collapse
of the luminous star...

314
00:25:09,327 --> 00:25:11,090
...on the way to its ultimate fate.

315
00:25:11,562 --> 00:25:16,499
Gravity makes stars contract unless
some other force intervenes.

316
00:25:16,901 --> 00:25:19,802
The sun is an immense ball
of radiating hydrogen.

317
00:25:20,004 --> 00:25:24,304
The hot gas in its interior tries
to make the sun expand.

318
00:25:24,508 --> 00:25:27,909
The gravity tries to make
the sun contract.

319
00:25:28,145 --> 00:25:31,376
The present state of the sun is
the balance of these two forces...

320
00:25:31,582 --> 00:25:36,144
...an equilibrium between
gravity and nuclear fire.

321
00:25:36,821 --> 00:25:39,483
In this long middle age
between collapses...

322
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:42,386
...the stars steadily shine.

323
00:25:42,593 --> 00:25:46,427
But when the nuclear fuel is exhausted,
the interior cools...

324
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:49,428
...the pressure no longer supports
its outer layers...

325
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:51,794
...and the initial collapse resumes.

326
00:25:52,603 --> 00:25:54,901
There are three ways that stars die.

327
00:25:55,106 --> 00:25:57,540
Their fates are predestined.

328
00:25:57,742 --> 00:25:59,676
Everything depends on their
initial mass.

329
00:25:59,877 --> 00:26:02,471
A typical star with a mass
like the sun...

330
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,274
...will one day
continue its collapse...

331
00:26:05,483 --> 00:26:08,384
...until its density becomes very high.

332
00:26:08,586 --> 00:26:10,315
And then the contraction is stopped...

333
00:26:10,521 --> 00:26:12,386
...by the mutual repulsion of...

334
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:15,855
...the overcrowded electrons
in its interior.

335
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,824
A collapsing star twice as
massive as the sun...

336
00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:21,554
...isn't stopped by the
electron pressure.

337
00:26:21,766 --> 00:26:24,132
It goes on falling in on itself...

338
00:26:24,335 --> 00:26:27,031
...until nuclear forces
come into play...

339
00:26:27,238 --> 00:26:30,332
...and they hold up the
weight of the star.

340
00:26:30,541 --> 00:26:33,704
But a collapsing star three times as
massive as the sun isn't...

341
00:26:33,911 --> 00:26:35,970
...stopped even by nuclear forces.

342
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:41,117
There's no force known that can
withstand this enormous compression.

343
00:26:41,352 --> 00:26:44,412
And such a star has
an astonishing destiny.

344
00:26:44,622 --> 00:26:46,351
It continues to collapse...

345
00:26:46,624 --> 00:26:49,354
...until it vanishes utterly.

346
00:26:50,594 --> 00:26:55,054
Each star is described by the force
that holds it up against gravity.

347
00:26:55,266 --> 00:26:58,702
A star that's supported by
the gas pressure...

348
00:26:58,903 --> 00:27:02,600
...is a normal, run-of-the-mill star
like the sun.

349
00:27:02,807 --> 00:27:06,504
A collapsed star that's held up
by electron forces...

350
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,337
...is called a white dwarf.

351
00:27:08,546 --> 00:27:12,380
It's a sun shrunk to
the size of the Earth.

352
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:15,950
A collapsed star supported
by nuclear forces...

353
00:27:16,153 --> 00:27:18,018
...is called a neutron star.

354
00:27:18,222 --> 00:27:21,749
It's a sun shrunk to
the size of a city.

355
00:27:21,959 --> 00:27:24,894
And a star so massive that
in its final collapse...

356
00:27:25,095 --> 00:27:26,790
...it disappears altogether...

357
00:27:26,997 --> 00:27:28,658
...is called a black hole.

358
00:27:28,866 --> 00:27:31,858
It's a sun with no size at all.

359
00:27:32,536 --> 00:27:35,232
But on their ways to their
separate fates...

360
00:27:35,439 --> 00:27:40,103
...all stars experience
a premonition of death.

361
00:27:40,311 --> 00:27:42,779
Before the final
gravitational collapse...

362
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:47,815
...the star shudders and
briefly swells into some...

363
00:27:48,285 --> 00:27:50,719
...grotesque parody of itself.

364
00:27:50,921 --> 00:27:55,290
With its last gasp,
it becomes a red giant.

365
00:27:59,029 --> 00:28:01,520
Some 5 billion years from now...

366
00:28:01,732 --> 00:28:06,135
...there will be a last,
perfect day on Earth.

367
00:28:09,139 --> 00:28:12,666
Then, the sun will slowly change...

368
00:28:12,877 --> 00:28:15,903
...and the Earth will die.

369
00:28:19,049 --> 00:28:21,950
There is only so much
hydrogen fuel in the sun.

370
00:28:22,152 --> 00:28:24,552
When it's almost all
converted to helium...

371
00:28:24,755 --> 00:28:28,418
...the solar interior will continue
its original collapse.

372
00:28:28,626 --> 00:28:33,086
Higher temperatures in its core will
make the outside of the sun expand...

373
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:36,788
...and the Earth will
become slowly warmer.

374
00:28:37,034 --> 00:28:40,299
Eventually, life will be
extinguished...

375
00:28:40,671 --> 00:28:43,606
...the oceans will evaporate
and boil...

376
00:28:43,807 --> 00:28:47,834
...and our atmosphere will
gush away to space.

377
00:28:50,648 --> 00:28:54,448
The sun will become a bloated
red giant star...

378
00:28:54,652 --> 00:28:56,176
...filling the sky...

379
00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:00,584
...enveloping and devouring
the planets Mercury and Venus.

380
00:29:00,791 --> 00:29:03,851
And probably the Earth as well.

381
00:29:04,061 --> 00:29:08,998
The inner solar system will
reside inside the sun.

382
00:29:12,236 --> 00:29:15,103
But perhaps by then, our
descendants...

383
00:29:15,306 --> 00:29:17,866
...will have ventured somewhere else.

384
00:29:21,979 --> 00:29:26,382
In its final agonies, the sun
will slowly pulsate.

385
00:29:26,584 --> 00:29:29,485
By then, its core will have
become so hot...

386
00:29:29,687 --> 00:29:33,123
...that it temporarily converts
helium into carbon.

387
00:29:33,324 --> 00:29:37,226
The ash from today's nuclear fusion
will become the fuel...

388
00:29:37,528 --> 00:29:42,397
...to power the sun near the end of
its life in its red giant stage.

389
00:29:44,201 --> 00:29:47,034
Then the sun will lose
great shells...

390
00:29:47,571 --> 00:29:49,766
...of its outer atmosphere to space...

391
00:29:49,974 --> 00:29:53,375
...filling the solar system
with eerily glowing gas.

392
00:29:53,577 --> 00:29:56,637
The ghost of a star, outward bound.

393
00:29:56,847 --> 00:30:00,339
Perhaps half the mass of the sun
will be lost in this way.

394
00:30:02,286 --> 00:30:05,585
Viewed from elsewhere, our system
will then resemble...

395
00:30:05,789 --> 00:30:07,916
...the Ring Nebula in Lyra...

396
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:12,755
...the atmosphere of the sun
expanding outward like a soap bubble.

397
00:30:13,631 --> 00:30:16,862
And at the very center will be
a white dwarf.

398
00:30:17,101 --> 00:30:19,569
The hot exposed core of the sun...

399
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:23,331
...its nuclear fuel now
exhausted, slowly cooling...

400
00:30:23,574 --> 00:30:27,010
...to become a cold, dead star.

401
00:30:30,014 --> 00:30:32,642
Such is the life of an ordinary star.

402
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:36,047
Born in a gas cloud,
maturing as a yellow sun...

403
00:30:36,253 --> 00:30:38,084
...decaying as a red giant...

404
00:30:38,288 --> 00:30:43,225
...and dying as a white dwarf
enveloped in its shroud of gas.

405
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:55,363
Suppose, as we traveled through
interstellar space...

406
00:30:55,572 --> 00:30:57,403
...in our ship of the imagination...

407
00:30:57,608 --> 00:31:01,977
...we could sample the cold,
thin gas between the stars.

408
00:31:02,179 --> 00:31:05,171
We would find a great
preponderance of hydrogen...

409
00:31:05,382 --> 00:31:07,942
...an element as old as the universe.

410
00:31:08,152 --> 00:31:10,848
We would find carbon,
oxygen, silicon.

411
00:31:11,055 --> 00:31:14,149
The most abundant atoms in the
cosmos, apart from hydrogen...

412
00:31:14,358 --> 00:31:17,794
...are those most easily made
in the stars.

413
00:31:17,995 --> 00:31:21,396
But we would also find
a small proportion of rare elements.

414
00:31:21,598 --> 00:31:24,396
Praseodymium, say, or gold.

415
00:31:24,601 --> 00:31:26,762
They're not made in red giants.

416
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:31,600
Such elements are manufactured in
one of the most dramatic gestures...

417
00:31:31,842 --> 00:31:34,333
...of which a star is capable.

418
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:38,744
A star more than about one and
a half times the mass of the sun...

419
00:31:39,149 --> 00:31:40,776
...cannot become a white dwarf.

420
00:31:40,984 --> 00:31:43,953
It will end its life by
blowing itself up...

421
00:31:44,154 --> 00:31:48,614
...in a titanic stellar explosion
called a supernova.

422
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,823
There has been no supernova explosion
in our province of the galaxy...

423
00:31:54,198 --> 00:31:55,927
...since the telescope's invention...

424
00:31:56,133 --> 00:31:59,034
...and our sun will not
become a supernova.

425
00:31:59,236 --> 00:32:00,863
But in our imagination...

426
00:32:01,405 --> 00:32:04,704
...we can fulfill the dream of many
earthbound astronomers...

427
00:32:05,142 --> 00:32:09,875
...and safely witness, close-up,
a supernova explosion.

428
00:32:14,251 --> 00:32:18,153
Most of stellar evolution takes
millions or billions of years.

429
00:32:18,388 --> 00:32:21,915
But the interior collapse that
triggers a supernova explosion...

430
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:23,592
...takes only seconds.

431
00:32:23,961 --> 00:32:27,954
The star becomes brighter than
all the other stars in the galaxy...

432
00:32:28,165 --> 00:32:29,564
...put together.

433
00:33:05,269 --> 00:33:07,533
If a nearby star became
a supernova...

434
00:33:07,738 --> 00:33:12,471
...it would be calamity enough for
the inhabitants of this alien system.

435
00:33:12,676 --> 00:33:15,076
But if their own sun went supernova...

436
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:18,612
...it would be
an unprecedented catastrophe.

437
00:33:18,816 --> 00:33:21,250
Worlds would be charred and vaporized.

438
00:33:21,451 --> 00:33:25,911
Life, even on the outer planets,
would be extinguished.

439
00:33:26,123 --> 00:33:30,321
In our ship of the imagination, we
are now backing away from the star.

440
00:33:30,527 --> 00:33:32,188
But the explosion fragments...

441
00:33:32,396 --> 00:33:35,888
...traveling almost at the speed
of light, are overtaking us.

442
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:40,695
Individual atomic nuclei, accelerated
to high speeds in the explosion...

443
00:33:40,904 --> 00:33:42,838
...become cosmic rays.

444
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:47,306
This is another way that stars return
the atoms they've synthesized...

445
00:33:47,511 --> 00:33:49,376
...back into space.

446
00:33:50,147 --> 00:33:52,206
The shock wave
of expanding gases...

447
00:33:52,416 --> 00:33:54,941
...heats and compresses
the interstellar gas...

448
00:33:55,152 --> 00:33:58,144
...triggering a later generation
of stars to form.

449
00:33:58,355 --> 00:33:59,686
In this sense also...

450
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:04,293
...stars are phoenixes
rising from their own ashes.

451
00:34:09,132 --> 00:34:12,966
The cosmos was originally
all hydrogen and helium.

452
00:34:13,203 --> 00:34:16,570
Heavier elements were made
in red giants and in supernovas...

453
00:34:16,773 --> 00:34:18,764
...and then blown off to space...

454
00:34:18,976 --> 00:34:21,706
...where they were available
for subsequent generations...

455
00:34:21,912 --> 00:34:23,539
...of stars and planets.

456
00:34:23,747 --> 00:34:27,513
Our sun is probably a
third-generation star.

457
00:34:27,718 --> 00:34:29,345
Except for hydrogen and helium...

458
00:34:29,553 --> 00:34:34,490
...every atom in the sun and the Earth
was synthesized in other stars.

459
00:34:34,758 --> 00:34:39,286
The silicon in the rocks, the oxygen
in the air, the carbon in our DNA...

460
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:43,262
...the gold in our banks, the
uranium in our arsenals...

461
00:34:43,467 --> 00:34:47,062
...were all made thousands
of light-years away...

462
00:34:47,271 --> 00:34:49,136
...and billions of years ago.

463
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:53,673
Our planet, our society
and we ourselves...

464
00:34:53,877 --> 00:34:57,142
...are built of star stuff.

465
00:35:02,152 --> 00:35:05,121
We're in a lava tube.

466
00:35:05,889 --> 00:35:10,223
A cave carved through the Earth...

467
00:35:10,427 --> 00:35:12,987
...by a river of molten rock.

468
00:35:13,997 --> 00:35:16,056
To do a little experiment...

469
00:35:17,067 --> 00:35:20,468
...we've brought a Geiger counter...

470
00:35:23,507 --> 00:35:27,102
...and a piece of uranium ore.

471
00:35:27,844 --> 00:35:32,781
The Geiger counter is sensitive to
high-energy charged particles...

472
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:36,813
...protons, helium nuclei, gamma rays.

473
00:35:37,087 --> 00:35:40,488
If we bring it close
to the uranium ore...

474
00:35:40,691 --> 00:35:45,253
...the count rate, the number of
clicks, increases dramatically.

475
00:35:47,931 --> 00:35:50,229
We also have a lead canister here.

476
00:35:50,801 --> 00:35:53,361
And if I drop the uranium ore...

477
00:35:53,904 --> 00:35:58,603
...into the canister, which absorbs
the radiation, and cover it up...

478
00:36:00,978 --> 00:36:04,175
...I then find the count-rate
goes down substantially...

479
00:36:04,381 --> 00:36:06,076
...but it doesn't go down to zero.

480
00:36:07,284 --> 00:36:10,378
What's the source of the
remaining counts?

481
00:36:11,488 --> 00:36:15,948
Some of them come from radioactivity
in the walls of the cave.

482
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:18,354
But there's more to it than that.

483
00:36:18,562 --> 00:36:21,998
Some of the counts are due to
high-energy charged particles...

484
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:26,260
...which are penetrating the
roof of the cave.

485
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:29,598
We are listening to cosmic rays.

486
00:36:30,774 --> 00:36:35,234
Every second they are penetrating
my body...

487
00:36:35,445 --> 00:36:36,707
...and yours.

488
00:36:36,913 --> 00:36:40,178
They don't do much damage. Cosmic
rays have bombarded the Earth...

489
00:36:40,417 --> 00:36:43,011
...for the entire history of
life on our planet.

490
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,814
But they do cause some mutations...

491
00:36:46,023 --> 00:36:48,856
...and they do affect life
on the Earth.

492
00:36:50,994 --> 00:36:53,986
The cosmic rays, mainly protons...

493
00:36:54,197 --> 00:36:59,134
...are penetrating through the meters
of rock in the cave above me.

494
00:36:59,336 --> 00:37:02,032
To do this, they have to
be very energetic and in fact...

495
00:37:02,406 --> 00:37:05,466
...they are traveling almost
at the speed of light.

496
00:37:06,276 --> 00:37:07,675
Think of it.

497
00:37:08,145 --> 00:37:10,613
A star blows up...

498
00:37:10,947 --> 00:37:13,438
...thousands of light-years
away in space...

499
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:16,448
...and produces cosmic rays which...

500
00:37:16,653 --> 00:37:19,918
...spiral through the Milky Way
galaxy for...

501
00:37:20,123 --> 00:37:23,149
...millions of years until,
quite by accident...

502
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,124
...some of them strike the Earth...

503
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:30,231
...penetrate this cave,
reach this Geiger counter...

504
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,865
...and us.

505
00:37:32,235 --> 00:37:37,104
The evolution of life on Earth is
driven in part through mutations...

506
00:37:37,307 --> 00:37:40,401
...by the deaths of distant stars.

507
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:43,408
We are, in a very deep sense...

508
00:37:43,647 --> 00:37:46,377
...tied to the cosmos.

509
00:37:49,052 --> 00:37:51,987
Our ancestors knew this well.

510
00:37:52,189 --> 00:37:54,851
The movements of the sun, the moon,
and the stars...

511
00:37:55,058 --> 00:37:59,654
...could be used by those skilled in
such arts to foretell the seasons.

512
00:37:59,863 --> 00:38:02,798
So the ancient astronomers
all over the world...

513
00:38:02,999 --> 00:38:05,092
...studied the night sky with care...

514
00:38:05,302 --> 00:38:09,363
...memorizing and recording the
position of every visible star.

515
00:38:09,573 --> 00:38:13,976
To them, the appearance of any new
star would have been significant.

516
00:38:14,177 --> 00:38:18,614
What would they have made of the
apparition of a supernova...

517
00:38:18,815 --> 00:38:22,307
...brighter than every other
star in the sky?

518
00:38:28,692 --> 00:38:33,356
On July 4th, in the year 1054...

519
00:38:33,563 --> 00:38:38,500
...Chinese astronomers recorded what
they called a guest star...

520
00:38:38,702 --> 00:38:40,795
...in the constellation of
Taurus the Bull.

521
00:38:41,004 --> 00:38:45,134
A star never before seen
burst into radiance...

522
00:38:45,342 --> 00:38:48,470
...became almost as bright
as the full moon.

523
00:38:48,678 --> 00:38:53,115
Halfway around the world, here in
the American Southwest...

524
00:38:53,316 --> 00:38:58,015
...there was then a high culture,
rich in astronomical tradition.

525
00:38:58,221 --> 00:39:02,453
They too must have seen this
brilliant new star.

526
00:39:02,659 --> 00:39:06,026
From carbon-14 dating...

527
00:39:06,263 --> 00:39:10,723
...of the remains of a charcoal fire,
we know that in this very spot...

528
00:39:10,934 --> 00:39:14,563
...there were people living
in the 11th century.

529
00:39:15,305 --> 00:39:20,242
The people were the Anasazi, the
antecedents of the Hopi of today.

530
00:39:20,744 --> 00:39:23,645
And one of them
seems to have drawn...

531
00:39:23,914 --> 00:39:27,247
...on this overhang, protected
from the weather...

532
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:29,441
...a picture of the new star.

533
00:39:29,653 --> 00:39:34,090
Its position near the crescent moon
would have been just what we see here.

534
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:37,192
And the handprint is, perhaps...

535
00:39:37,394 --> 00:39:40,124
...the artist's signature.

536
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:45,290
This remarkable star is now
called the Crab Supernova.

537
00:39:45,502 --> 00:39:48,596
"Nova" from the Latin word for new
and "Crab" because...

538
00:39:48,805 --> 00:39:52,002
...that's what an astronomer centuries
later was reminded of...

539
00:39:52,209 --> 00:39:56,009
...when looking at this explosion or
remnant through the telescope.

540
00:39:56,213 --> 00:40:00,206
The Crab is a star that
blew itself up.

541
00:40:00,417 --> 00:40:03,181
The explosion was seen
for three months.

542
00:40:03,386 --> 00:40:07,254
It was easily visible
in broad daylight.

543
00:40:07,457 --> 00:40:10,324
And you could read by it at night.

544
00:40:12,462 --> 00:40:14,589
Imagine the night when that...

545
00:40:14,798 --> 00:40:17,426
...colossal stellar explosion...

546
00:40:17,634 --> 00:40:20,228
...first burst forth.

547
00:40:29,412 --> 00:40:30,811
A thousand years ago...

548
00:40:31,047 --> 00:40:34,574
...people gazed up in amazement
at the brilliant new star...

549
00:40:34,784 --> 00:40:37,218
...and wondered what it was.

550
00:40:41,258 --> 00:40:44,853
We are the first generation
privileged to know the answer.

551
00:40:45,061 --> 00:40:48,326
Through the telescope we have seen
what lies today...

552
00:40:48,531 --> 00:40:51,762
...at the spot in the sky noted
by the ancient astronomers.

553
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:55,563
A great luminous cloud,
the remains of a star...

554
00:40:55,772 --> 00:41:00,709
...violently unraveling itself back
into interstellar space.

555
00:41:06,049 --> 00:41:09,382
Only the massive red giants
become supernovas.

556
00:41:09,586 --> 00:41:12,680
But every supernova was
once a red giant.

557
00:41:12,889 --> 00:41:14,151
In the history of the galaxy...

558
00:41:14,357 --> 00:41:18,453
...hundreds of millions of red
giants have become supernovas.

559
00:41:21,131 --> 00:41:24,794
The bit of the star that isn't blown
away collapses under gravity...

560
00:41:25,001 --> 00:41:28,266
...spinning ever faster like a
pirouetting ice skater...

561
00:41:28,471 --> 00:41:29,802
...bringing in her arms.

562
00:41:30,006 --> 00:41:33,407
The star becomes a single, massive
atomic nucleus...

563
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:35,271
...a neutron star.

564
00:41:35,478 --> 00:41:38,709
The one in the Crab Nebula
is spinning 30 times a second.

565
00:41:38,915 --> 00:41:40,974
It emits a beamed pattern of light...

566
00:41:41,184 --> 00:41:45,018
...and seems to us to be blinking on
and off with astonishing regularity.

567
00:41:45,221 --> 00:41:48,952
Such neutron stars are
called pulsars.

568
00:41:50,593 --> 00:41:52,618
Neutron star matter...

569
00:41:52,829 --> 00:41:56,731
...weighs about a mountain
per teaspoonful.

570
00:41:56,933 --> 00:42:00,369
So much that if I had a piece of it
here and let it go...

571
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:02,936
...I could hardly
prevent it from falling.

572
00:42:03,139 --> 00:42:06,074
It would effortlessly pass through the
Earth like a...

573
00:42:06,276 --> 00:42:08,642
...a knife through warm butter.

574
00:42:08,845 --> 00:42:12,246
It would carve a hole for itself
completely through the Earth...

575
00:42:12,449 --> 00:42:16,476
...emerging out the other side
perhaps in China.

576
00:42:16,686 --> 00:42:20,315
The people there might be
walking along when a...

577
00:42:20,523 --> 00:42:25,324
...tiny lump of neutron star matter
comes booming out of the ground...

578
00:42:25,528 --> 00:42:27,155
...and then falls back again.

579
00:42:27,364 --> 00:42:28,797
The incident might...

580
00:42:29,032 --> 00:42:32,695
...make an agreeable break in the
routine of the day.

581
00:42:32,902 --> 00:42:36,303
The neutron star matter, pulled
back by the Earth's gravity...

582
00:42:36,506 --> 00:42:38,974
...would plunge again
through the Earth...

583
00:42:39,175 --> 00:42:43,578
...eventually punching hundreds of
thousands of holes...

584
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:48,581
...before friction with the interior
of our planet stopped the motion.

585
00:42:48,785 --> 00:42:50,946
By the time it's at rest at
the center of the Earth...

586
00:42:51,187 --> 00:42:55,886
...the inside of our world would look
a little bit like Swiss cheese.

587
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:15,739
There are places in the galaxy
where a neutron star and a red giant...

588
00:43:16,045 --> 00:43:19,981
...are locked in a mutual
gravitational embrace.

589
00:43:20,183 --> 00:43:22,549
Tendrils of red giant star stuff...

590
00:43:22,752 --> 00:43:25,585
...spiral into a disc
of accreting matter...

591
00:43:25,789 --> 00:43:29,190
...centered on the hot neutron star.

592
00:43:39,169 --> 00:43:42,297
Every star exists in
a state of tension...

593
00:43:42,505 --> 00:43:44,530
...between the force that
holds it up...

594
00:43:44,741 --> 00:43:47,209
...and gravity, the force that
would pull it down.

595
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:51,744
If gravity were to prevail, a
stellar madness would ensue...

596
00:43:51,948 --> 00:43:56,044
...more bizarre than
anything in wonderland.

597
00:43:57,654 --> 00:44:00,555
Alice and her colleagues feel,
more or less...

598
00:44:00,757 --> 00:44:03,317
...at home in the gravitational
pull of the Earth...

599
00:44:03,526 --> 00:44:06,324
...called one g,
"g" for Earth gravity.

600
00:44:06,729 --> 00:44:10,187
What would happen if we made the
gravity less, or more?

601
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,459
At lower gravity, things get lighter.

602
00:44:12,669 --> 00:44:15,433
Near zero g, the slightest motion
sends our friends...

603
00:44:15,638 --> 00:44:17,629
...floating and tumbling in the air.

604
00:44:17,841 --> 00:44:20,639
Little blobs of liquid
tea are everywhere.

605
00:44:21,077 --> 00:44:22,601
Curious.

606
00:44:23,146 --> 00:44:25,614
If we now return the gravity
to one g...

607
00:44:26,149 --> 00:44:30,210
...it's raining tea, and our friends
fall back to Earth.

608
00:44:31,588 --> 00:44:35,080
I've been to a couple of
parties like that myself.

609
00:44:37,093 --> 00:44:40,551
At higher gravities, two or
three g's, say, things get...

610
00:44:40,763 --> 00:44:43,391
...really laid back.

611
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,593
Everyone feels heavy and leaden.

612
00:44:50,273 --> 00:44:53,709
Except by special dispensation...

613
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:55,773
...the Cheshire cat.

614
00:44:56,579 --> 00:44:59,571
As a kindness, we remove them.

615
00:44:59,782 --> 00:45:03,274
At thousands of g's,
trees become squashed.

616
00:45:03,486 --> 00:45:07,923
At 100,000 g's, rocks
become crushed by their own weight.

617
00:45:08,124 --> 00:45:11,753
At all these gravities, a beam of
light remains unaffected...

618
00:45:11,961 --> 00:45:13,929
...continuing up in a straight line.

619
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:15,825
But at billions of g's...

620
00:45:16,032 --> 00:45:20,560
...a beam of light feels the gravity
and begins to bend back on itself.

621
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:24,228
Curiouser and curiouser.

622
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:28,501
Such a place, where the gravity is so
large that even light can't get out...

623
00:45:28,711 --> 00:45:31,202
...is called a black hole.

624
00:45:31,414 --> 00:45:34,679
It's a star in which light
itself is imprisoned.

625
00:45:34,884 --> 00:45:37,182
Black holes were
theoretical constructs...

626
00:45:37,387 --> 00:45:40,686
...speculated about since 1783.

627
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:44,485
But in our time, we've
verified the invisible.

628
00:45:44,694 --> 00:45:48,323
This bright star has a
massive, unseen companion.

629
00:45:48,531 --> 00:45:53,366
Satellite observatories find the
companion to be an x-ray source...

630
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:56,095
...called Cygnus X-1.

631
00:45:56,306 --> 00:45:58,866
These x-rays are like
the footprints...

632
00:45:59,075 --> 00:46:03,808
...of an invisible man
walking in the snow.

633
00:46:09,118 --> 00:46:12,178
The x-rays are thought to be
generated by friction...

634
00:46:12,388 --> 00:46:15,880
...in the accretion disc
surrounding the black hole.

635
00:46:16,092 --> 00:46:19,289
The matter in the disc
slowly disappears...

636
00:46:19,495 --> 00:46:21,463
...down the black hole.

637
00:46:23,967 --> 00:46:28,063
Massive black holes, produced by the
collapse of a billion suns...

638
00:46:28,271 --> 00:46:30,865
...may be sitting at the centers
of other galaxies...

639
00:46:31,074 --> 00:46:35,067
...curiously producing great
jets of radiation...

640
00:46:35,278 --> 00:46:37,371
...pouring out into space.

641
00:46:40,283 --> 00:46:43,980
At high enough density,
the star winks out...

642
00:46:44,187 --> 00:46:48,055
...and vanishes from our universe
leaving only its gravity behind.

643
00:46:48,257 --> 00:46:53,092
It slips through a self-generated
crack in the space-time continuum.

644
00:46:53,296 --> 00:46:57,596
A black hole is a place
where a star once was.

645
00:46:58,301 --> 00:47:01,168
Here we have a flat two-
dimensional surface...

646
00:47:01,371 --> 00:47:06,138
...with grid lines on it, something
like a piece of graph paper.

647
00:47:07,043 --> 00:47:09,204
Suppose we take a small mass...

648
00:47:09,412 --> 00:47:14,145
...drop it on the surface and
watch how the surface distorts...

649
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:18,218
...or puckers into
the third physical dimension.

650
00:47:22,091 --> 00:47:26,528
Gravity can be understood as
a curvature of space.

651
00:47:28,264 --> 00:47:31,290
If our moving ball approaches a
stationary distortion...

652
00:47:31,501 --> 00:47:34,868
...it rolls around it like a
planet orbiting the sun.

653
00:47:35,071 --> 00:47:39,474
In this interpretation, due to
Einstein, gravity is only a pucker...

654
00:47:39,676 --> 00:47:43,237
...in the fabric of space which
moving objects encounter.

655
00:47:43,446 --> 00:47:48,383
Space is warped by mass into an
additional physical dimension.

656
00:47:50,887 --> 00:47:55,483
The larger the local mass, the
greater is the local gravity...

657
00:47:55,692 --> 00:47:59,150
...and the more intense is
the distortion...

658
00:47:59,362 --> 00:48:02,559
...or pucker, or warp of space.

659
00:48:02,765 --> 00:48:04,858
So, by this analogy...

660
00:48:05,068 --> 00:48:09,698
...a black hole is a kind of
bottomless pit.

661
00:48:09,906 --> 00:48:11,771
What would happen if you fell in?

662
00:48:11,974 --> 00:48:15,171
Assuming you could survive the
gravitational tides...

663
00:48:15,378 --> 00:48:20,042
...and the intense radiation flux,
it is just barely possible...

664
00:48:20,249 --> 00:48:23,343
...that by plunging into
a black hole...

665
00:48:23,553 --> 00:48:27,319
...you might emerge in another
part of space-time.

666
00:48:27,523 --> 00:48:29,218
Somewhere else in space...

667
00:48:29,425 --> 00:48:33,020
...some-when else in time.

668
00:48:33,229 --> 00:48:35,163
In this view, space is...

669
00:48:35,364 --> 00:48:38,356
...filled with a network
of wormholes...

670
00:48:38,568 --> 00:48:40,433
...something like the wormholes
in an apple.

671
00:48:40,636 --> 00:48:43,730
Although by no means is this
point demonstrated...

672
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:47,137
...it is merely an exciting suggestion.

673
00:48:47,343 --> 00:48:48,742
If it is true...

674
00:48:48,945 --> 00:48:52,938
...then perhaps there exist
gravity tunnels...

675
00:48:53,149 --> 00:48:56,550
...a kind of interstellar or
intergalactic subway...

676
00:48:56,753 --> 00:48:58,482
...which would permit you
to get from...

677
00:48:58,688 --> 00:49:01,179
...here to there in much less than
the usual time.

678
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:05,349
A kind of cosmic rapid transit system.

679
00:49:08,064 --> 00:49:10,464
We cannot generate black holes...

680
00:49:10,666 --> 00:49:13,396
...our technology is far
too feeble to...

681
00:49:13,603 --> 00:49:16,299
...move such massive amounts
of matter around.

682
00:49:16,506 --> 00:49:19,498
But perhaps someday, it will be
possible to voyage hundreds or...

683
00:49:19,709 --> 00:49:23,577
...thousands of light-years to
a black hole like Cygnus X-1.

684
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:25,941
We would plunge down to emerge...

685
00:49:26,149 --> 00:49:29,209
...in some unimaginably
exotic time and place.

686
00:49:29,418 --> 00:49:34,082
Our common-sense notions of reality
severely challenged.

687
00:49:36,325 --> 00:49:38,987
Perhaps the cosmos is infested
with wormholes...

688
00:49:39,195 --> 00:49:41,527
...every one of them a
tunnel to somewhere.

689
00:49:41,731 --> 00:49:45,963
Perhaps other civilizations, with
vastly more advanced technologies...

690
00:49:46,169 --> 00:49:50,572
...are today riding the
gravity express.

691
00:49:52,875 --> 00:49:56,572
It's even possible that a
black hole is a gate...

692
00:49:56,779 --> 00:50:00,146
...to another, and
quite different, universe.

693
00:50:38,187 --> 00:50:40,678
The lives and deaths of the stars...

694
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:44,291
...seem impossibly remote
from human experience...

695
00:50:44,493 --> 00:50:48,395
...and yet we're related in the most
intimate way to their life cycles.

696
00:50:48,598 --> 00:50:50,566
The very matter that makes us up...

697
00:50:50,766 --> 00:50:55,703
...was generated long ago and far away
in red giant stars.

698
00:50:56,806 --> 00:51:00,469
A blade of grass,
as Walt Whitman said...

699
00:51:00,676 --> 00:51:02,906
"...is the journey work of the stars."

700
00:51:03,112 --> 00:51:04,636
The formation of the solar system...

701
00:51:04,847 --> 00:51:07,975
...may have been triggered by a
nearby supernova explosion.

702
00:51:08,184 --> 00:51:09,674
After the sun turned on...

703
00:51:09,886 --> 00:51:12,719
...its ultraviolet light poured
into our atmosphere.

704
00:51:12,922 --> 00:51:14,913
Its warmth generated lightning.

705
00:51:15,124 --> 00:51:18,025
And these energy sources sparked
the origin of life.

706
00:51:19,061 --> 00:51:21,393
Plants harvest sunlight...

707
00:51:21,597 --> 00:51:24,498
...converting solar into
chemical energy.

708
00:51:25,301 --> 00:51:28,395
We and the other animals are
parasites on the plants.

709
00:51:28,604 --> 00:51:32,540
So we are, all of us, solar-powered.

710
00:51:32,942 --> 00:51:35,433
The evolution of life is
driven by mutations.

711
00:51:35,645 --> 00:51:39,775
They are caused partly by natural
radioactivity and cosmic rays.

712
00:51:39,982 --> 00:51:44,282
But they are both generated in the
spectacular deaths of massive stars...

713
00:51:44,487 --> 00:51:46,478
...thousands of light-years distant.

714
00:51:48,024 --> 00:51:51,653
Think of the sun's heat on your
upturned face...

715
00:51:51,861 --> 00:51:54,125
...on a cloudless summer's day.

716
00:51:54,330 --> 00:51:57,458
From 150 million kilometers away...

717
00:51:57,667 --> 00:52:00,135
...we recognize its power.

718
00:52:00,336 --> 00:52:04,170
What would we feel on its seething,
self-luminous surface...

719
00:52:04,373 --> 00:52:07,831
...or immersed in its heart
of nuclear fire?

720
00:52:08,044 --> 00:52:12,981
And yet, the sun is an ordinary,
even a mediocre star.

721
00:52:13,215 --> 00:52:17,049
Our ancestors worshiped the sun
and they were far from foolish.

722
00:52:17,253 --> 00:52:20,051
It makes good sense to revere
the sun and the stars.

723
00:52:20,256 --> 00:52:24,215
Because we are their children.

724
00:52:27,196 --> 00:52:31,292
We have witnessed the life
cycles of the stars.

725
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:35,937
They are born, they mature
and then they die.

726
00:52:36,138 --> 00:52:38,402
As time goes on, there are
more white dwarfs...

727
00:52:38,607 --> 00:52:41,098
...more neutron stars,
more black holes.

728
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:44,143
The remains of the stars accumulate...

729
00:52:44,347 --> 00:52:46,440
...as the eons pass.

730
00:52:46,649 --> 00:52:50,415
But interstellar space also becomes
enriched in heavy elements...

731
00:52:50,619 --> 00:52:54,578
...out of which form new generations
of stars and planets...

732
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:56,849
...life and intelligence.

733
00:52:57,059 --> 00:53:01,257
The events in one star can influence
a world halfway across the galaxy...

734
00:53:01,464 --> 00:53:03,694
...and a billion years in the future.

735
00:53:11,107 --> 00:53:14,634
The vast interstellar clouds
of gas and dust...

736
00:53:14,844 --> 00:53:16,471
...are stellar nurseries.

737
00:53:16,679 --> 00:53:20,740
Here first begins the inexorable
gravitational collapse...

738
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:24,010
...which dominates the
lives of the stars.

739
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:28,623
Massive suns may evolve through the
red giant stage in only millions of years.

740
00:53:28,824 --> 00:53:33,090
Dying young, never leaving the
cloud in which they were born.

741
00:53:35,131 --> 00:53:39,693
Other suns, longer-lived, wander
out of the nursery.

742
00:53:39,902 --> 00:53:42,029
Our sun is such a star...

743
00:53:42,238 --> 00:53:45,298
...as are most
of the stars in the sky.

744
00:53:56,485 --> 00:54:01,047
Most stars are members of double
or multiple star systems...

745
00:54:01,257 --> 00:54:05,557
...and live to process their nuclear
fuel over billions of years.

746
00:54:05,761 --> 00:54:08,821
The galaxy is 10 billion years old.

747
00:54:09,031 --> 00:54:10,623
Old enough to have spawned...

748
00:54:10,833 --> 00:54:14,599
...only a few generations
of ordinary stars.

749
00:54:19,408 --> 00:54:22,741
The objects we encounter
in a voyage through the Milky Way...

750
00:54:22,945 --> 00:54:27,075
...are stages in the life cycle
of the stars.

751
00:54:27,283 --> 00:54:29,513
Some are bright and new...

752
00:54:29,718 --> 00:54:33,711
...and others are as ancient as
the galaxy itself.

753
00:54:45,568 --> 00:54:49,095
Surrounding the Milky Way
is a halo of matter...

754
00:54:49,305 --> 00:54:52,297
...which includes
the globular clusters...

755
00:54:52,508 --> 00:54:55,944
...each containing up to
a million elderly stars.

756
00:54:56,145 --> 00:55:00,514
At the centers of globular clusters
and at the core of the galaxy...

757
00:55:00,716 --> 00:55:05,380
...there may be massive black holes
ticking and purring...

758
00:55:05,588 --> 00:55:08,113
...the subject of future exploration.

759
00:55:26,008 --> 00:55:28,943
We on Earth marvel,
and rightly so...

760
00:55:29,145 --> 00:55:32,171
...at the daily return
of our single sun.

761
00:55:32,381 --> 00:55:36,147
But from a planet orbiting a star
in a distant globular cluster...

762
00:55:36,352 --> 00:55:39,185
...a still more glorious dawn awaits.

763
00:55:39,388 --> 00:55:42,653
Not a sunrise, but a galaxy-rise.

764
00:55:42,858 --> 00:55:46,589
A morning filled with
400 billion suns...

765
00:55:46,795 --> 00:55:49,059
...the rising of the Milky Way.

766
00:55:49,265 --> 00:55:53,167
An enormous spiral form
with collapsing gas clouds...

767
00:55:53,369 --> 00:55:57,100
...condensing planetary systems,
luminous supergiants...

768
00:55:57,306 --> 00:55:59,274
...stable middle-aged stars...

769
00:55:59,475 --> 00:56:03,844
...red giants, white dwarfs, planetary
nebulas, supernovas...

770
00:56:04,046 --> 00:56:08,483
...neutron stars, pulsars,
black holes and...

771
00:56:08,717 --> 00:56:11,686
...there is every reason to think,
other exotic objects...

772
00:56:11,921 --> 00:56:14,116
...that we have not yet discovered.

773
00:56:17,126 --> 00:56:20,994
From such a world, high above
the disc of the Milky Way...

774
00:56:21,197 --> 00:56:25,224
...it would be clear as it is
beginning to be clear on our world...

775
00:56:25,434 --> 00:56:28,494
...that we are made
by the atoms in the stars...

776
00:56:28,704 --> 00:56:32,765
...that our matter
and our form are determined...

777
00:56:32,975 --> 00:56:36,570
...by the cosmos
of which we are a part.

778
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:49,186
I only have a moment, but I wanted you
to see a picture of Betelgeuse...

779
00:56:49,391 --> 00:56:51,325
...in the constellation Orion.

780
00:56:51,527 --> 00:56:54,621
The first image of the surface
of another star.

781
00:56:54,897 --> 00:56:57,559
But the most exciting recent
stellar discovery...

782
00:56:57,766 --> 00:56:59,597
...has been of a nearby supernova...

783
00:56:59,802 --> 00:57:01,997
...in a companion galaxy
to the Milky Way.

784
00:57:02,204 --> 00:57:06,504
We are here seeing chemical elements
in the process of synthesis...

785
00:57:06,709 --> 00:57:10,270
...and have had our first glimpse
of the supernova...

786
00:57:10,479 --> 00:57:13,642
...through a brand-new field:
neutrino astronomy.

787
00:57:13,849 --> 00:57:17,046
And we're now seeing, around
neighboring stars...

788
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:21,317
...discs of gas and dust just
like those needed to explain...

789
00:57:21,523 --> 00:57:24,253
...the origin of the planets
in our solar system.

790
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:27,190
Worlds may be forming here.

791
00:57:27,396 --> 00:57:30,661
It's like a snapshot of our
solar system's past.

792
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:34,228
And there are so many such
discs being found these days...

793
00:57:34,436 --> 00:57:38,964
...that planets may be very common
among the stars of the Milky Way.
