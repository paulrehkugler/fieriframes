1
00:00:02,164 --> 00:00:04,997
<i>It all started when a time-travel
experiment I was conducting... </i>

2
00:00:05,067 --> 00:00:08,002
<i>went... a little caca. </i>

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,562
<i>In the blink of a cosmic clock, </i>
<i>I went from quantum physicist... </i>

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,007
<i>... to air force test pilot, </i>

5
00:00:15,077 --> 00:00:18,478
<i>which could have been fun</i>
<i>if I knew how to fly. </i>

6
00:00:18,547 --> 00:00:22,244
<i>Fortunately, I had help... </i>
<i>an observer from the project named Al. </i>

7
00:00:22,318 --> 00:00:26,755
<i>Unfortunately, Al's a hologram, </i>
<i>so all he can lend is moral support. </i>

8
00:00:26,822 --> 00:00:29,814
<i>Anyway, here I am, </i>
<i>bouncing around in time, </i>

9
00:00:29,892 --> 00:00:31,826
<i>putting things right</i>
<i>that once went wrong... </i>

10
00:00:31,894 --> 00:00:35,921
<i>a sort of time-traveling Lone Ranger</i>
<i>with Al as my Tonto, </i>

11
00:00:35,998 --> 00:00:38,933
<i>and I don't even need a mask. </i>

12
00:00:39,935 --> 00:00:41,459
Oh, boy.

13
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:59,447
<i>Bouncing around in time</i>
<i>can be a little disorienting, </i>

14
00:01:59,515 --> 00:02:02,541
<i>a little taxing on the nerves, </i>

15
00:02:02,618 --> 00:02:06,019
<i>a little jolting to the... equilibrium. </i>

16
00:02:07,156 --> 00:02:09,954
<i>It can also be very rewarding. </i>

17
00:02:10,025 --> 00:02:12,585
<i>Unfortunately, like the Bible says, </i>

18
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:14,652
<i>the Lord giveth... </i>

19
00:02:18,167 --> 00:02:20,397
<i>And the Lord taketh away. </i>

20
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,385
Not gonna do it.
I want heirs, Tess.

21
00:02:37,453 --> 00:02:41,287
I want Riata to stay in the family,
to go to my grandsons.

22
00:02:41,356 --> 00:02:45,520
Well, I don't see that happening, Chance.
So if you're so damn set on disinheriting me...

23
00:02:45,594 --> 00:02:48,427
if I don't lift up my tail
and act like a brood mare,

24
00:02:48,497 --> 00:02:52,627
then maybe you should figure out some way to
take the spread with you when the time comes.

25
00:02:52,701 --> 00:02:56,269
It's all my fault. I raised you
to run this place like a man,

26
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:58,571
and now you don't
know how to be a woman.

27
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,406
That's just fine with me. I never
did take to sashayin' and swoonin'.

28
00:03:02,478 --> 00:03:06,278
Well, your mama, God rest her soul, she'd
have made a woman of you instead of a cowboy.

29
00:03:06,348 --> 00:03:08,816
Why can't I be both?
'Cause it ain't natural.

30
00:03:08,884 --> 00:03:12,081
Get married, Tess.
Who do you expect me to marry?

31
00:03:12,154 --> 00:03:14,418
Ben or Eddie...

32
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,856
or Zeke?

33
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,652
I won't breed with inferior stock,
Chance.

34
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,164
The man I marry has to be
more of a man than I am.

35
00:03:24,233 --> 00:03:27,202
Now, daughter, I'm here to tell you.
I don't want to hurt your feelings,

36
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:30,636
but any man on this ranch
is more man than you are.

37
00:03:30,706 --> 00:03:35,143
Bull. Nobody here can keep
up with me, including Wayne.

38
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:38,111
Aw, now you're talkin'
like a fool, girl.

39
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,125
And I'll tell you what. If
there's a man on this ranch

40
00:03:40,126 --> 00:03:42,549
who can keep up with me for
one week, then I'll marry him.

41
00:03:42,618 --> 00:03:46,520
But if he can't, then we forget about
this marriage business once and for all.

42
00:03:46,588 --> 00:03:49,489
Honey, you just overplayed your hand.
I pick.

43
00:03:49,558 --> 00:03:52,959
No. I pick him.

44
00:03:53,028 --> 00:03:54,791
I pick...

45
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,697
Him.

46
00:04:03,772 --> 00:04:06,570
Tess, you can't be serious.

47
00:04:06,642 --> 00:04:09,736
You said any man on the ranch,
Chance, and a deal's a deal.

48
00:04:09,811 --> 00:04:12,678
Right, Doc? Right.

49
00:04:12,748 --> 00:04:15,876
- You go for it, Doc?
- Go for what?

50
00:04:15,951 --> 00:04:20,320
Marriage, son.
To Tess and 50,000 acres of Riata.

51
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:24,485
If you can outride,
out rope and all-around out cowboy me.

52
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,018
- You're kiddin', right?
- This is Texas, son.

53
00:04:28,096 --> 00:04:32,533
We don't kid about our land,
our women or our livestock.

54
00:04:32,601 --> 00:04:37,368
- Now, what's the matter with that little pig?
- Uh... Wha...

55
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:43,378
- It's hog cholera, ain't it?
- Hog cholera, uh...

56
00:04:43,445 --> 00:04:46,608
Well, you... you never know with pigs.

57
00:04:46,682 --> 00:04:52,245
Damn, I was afraid of that. We're gonna
have to shoot the whole mess of'em.

58
00:04:52,321 --> 00:04:54,585
- Shoot 'em?
- Then burn 'em.

59
00:04:56,792 --> 00:04:58,885
No, no, no, no, no. You can't...
You can't shoot 'em,

60
00:04:58,961 --> 00:05:04,058
because I, uh, haven't made
a... a diagnosis yet.

61
00:05:04,132 --> 00:05:06,464
Uh, okay?

62
00:05:14,042 --> 00:05:16,476
Well, what do ya say?

63
00:05:16,545 --> 00:05:20,743
I'll take the pig.
You keep the daughter.

64
00:05:30,392 --> 00:05:34,055
Well, pick another one.
Nope. It's Doc or nothin'.

65
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:37,257
Come on, Tess.
Or nothin', Chance.

66
00:05:42,137 --> 00:05:44,128
Doc's a fool.

67
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,316
<i>Thad and me... </i>

68
00:05:55,384 --> 00:05:58,353
<i>... thad and me</i>

69
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:04,290
<i>All he does is chew and chew</i>

70
00:06:07,829 --> 00:06:13,161
<i>Thad and me</i>

71
00:06:13,235 --> 00:06:16,796
<i>All he does is</i>

72
00:06:16,872 --> 00:06:19,204
<i>Baa at me</i>

73
00:06:26,315 --> 00:06:27,288
<i>Every time I leap, </i>

74
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:31,912
<i>I do this song and dance to find </i>
<i>out who I am and where I live. </i>

75
00:06:31,987 --> 00:06:35,946
<i>Sometimes... it's hard, </i>

76
00:06:36,024 --> 00:06:38,959
<i>and sometimes it's easy. </i>

77
00:06:39,027 --> 00:06:44,590
<i>All he does is baa at me</i>

78
00:06:47,636 --> 00:06:51,684
<i>Figuring out the names of everyone I'm
supposed to know is a little tougher, </i>

79
00:06:51,685 --> 00:06:53,370
<i>especially if they're alone. </i>

80
00:06:53,442 --> 00:06:57,538
- Hey, Doc.
- Hi, uh, pard.

81
00:06:57,612 --> 00:07:00,843
What happened to you?

82
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:03,214
Oh, just had a little accident.

83
00:07:03,285 --> 00:07:06,083
Looks like you got us
another patient there.

84
00:07:06,154 --> 00:07:08,712
Yeah, gotta figure out what's
causin' this little guy's runny nose.

85
00:07:08,713 --> 00:07:09,954
Think it might be the hog cholera?

86
00:07:10,025 --> 00:07:12,550
No, it's not hog chol... cholera.

87
00:07:12,627 --> 00:07:14,618
Whatever you say, Doc.

88
00:07:14,696 --> 00:07:19,497
Listen, I fed and watered all the
animals and, uh, cleaned out the cages.

89
00:07:19,568 --> 00:07:23,197
Thanks, uh, pard.

90
00:07:23,271 --> 00:07:27,605
See ya tomorrow, Doc.
Come on, Pard. Let's go.

91
00:07:33,482 --> 00:07:36,042
Couldn't you give 'em name tags?

92
00:07:36,118 --> 00:07:38,109
Or tattoos.

93
00:07:41,923 --> 00:07:45,552
Tina's got her name in a tattoo.

94
00:07:45,627 --> 00:07:48,460
Course, that wouldn't do you much good,
because it's...

95
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,693
It's in a super private part
of her anatomy.

96
00:07:53,135 --> 00:07:58,402
Of course, she always thought
you were kind of cute.

97
00:07:58,473 --> 00:08:03,775
Uh, Sam, you've never seen
Tina's tattoo, have you?

98
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,652
- You didn't answer my question, Sam.
- What?

99
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:27,396
- Did you ever see Tina's tattoo?
- Are you serious?

100
00:08:27,469 --> 00:08:30,063
You've seen it.

101
00:08:31,473 --> 00:08:36,342
Al, I don't even remember Tina,
let alone her tattoo.

102
00:08:36,411 --> 00:08:40,973
- You're hiding behind your Swiss cheese brain.
- What the hell is wrong with you?

103
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:45,611
Nah, it couldn't be you.
You're stuck here in 1956.

104
00:08:45,687 --> 00:08:48,998
56's? I'm still a baby. My
sister Kate's not even born yet.

105
00:08:48,999 --> 00:08:50,488
Who's President, Eisenhower?

106
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:53,790
- Ike Bentenhoff.
- What?

107
00:08:53,862 --> 00:08:55,296
He works in Imaging Control.

108
00:08:55,297 --> 00:08:59,596
At the Christmas party, when Lucille and
I slipped off into the energizing chamber...

109
00:08:59,668 --> 00:09:01,932
- to... to...
- I know, I know.

110
00:09:02,003 --> 00:09:07,873
Exchange gifts, that dirty dog took
advantage of my absence to cozy up to Tina.

111
00:09:07,943 --> 00:09:12,346
- Tina's cheating on you?
- Can you believe it?

112
00:09:12,414 --> 00:09:14,712
It boggles the mind.

113
00:09:19,387 --> 00:09:21,582
Come in here, Al.

114
00:09:23,358 --> 00:09:25,758
It's like Noah's Ark.

115
00:09:25,827 --> 00:09:28,159
Well, this is kinda fun.

116
00:09:30,165 --> 00:09:33,464
Oh, listen, Al. You figure out
what I'm here to do?

117
00:09:33,535 --> 00:09:37,096
Oh, uh, no, I haven't finished
the computation yet.

118
00:09:37,172 --> 00:09:39,163
Uh, just a second.

119
00:09:40,342 --> 00:09:42,503
Uh, well, according to Ziggy,

120
00:09:42,577 --> 00:09:47,674
there's a 72% chance
you're here to cure the pig.

121
00:09:47,749 --> 00:09:52,846
For a minute I thought I was
here to marry Tess. Huh! Oh.

122
00:09:52,921 --> 00:09:56,721
"Oh, " what? Oh, oh, well, I haven't
run a number on that yet. Wait.

123
00:09:58,593 --> 00:10:00,754
Oh, it's not so bad, Sam.

124
00:10:00,829 --> 00:10:04,856
Uh, there's only a 47% chance
you're gonna marry this girl Tess.

125
00:10:04,933 --> 00:10:09,063
- Hey, Al, do pigs like milk?
- Oh, they adore it.

126
00:10:09,137 --> 00:10:12,595
Do you know what's wrong with this...
with him?

127
00:10:12,674 --> 00:10:15,939
Uh, it's not a him, Sam. It's a girl.

128
00:10:16,011 --> 00:10:18,639
Trust me, Sam.

129
00:10:21,816 --> 00:10:25,877
Runny nose, watery eyes...

130
00:10:25,954 --> 00:10:30,118
Squeaky voice... loud squeaky voice.

131
00:10:32,527 --> 00:10:34,688
I don't know, Al. I don't know...

132
00:10:34,763 --> 00:10:38,631
Al. Al, that raccoon can see you.

133
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,931
Oh, well, almost all animals can see me.

134
00:10:42,003 --> 00:10:44,346
But, you know, there must be
somethin' weird lookin' about me,

135
00:10:44,347 --> 00:10:46,030
because I seem to intimidate them.

136
00:10:46,107 --> 00:10:48,371
Maybe it's your clothes.

137
00:10:51,346 --> 00:10:55,646
Hey, Al.
Here's a scrapbook on Tess McGill.

138
00:10:57,986 --> 00:11:01,478
- Look at this.
- What?

139
00:11:01,556 --> 00:11:04,320
Well, it-it's Doc's diary.

140
00:11:04,392 --> 00:11:07,793
Correction, it's your diary.

141
00:11:07,862 --> 00:11:10,626
Well, technically it is, but,

142
00:11:10,699 --> 00:11:13,793
I mean, you know,
in reality it's...

143
00:11:13,868 --> 00:11:17,599
Just go ahead
and read the diary, Sam.

144
00:11:19,975 --> 00:11:24,173
"I saw her today. She was having trouble
getting her prize stallion to mate.

145
00:11:24,245 --> 00:11:26,770
That's a cross we all have to bear...

146
00:11:26,848 --> 00:11:30,545
performance under pressure.

147
00:11:30,619 --> 00:11:33,918
"I wanted to take her in my arms,
to kiss her cheeks, her eyes, her lips,

148
00:11:33,989 --> 00:11:36,685
"but after all these years,
I'm still dumbstruck in her presence.

149
00:11:36,758 --> 00:11:40,751
Will I ever have the courage
to tell Tess how much I love her?"

150
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:43,662
Al, Doc's in love with Tess.

151
00:11:43,732 --> 00:11:45,996
Uh-oh.
"Uh-oh, " what?

152
00:11:46,067 --> 00:11:49,662
Well, uh, there's a 97% probability...

153
00:11:49,738 --> 00:11:53,606
that someone who's been sending
her love letters will marry Tess.

154
00:11:53,675 --> 00:11:58,612
Well, uh, then I'm okay, because this is a diary.
It's not love letters.

155
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,911
Don't fight it, Sam.
You're here to marry this cowboy.

156
00:12:01,983 --> 00:12:05,612
Uh, boy-girl. Cowgirl. Girl.

157
00:12:15,196 --> 00:12:17,187
Tess, look here.

158
00:12:23,471 --> 00:12:25,405
Mornin', Doc.

159
00:12:25,473 --> 00:12:27,464
Chance.

160
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,142
Does your bein' here
mean we got to shoot 'em?

161
00:12:31,212 --> 00:12:33,203
Shoot 'em?

162
00:12:33,281 --> 00:12:36,182
Oh, uh, no, no. Uh, I haven't
figured out what's wrong with Piggy,

163
00:12:36,251 --> 00:12:38,185
but it's not hog cholera.
Piggy?

164
00:12:38,253 --> 00:12:42,587
That's what I-I... named the little pig.

165
00:12:42,657 --> 00:12:44,648
Piggy.

166
00:12:44,726 --> 00:12:47,388
Then you're here
to take me on, Doc?

167
00:12:47,462 --> 00:12:51,922
That's right, Tess.
I'm here to take you on.

168
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,231
Yahoo, boys!
We got us a contest!

169
00:12:59,274 --> 00:13:01,742
Get you in shape.

170
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:04,540
Come on. Take this, would ya?
Take this thing.

171
00:13:04,612 --> 00:13:06,773
Easy.

172
00:13:06,848 --> 00:13:09,009
Here, Doc. You don't have to do that. Oh.

173
00:13:09,084 --> 00:13:11,075
Take that one.
Thanks.

174
00:13:20,228 --> 00:13:22,719
First thing my Dad taught me
about mounting an unknown horse...

175
00:13:22,797 --> 00:13:27,461
was to look him straight in the eye
and show him who's boss.

176
00:13:27,535 --> 00:13:31,062
Then, with a good grip on the reins,

177
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:33,767
mount quickly and take a firm seat.

178
00:13:33,842 --> 00:13:36,743
After that, the rest was easy.

179
00:13:47,021 --> 00:13:49,387
Uuh!

180
00:13:54,863 --> 00:13:59,630
<i>Hey, Doc! Got a bottle of liniment for
you right here! Get up there!</i>

181
00:14:00,735 --> 00:14:02,930
What the hell's got into you, Doc?

182
00:14:03,004 --> 00:14:06,838
All of Texas knows nobody's ever
ridden Widowmaker, except me.

183
00:14:11,479 --> 00:14:13,470
Ooh!

184
00:14:17,051 --> 00:14:19,952
Hope you don't mind, Doc.

185
00:14:24,225 --> 00:14:26,716
Just a little cowboy humor.

186
00:14:26,795 --> 00:14:29,992
Well, I...
I always liked a good joke.

187
00:14:59,394 --> 00:15:02,761
Ever do any ropin', Doc?

188
00:15:02,831 --> 00:15:05,095
Well, it's been a while.

189
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,634
You, uh, knot your rope to the horn,
or you dally it?

190
00:15:07,702 --> 00:15:11,138
- Dally?
- From the Mex... dale vuelta.

191
00:15:11,206 --> 00:15:13,197
It means to give it a turn.

192
00:15:13,274 --> 00:15:15,868
See, you just take the rope
in your hand like this,

193
00:15:15,944 --> 00:15:19,107
give it a turn
around the horn for leverage.

194
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:22,513
Easier to release.

195
00:15:22,584 --> 00:15:25,519
It's your turn, Doc. You up to it?

196
00:15:25,587 --> 00:15:29,114
Dale... Vuelta.

197
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:32,091
- Dale vuelta.
- Yeah. Go get 'em.

198
00:15:34,596 --> 00:15:35,995
Yah!

199
00:15:44,505 --> 00:15:47,167
What were you two palaverin' about?

200
00:15:47,242 --> 00:15:50,734
Oh, I was just, uh,
showin' him how to dally his rope.

201
00:16:10,498 --> 00:16:14,434
You tell him to keep his thumb up?

202
00:16:14,502 --> 00:16:17,596
Wayne, if he's not careful
that rope will jerk his thumb off.

203
00:16:17,672 --> 00:16:20,038
You wanna win this contest or not?

204
00:16:21,442 --> 00:16:24,900
Now, I'm tellin' you somethin'.
The main mistake you're makin' is...

205
00:16:24,979 --> 00:16:27,447
pick one and stay on him, patient.

206
00:16:27,515 --> 00:16:31,611
Even if another one is closer,
don't go after this'un and after that'un.

207
00:16:31,686 --> 00:16:36,282
Pick one and stay with that one.
Now go try it again. Go on.

208
00:16:36,357 --> 00:16:40,123
Whoo! Yeah!

209
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,676
Gosh, Doc. Didn't I tell you
to keep your thumb up?

210
00:16:55,743 --> 00:16:58,177
- No!
- I'm sorry.

211
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,641
God!

212
00:17:01,716 --> 00:17:05,482
I guess I'll just have to...
grow a new one.

213
00:17:08,856 --> 00:17:11,848
Heh! Just a little
cowboy humor there, Wayne.

214
00:17:11,926 --> 00:17:14,087
Yeah. Giddap!

215
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,888
Where you goin', Doc?

216
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:49,157
Oh, I just... I thought I might
go home and have a hot bath,

217
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:54,293
eat a little supper, have a hot
bath... Well, we got business in town.

218
00:17:54,369 --> 00:17:58,066
There's a buyer interested in one of our prize
bulls, and if you intend to run Riata with me,

219
00:17:58,139 --> 00:18:01,472
- I think maybe you better come along.
- Without a bath?

220
00:18:01,542 --> 00:18:03,874
You got it, cowboy.

221
00:18:03,945 --> 00:18:06,846
Bonanza was never like this.

222
00:18:20,928 --> 00:18:23,089
Wayne, I want a good hand.

223
00:18:23,164 --> 00:18:25,325
Yeah, I know you do.

224
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,392
Now, Orly, you weren't serious
when you offered 6,000...

225
00:18:28,469 --> 00:18:31,597
for my prize-winnin' bull,
were you?

226
00:18:31,672 --> 00:18:37,042
I heard rumors that bull's gone the way
of Hollywood, if you know what I mean.

227
00:18:37,111 --> 00:18:42,276
Not true, Orly. Hell, half my
heifers are fightin'to get near him,

228
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:45,547
and the other half
just sit back and admire his work.

229
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:49,181
Now, don't ya think 7, 500
would be a more Christian offer?

230
00:18:49,257 --> 00:18:51,191
Hmm.

231
00:18:52,927 --> 00:18:56,124
No, thanks.
I'll just stick with beer.

232
00:18:56,197 --> 00:18:59,291
Part of bein' a cowboy is bein' able to hold
your liquor while you're holdin' your cards.

233
00:18:59,367 --> 00:19:01,426
I said, no, thank you.
And I said drink it.

234
00:19:01,502 --> 00:19:02,901
- Wayne!
- What?

235
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:06,030
Back off. Well, ante up, Doc.

236
00:19:06,107 --> 00:19:09,873
You're losin'bad, and I ain't marryin'
no man who can't beat me at poker.

237
00:19:12,613 --> 00:19:16,549
Tina and I met
over a poker table...

238
00:19:16,617 --> 00:19:18,608
in Las Vegas.

239
00:19:19,687 --> 00:19:22,952
I had a flush. She had a pair.

240
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,949
Oh, what a pair.

241
00:19:26,027 --> 00:19:29,963
- Gimme two, Wayne.
- She ran out on me, Sam.

242
00:19:30,031 --> 00:19:33,125
She took my second-most-favorite organ...

243
00:19:33,201 --> 00:19:37,228
and stomped it to death
with her four-inch spike heels.

244
00:19:37,305 --> 00:19:41,799
- Coulda been worse.
- You tryin' to bluff us there, Doc?

245
00:19:46,747 --> 00:19:51,343
You'll never guess who she ran off with...
Gooshie.

246
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:54,252
- Gooshie?
- Gooshie?

247
00:19:54,322 --> 00:19:56,313
Yeah. G-G-Gooshie.

248
00:19:56,390 --> 00:20:00,292
It's, uh, Navajo for...

249
00:20:01,462 --> 00:20:03,453
I'll see ya.

250
00:20:03,531 --> 00:20:06,261
You know,
you're wasting your money, Sam.

251
00:20:06,334 --> 00:20:09,167
Three kings.
He's got a full boat, aces over eights.

252
00:20:09,237 --> 00:20:11,171
Wayne?

253
00:20:11,239 --> 00:20:15,835
Yeah. Two dollars and, uh,

254
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,844
two more.

255
00:20:17,912 --> 00:20:20,278
He's cheating.

256
00:20:20,348 --> 00:20:24,375
He took the best cards from the
last hand, three aces and two eights.

257
00:20:24,452 --> 00:20:26,613
That's what he's got,
aces and eights.

258
00:20:26,687 --> 00:20:27,717
What about it, Doc?

259
00:20:27,718 --> 00:20:31,784
You gonna stare into space like a
castrated steer, or are you gonna call me?

260
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:34,225
- Can't beat a full boat.
- How do you know what I'm holding?

261
00:20:34,295 --> 00:20:37,128
Because you're cheating.

262
00:20:44,939 --> 00:20:47,339
- That's it.
- Hold it, Wayne.

263
00:20:49,911 --> 00:20:52,072
Doc, you better know
what you're sayin'.

264
00:20:52,146 --> 00:20:56,139
- I do. Tell them Wayne was palming,
- He was palming,

265
00:20:56,217 --> 00:20:58,208
stacking, shifting,
stacking, shifting...

266
00:20:58,286 --> 00:21:01,585
dealing seconds, dealing base,
dealing sides... cheating.

267
00:21:01,656 --> 00:21:04,250
- Cheating.
- That's why I know...

268
00:21:04,325 --> 00:21:07,988
that... he's got aces and eights.

269
00:21:09,497 --> 00:21:13,058
I got a right to stomp him, Chance.
Not if he's tellin' the truth.

270
00:21:13,134 --> 00:21:15,932
And there's an easy way to find out.

271
00:21:20,908 --> 00:21:23,604
He was cheating, Sam. I swear it.

272
00:21:27,114 --> 00:21:30,770
Uh, Wayne, look, I'm sorry.
I apologize. I just...

273
00:21:30,771 --> 00:21:32,347
That ain't good enough.

274
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,115
Yes, it is.

275
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,759
Buy me a drink, Wayne.

276
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,730
Well, Orly, let's me and you
go talk a little bull. Eh, heh!

277
00:21:49,804 --> 00:21:52,204
I'll hold the money.

278
00:21:54,275 --> 00:21:55,740
Let's get something straight, Wayne.

279
00:21:55,741 --> 00:21:58,712
This is my test, and I'm gonna win it
fair or I'm not gonna win it at all.

280
00:21:58,779 --> 00:22:00,974
You gonna marry Doc?
I ain't marryin' no man.

281
00:22:01,048 --> 00:22:03,949
You are if he wins.
Doc can't out cowboy me.

282
00:22:04,018 --> 00:22:07,215
I don't know, Tess.
There's somethin' different about Doc.

283
00:22:07,288 --> 00:22:09,279
Aces and eights.

284
00:22:10,858 --> 00:22:13,383
That's a dead man's hand,
isn't it... isn't it?

285
00:22:14,595 --> 00:22:17,962
Isn't it?
Yeah, it is.

286
00:22:22,036 --> 00:22:26,700
Ah! Oh!
Turn over Tess's hand.

287
00:22:26,774 --> 00:22:31,074
Forget it, Al. You were wrong.
Sam, turn over Tess's hand.

288
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:34,070
Come on!

289
00:22:36,217 --> 00:22:39,084
See, I knew it... aces and eights.

290
00:22:39,153 --> 00:22:42,281
He was cheatin'.
He dealt 'em to her so she could beat you.

291
00:22:44,425 --> 00:22:47,292
So that's how she's gonna play it.

292
00:23:03,377 --> 00:23:07,074
You oughta take some salt tablets
and some water.

293
00:23:07,148 --> 00:23:09,139
I ain't thirsty.

294
00:23:11,585 --> 00:23:13,678
No sense killin' yourself.

295
00:23:13,754 --> 00:23:16,552
You're two posts behind,
and there are only three holes left.

296
00:23:16,624 --> 00:23:20,924
- I don't need no help!
- Oh, Women's Lib is gonna love you.

297
00:23:20,995 --> 00:23:23,987
What's that?
Somethin' on the horizon,

298
00:23:24,065 --> 00:23:26,056
like that storm.

299
00:23:27,735 --> 00:23:29,965
We'll beat it. It's an hour off.

300
00:23:38,045 --> 00:23:40,036
Here.

301
00:23:40,114 --> 00:23:42,105
I ain't thirsty.

302
00:23:45,853 --> 00:23:48,014
Tess,

303
00:23:48,089 --> 00:23:50,250
you're pale,

304
00:23:50,324 --> 00:23:54,260
you're hot,
and I'll bet nauseous.

305
00:23:54,328 --> 00:23:57,695
I want you out of the sun.
I ain't no quitter.

306
00:23:57,765 --> 00:23:59,926
Look, nobody said you were.

307
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,232
It's just, there's some things that...
that a man can do better than a woman.

308
00:24:04,305 --> 00:24:07,433
There ain't nothin' that
you can do better than me.

309
00:24:07,508 --> 00:24:10,705
And there are some things that a woman can
do better than a man, like havin' babies.

310
00:24:10,778 --> 00:24:15,806
Babies? I ain't havin' no babies.

311
00:24:15,883 --> 00:24:19,546
Isn't that why you're gettin' married, so you
can have children and keep Riata in the family?

312
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,918
I ain't gettin' married.

313
00:24:21,989 --> 00:24:24,924
Well, you are if I can
keep up with you,

314
00:24:24,992 --> 00:24:27,483
and, uh, I figure that
I'm ahead on points.

315
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:33,425
Come on. Let go of me! I ain't lettin' no man...

316
00:24:33,501 --> 00:24:35,492
Whoop.

317
00:24:57,825 --> 00:25:03,229
Pard and me
Pardon me for loving you

318
00:25:09,203 --> 00:25:12,104
What is it, Doc?

319
00:25:12,173 --> 00:25:17,076
Heat exhaustion. Get me a half teaspoon of salt
in a quart of cold water, and get me a washcloth.

320
00:25:17,144 --> 00:25:19,135
All right.

321
00:25:38,933 --> 00:25:42,300
Here you go, Doc. I got the well water
and salt like y'all... Oh, Lordy!

322
00:25:42,369 --> 00:25:44,564
Pour me a glass.

323
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:49,637
She gonna be all right?
Soon as I get her cooled off...

324
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:52,440
and get some fluids in her,
she'll be fine.

325
00:25:52,513 --> 00:25:54,674
Fetch me a fan, would ya?
All right.

326
00:25:54,748 --> 00:25:57,080
"Fetch. " I'm talkin' like them.

327
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,968
I'll go get the animals.

328
00:26:17,037 --> 00:26:19,232
- Good idea.
- Yeah.

329
00:26:23,878 --> 00:26:28,247
What happened?
I mentioned babies and you fainted.

330
00:26:28,315 --> 00:26:33,651
I swooned?
Well, yeah. Uh, drink this.

331
00:26:36,423 --> 00:26:39,415
Salt water?
Just drink it, please.

332
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,788
Why'd you bring me here?

333
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:52,066
It's closer than your place. Now, just
drink a little bit more, and slowly.

334
00:26:53,807 --> 00:26:55,798
That's it.

335
00:27:02,516 --> 00:27:04,507
You... You man!

336
00:27:10,824 --> 00:27:12,815
Oh, that's smart.

337
00:27:12,893 --> 00:27:16,693
You're... You got heat prostration,
and you cover yourself up with a blanket.

338
00:27:16,764 --> 00:27:20,598
Pass out again if you want to.
I'll just take off all of your clothes.

339
00:27:24,838 --> 00:27:27,568
- Hi, Miss McGill. Feelin' any better?
- Hi, B...

340
00:27:30,377 --> 00:27:33,039
Doc, if you don't mind...
I put the animals up.

341
00:27:33,113 --> 00:27:36,344
I'd kinda like to get back.
Looks like it's gonna be a pretty big one.

342
00:27:36,417 --> 00:27:39,318
Yeah, well it's fine by me.

343
00:27:39,386 --> 00:27:42,219
Well, I better get home too.

344
00:27:42,289 --> 00:27:46,953
Yeah, you're not goin' anywhere
for at least an hour.

345
00:27:47,027 --> 00:27:49,018
You, uh...

346
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:52,021
You want...

347
00:27:53,467 --> 00:27:56,027
You want the boy to stay?

348
00:27:58,005 --> 00:28:01,406
- No.
- Y'all take care now, you hear?

349
00:28:06,579 --> 00:28:09,772
Thank you for trusting me.

350
00:28:10,851 --> 00:28:13,979
I don't trust ya, Doc. I trust me.

351
00:28:24,064 --> 00:28:27,227
What's wrong with Piggy?

352
00:28:29,336 --> 00:28:31,600
She has allergies.

353
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,731
What?

354
00:28:34,808 --> 00:28:39,438
Uh, she's allergic to something
on your ranch. She's fine here.

355
00:28:40,914 --> 00:28:43,405
Then you keep her.

356
00:28:43,484 --> 00:28:48,217
Well, thank you, Tess.
That's, uh... That's mighty nice.

357
00:28:49,657 --> 00:28:53,787
Just payment for the doctorin' and
the loan of the clothes, that's all.

358
00:28:55,929 --> 00:28:58,955
Shh, shh, shh. Easy.

359
00:28:59,033 --> 00:29:01,866
Easy, Piggy.
That ol' thunder can't hurt you.

360
00:29:03,404 --> 00:29:06,202
She can't understand you.

361
00:29:06,273 --> 00:29:09,765
I'm just usin' my voice to...
soothe her.

362
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:19,482
Thunder scares me.

363
00:29:19,553 --> 00:29:24,456
Always has, always will.
I guess I'm no smarter than Piggy.

364
00:29:24,525 --> 00:29:28,017
There's no sin in bein' afraid.
It is in Texas.

365
00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:34,927
Well, I think the worst is over.

366
00:29:37,638 --> 00:29:40,766
You wanna dance?

367
00:29:40,841 --> 00:29:42,866
What?

368
00:29:42,943 --> 00:29:45,002
Dance.

369
00:29:50,616 --> 00:29:52,416
I don't dance.

370
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,260
No!

371
00:30:37,131 --> 00:30:37,849
What did I do?

372
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:39,463
It's not what you did.
It's what you're gonna do.

373
00:30:39,533 --> 00:30:41,467
I ain't gonna lose in here
what I won out there.

374
00:30:41,535 --> 00:30:44,561
I didn't think dancing
was part of the contest.

375
00:30:44,638 --> 00:30:46,037
Everything's part of the contest, Doc,

376
00:30:46,038 --> 00:30:49,166
and so far you ain't been able to keep up
with me at anything except posthole diggin'!

377
00:30:49,243 --> 00:30:53,236
And poker.
I figure I'm ahead in poker.

378
00:30:59,853 --> 00:31:02,117
I didn't know Wayne
was gonna do that.

379
00:31:06,493 --> 00:31:09,018
I'm-I'm glad you weren't in on it.

380
00:31:12,366 --> 00:31:15,699
So...
So...

381
00:31:15,769 --> 00:31:20,502
Uh, the way I see it, I bested you
in ropin', wranglin' and drinkin',

382
00:31:20,574 --> 00:31:23,407
and you got a leg up on me...

383
00:31:23,477 --> 00:31:27,846
in poker, posthole diggin'
and dancin'.

384
00:31:27,915 --> 00:31:32,318
Sounds like a tie to me. Contest
wasn't to tie me. It was to beat me.

385
00:31:32,386 --> 00:31:34,684
Well, I still have tomorrow.
Tomorrow's Sunday,

386
00:31:34,755 --> 00:31:39,920
and, unless you intend to out pray me,
you just lost, Doc.

387
00:31:39,993 --> 00:31:42,154
Look, Tess.

388
00:31:42,229 --> 00:31:44,356
Come on.
You owe me a tiebreaker.

389
00:31:48,368 --> 00:31:51,701
Okay. One last test.

390
00:31:51,772 --> 00:31:56,607
Shoot.
You want to marry me, Doc?

391
00:31:56,677 --> 00:31:58,668
Ride Widowmaker.

392
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:05,541
That's what I thought.

393
00:32:33,347 --> 00:32:36,248
I like you, too, Piggy. Yeah.

394
00:32:38,252 --> 00:32:40,243
Funny thing is...

395
00:32:41,355 --> 00:32:45,189
Till we danced, I didn't realize
how much I liked her.

396
00:33:10,651 --> 00:33:12,642
Tess!

397
00:33:16,757 --> 00:33:19,225
I'm comin', Chance.
The Lord has waited all week for...

398
00:33:19,293 --> 00:33:22,990
Ain't that Doc
and Widowmaker down there?

399
00:33:25,632 --> 00:33:28,692
Al, Widowmaker.

400
00:33:28,769 --> 00:33:30,760
Oh, hello, Widowmaker.

401
00:33:31,805 --> 00:33:36,936
Do you know where she and that
jockstrap breath went over the weekend?

402
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:41,674
To Vegas. Can you believe it? Our Vegas. Al.

403
00:33:41,748 --> 00:33:46,151
If that Tina came to me on her knees...
on her knees and begged me,

404
00:33:46,219 --> 00:33:49,416
I wouldn't give her the sweat off of my... Al.

405
00:33:50,891 --> 00:33:53,291
Oh, uh, you want me
to control the horse.

406
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,794
Please.

407
00:33:55,862 --> 00:33:58,626
- Hey, Doc, you crazy?
- Ask Tess.

408
00:33:58,699 --> 00:34:03,159
He's gonna get himself killed.
Is this here part of the contest?

409
00:34:03,236 --> 00:34:05,431
This is the contest.

410
00:34:05,505 --> 00:34:08,303
Come on, boys!
He's gonna try her again!

411
00:34:08,375 --> 00:34:11,606
Ohhmmm.

412
00:34:11,678 --> 00:34:14,238
- You ready? Al?
- Ohhmmm.

413
00:34:14,314 --> 00:34:16,475
- Al?
- Yeah, yeah. Get on. Go ahead.

414
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:19,644
Ohhmmm.

415
00:34:25,425 --> 00:34:27,723
Ohhmmm... What?

416
00:34:27,794 --> 00:34:32,561
No, I'm busy right now.
Ohhmmm.

417
00:34:32,632 --> 00:34:35,624
- No, I can't come to the phone right now.
- Al.

418
00:34:35,702 --> 00:34:38,569
Ohhmmm... Who is it?

419
00:34:39,539 --> 00:34:41,700
Tina? Uh, um...

420
00:34:41,775 --> 00:34:46,007
Uh, just... just stay right there
for a while, uh, Sam.

421
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,877
I'll be right back, huh?
Yeah. Just...

422
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:50,940
Just...

423
00:34:54,421 --> 00:34:55,945
Yee-aa-aah!

424
00:35:01,328 --> 00:35:03,228
Ride him, Doc!

425
00:35:04,264 --> 00:35:07,062
- Come on.
- Come on, Doc.

426
00:35:08,068 --> 00:35:09,592
Come on, Doc.
Come on, Doc.

427
00:35:11,905 --> 00:35:14,533
Come on, Doc!
Ride him!

428
00:35:15,842 --> 00:35:19,209
- Ride him, Doc!
- Come on, Doc!

429
00:35:33,293 --> 00:35:36,524
- God dang!
- All right. I seen some ridin' out there.

430
00:35:36,596 --> 00:35:39,258
Good ride, Doc.

431
00:35:39,332 --> 00:35:42,733
Good ride. You know, I think
Widowmaker could use a new name.

432
00:35:42,803 --> 00:35:46,899
- Welcome to the family, son.
- Thanks, but no thanks. I just, uh...

433
00:35:46,973 --> 00:35:51,137
I wanted to see if I could ride him,
not her.

434
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:12,757
Oh, now, now, daughter.

435
00:36:12,833 --> 00:36:15,734
I guess the laugh's on me.
Nobody's laughin', Tess.

436
00:36:15,802 --> 00:36:18,032
They better not.

437
00:36:18,105 --> 00:36:20,767
Go after him.

438
00:36:20,841 --> 00:36:22,832
Chase a man?

439
00:36:22,909 --> 00:36:28,108
A calf has to be roped before you can
put your brand on him. Why not a man?

440
00:36:28,181 --> 00:36:30,172
It'd be humiliating.

441
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:33,777
Any more than what you've
been doin' to Doc this past week?

442
00:36:33,854 --> 00:36:38,416
Tess, for once in your life, act
like a woman instead of a cowboy.

443
00:36:38,492 --> 00:36:40,790
Hmm?

444
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:46,024
You gotta trust me, Doc.

445
00:36:46,099 --> 00:36:49,296
I'm doin' what I think is best.

446
00:36:49,369 --> 00:36:52,566
Winning a contest isn't enough.
I mean, she's gotta want...

447
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:54,971
You always talk to yourself,
Doc?

448
00:36:55,976 --> 00:36:58,035
You always...

449
00:36:58,111 --> 00:37:01,274
come into a man's house
without knocking?

450
00:37:01,348 --> 00:37:03,441
Sorry.

451
00:37:03,517 --> 00:37:05,985
You oughta wear a dress more often.

452
00:37:06,052 --> 00:37:08,145
Kinda hard to work a ranch
wearin' a dress.

453
00:37:08,221 --> 00:37:11,088
- Don't you ever back off?
- Can't afford to.

454
00:37:11,158 --> 00:37:15,710
Oh, yeah, I forgot. You're a Texan, and
Texans gotta be tougher than rawhide.

455
00:37:15,711 --> 00:37:16,994
What do you want, Tess?

456
00:37:17,063 --> 00:37:20,499
Well, I was just wonderin'...

457
00:37:20,567 --> 00:37:25,163
... why you risked your life
for 50,000 acres of prime Texas land...

458
00:37:25,238 --> 00:37:26,449
and then turned it down.

459
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:29,072
Is that what you think this
is about? Getting Riata?

460
00:37:29,142 --> 00:37:33,511
- Well, it sure as hell ain't about love.
- You speakin' for me or for yourself?

461
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:41,486
Doc, in all the years
we've known each other,

462
00:37:41,555 --> 00:37:44,991
the only thing we ever talked
about was sick critters.

463
00:37:47,827 --> 00:37:52,389
- Okay, uh, how about those Dodgers?
- What?

464
00:37:52,465 --> 00:37:57,903
Look, Tess, it's hard to talk to you
about anything except Riata.

465
00:37:57,971 --> 00:38:03,204
Especially if, uh...
I mean, if a fella's shy.

466
00:38:03,276 --> 00:38:06,473
You never struck me as bein' shy. Well, I was.

467
00:38:06,546 --> 00:38:09,481
At least I was when
it came to expressing...

468
00:38:10,483 --> 00:38:12,713
my feelings for you.

469
00:38:14,854 --> 00:38:16,845
So, uh,

470
00:38:18,692 --> 00:38:20,853
I wrote 'em all down.

471
00:38:54,094 --> 00:38:56,392
This isn't fair, you know.

472
00:38:56,463 --> 00:38:59,523
You can't expect me to do this
and not get involved.

473
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,500
So if Tess falls in love with Doc,

474
00:39:02,569 --> 00:39:06,938
I'd appreciate it if you'd just
leap me outta here as soon as possible.

475
00:39:12,479 --> 00:39:14,470
Doc.

476
00:39:16,082 --> 00:39:19,381
Can we dance?

477
00:39:19,452 --> 00:39:21,443
Sure.

478
00:39:37,737 --> 00:39:43,232
Doc, Riata's in my blood.
I just can't give her up.

479
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:45,505
Nobody's askin' you to.

480
00:39:45,578 --> 00:39:50,140
But if I marry you, then all the men'll
look to you after Chance is gone.

481
00:39:51,685 --> 00:39:53,846
Couldn't we run it together?

482
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,551
Together?

483
00:40:03,563 --> 00:40:05,554
Together.

484
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:24,113
<i>Tess! Tess McGill!</i>

485
00:40:24,184 --> 00:40:27,051
<i>I know you're in there. !</i>

486
00:40:27,754 --> 00:40:30,518
Wayne, what're you doin' here?

487
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:33,184
I wanna know if you're marryin' Doc.

488
00:40:33,259 --> 00:40:36,558
Well, that's none
of your damn business.

489
00:40:36,629 --> 00:40:39,154
Now, Tess, I figure it is.

490
00:40:40,166 --> 00:40:43,363
I ain't been bustin' my butt for you all
these years to have you go run off with Doc.

491
00:40:43,436 --> 00:40:45,904
You were paid for every day you worked,
and plenty you didn't.

492
00:40:45,972 --> 00:40:49,772
Do you think I worked at Riata for
three squares and 50 bucks a month?

493
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:57,379
I ain't some bowlegged cowboy
like Eddie or Zeke.

494
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:01,511
I... I was hopin' some day to rope you.

495
00:41:01,588 --> 00:41:04,421
- You mean Riata.
- You can keep Riata.

496
00:41:07,994 --> 00:41:10,462
I want you.

497
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:12,521
What?

498
00:41:19,806 --> 00:41:22,070
I love you, Tess.

499
00:41:22,142 --> 00:41:24,542
I have ever since
the first day I rode in.

500
00:41:24,611 --> 00:41:26,602
Just...

501
00:41:29,215 --> 00:41:31,843
Just never had the guts to say so.

502
00:41:34,187 --> 00:41:36,815
But I wrote these letters.

503
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,941
Would you mind
if I danced with Wayne...

504
00:42:06,419 --> 00:42:08,819
just to see how it feels?

505
00:42:11,591 --> 00:42:14,958
Uh...
No. Sure.

506
00:42:19,532 --> 00:42:21,523
Uh...

507
00:42:24,604 --> 00:42:27,971
I don't know how to dance, Tess.

508
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:31,670
That's okay. I'll lead.

509
00:42:43,056 --> 00:42:45,752
<i>Wayne danced about as well as I did... </i>

510
00:42:45,825 --> 00:42:50,159
<i>with Miss Morgan</i>
<i>at my kindergarten graduation. </i>

511
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:55,361
<i>She married the principal that summer, and I
didn't get over it until I met Miss Sedlack. </i>

512
00:42:55,435 --> 00:42:59,633
<i>She was my first-grade teacher. </i>

513
00:42:59,706 --> 00:43:03,164
<i>I hoped getting over Tess</i>
<i>wouldn't take as long. </i>

514
00:43:07,113 --> 00:43:09,581
At least you're still my girl.

515
00:43:09,649 --> 00:43:12,243
Oop.

516
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:14,309
That's it.

517
00:43:18,391 --> 00:43:21,155
- Fickle.
- You're lookin'pretty sharp, Sam.

518
00:43:24,464 --> 00:43:28,230
Oh, hello. I love those silver tips
on your boots. Those are nice.

519
00:43:28,301 --> 00:43:33,500
And, oh, you've got matching ones
on your collar. Ha-ha! "Trés" western.

520
00:43:33,573 --> 00:43:37,600
Oh, come on, Sam. Gimme a break.
I knew you could ride that nag.

521
00:43:37,677 --> 00:43:43,616
Nag? You call that half ton of Texas
lightning that tried to castrate me a nag?

522
00:43:43,683 --> 00:43:46,243
Yeah, but he didn't.
You rode him, cowboy!

523
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,787
Oh, gee, shucks, Mr. Dillon.

524
00:43:48,855 --> 00:43:53,053
Sam, if I hadn't taken that phone call,
I would have lost Tina forever.

525
00:43:53,126 --> 00:43:55,117
She's back?
Yeah.

526
00:43:55,194 --> 00:43:59,824
She gave Gooshie a case
of mouthwash and sent him packing.

527
00:43:59,899 --> 00:44:02,697
She only did it
to make me jealous.

528
00:44:02,769 --> 00:44:06,364
And-And she never slept
with that rotten bum.

529
00:44:09,776 --> 00:44:12,574
I believe her.
You believed Ziggy.

530
00:44:12,645 --> 00:44:15,341
Well, technically Ziggy wasn't wrong.

531
00:44:15,415 --> 00:44:19,476
He said he predicted Tess would marry
someone who wrote her love letters.

532
00:44:19,552 --> 00:44:21,713
You're right, Al.
Yeah. Of course.

533
00:44:21,788 --> 00:44:23,949
I can't blame Ziggy.
No.

534
00:44:24,023 --> 00:44:26,958
I mean, you were the one who said
I had to marry her to leap. Me?

535
00:44:27,026 --> 00:44:30,154
Yeah, you.
I don't know that I ever said that.

536
00:44:30,229 --> 00:44:34,393
I do. Well, I, uh... You know,
I never really believed it.

537
00:44:34,467 --> 00:44:37,459
You didn't, huh?
Did you?

538
00:44:38,705 --> 00:44:41,037
Come here. Come here.

539
00:44:41,107 --> 00:44:43,098
What?
Look in here.

540
00:44:46,579 --> 00:44:48,570
Check it out.

541
00:44:49,649 --> 00:44:51,640
Go on.

542
00:44:56,789 --> 00:44:59,849
You had a lot to overcome, Sam.

543
00:45:03,796 --> 00:45:05,787
Hi, Doc.

544
00:45:14,474 --> 00:45:16,635
Could you just once use the door?

545
00:45:22,382 --> 00:45:24,373
Happy?
Thank you.

546
00:45:26,753 --> 00:45:30,018
Best man's lookin'real sharp.
Sharp indeed.

547
00:45:30,089 --> 00:45:32,819
Thanks, son.

548
00:45:33,993 --> 00:45:37,690
Uh, Tess getting married might still
be your ticket out of here.

549
00:45:37,764 --> 00:45:39,994
Ziggy's sayin' there's
a 50-50 chance...

550
00:45:40,066 --> 00:45:43,900
that you'll leap the minute
she says, "I do. " Ziggy.

551
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:45,961
Uh, you seen Piggy?

552
00:45:46,039 --> 00:45:48,834
She's around here someplace.
You want me to go find her?

553
00:45:48,835 --> 00:45:50,305
No, that's okay. I'll look.

554
00:45:50,376 --> 00:45:52,367
Piggy?

555
00:45:53,846 --> 00:45:55,837
Piggy.

556
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:00,082
<i>Piggy</i>

557
00:46:01,087 --> 00:46:03,521
Here, Piggy. Souee!

558
00:46:03,589 --> 00:46:05,682
<i>Piggy souee</i>

559
00:46:05,758 --> 00:46:08,625
Piggy. Piggy souee.

560
00:46:08,695 --> 00:46:11,163
<i>Piggy souee, piggy souee</i>

561
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:14,199
<i>Oh, how my heart yearns for you</i>

562
00:46:14,267 --> 00:46:16,462
<i>Oh, Piggy</i>

563
00:46:16,536 --> 00:46:18,629
<i>My Piggy souee</i>

564
00:46:19,972 --> 00:46:24,170
<i>Well, I love you, gal
and I need you, Piggy, souee</i>

565
00:46:24,243 --> 00:46:28,543
Why don't you go ahead and try it? Buddy.

566
00:46:28,614 --> 00:46:31,174
Yeah, Doc?

567
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:36,119
Uh, why don't you try "Peggy Sue"?
It might sound a little better.

568
00:46:36,189 --> 00:46:38,180
All right.

569
00:46:43,062 --> 00:46:45,963
<i>Peggy Sue, Peggy Sue</i>

570
00:46:46,032 --> 00:46:48,466
<i>Oh, how my heart yearns for you</i>

571
00:46:48,534 --> 00:46:50,661
<i>Oh, oh, Peggy</i>

572
00:46:50,737 --> 00:46:54,468
<i>My Peggy Sue</i>

00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:58,977

574
00:47:00,646 --> 00:47:03,843
<i>Oh, I need you, Peggy Sue</i>

575
00:47:03,916 --> 00:47:06,407
<i>With a love that's rare and true</i>

576
00:47:06,486 --> 00:47:10,718
<i>Oh, Peggy, my Peggy Sue</i>

577
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:12,781
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

578
00:47:12,859 --> 00:47:16,761
<i>Well, I love you, gal</i>
<i>and I need you, Peggy Sue</i>

579
00:47:18,965 --> 00:47:21,661
Thanks, Frankie. You was terrific.

580
00:47:21,734 --> 00:47:24,635
If I'm lyin', I'm dyin'.
