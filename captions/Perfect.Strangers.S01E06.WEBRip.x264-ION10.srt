Why don't they call?

20
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,238
Said they'd call.

21
00:01:44,305 --> 00:01:47,308
I'll tell you why, 'cause
nobody ever returns your calls.

22
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,446
What are you doing?
Making a phone call.

23
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:55,283
Balki, use the phone,
I'll break a bone.

24
00:01:56,684 --> 00:02:01,155
Boy, somebody got up
on the wrong side of the flock.

25
00:02:01,222 --> 00:02:04,625
What the matter with you is?
Nothing the matter with me is.

26
00:02:04,692 --> 00:02:07,761
Everything's fine.
Just a little tense.

27
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:09,897
Anxious. Upset. Irritable.

28
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:13,367
And I certainly didn't get up
on the wrong side of the flock.

29
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:15,102
Hello, Ri...

30
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:17,905
Hello, Ritz...
Hello, Ritz Discount.

31
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:21,442
Yes, this is Larry Appleton.

32
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:24,712
You're kidding.
Great! I'll be there!

33
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:27,381
This may be
the greatest day of my life.

34
00:02:27,448 --> 00:02:31,519
Now you happy
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hekyll?

35
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:37,591
Balki, that was the photo editor
from the Chicago Weekly Gazette.

36
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,260
Remember that picture
I submitted yesterday

37
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:43,664
of the burning building?

38
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:47,335
I've got to be there at six
to sign a release and get paid.

39
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:49,970
Balki, this is my first sale.
Oh, cousin.

40
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:52,406
You are
a professional
picture taker.

41
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:54,242
It's your dream come true.

42
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:57,211
Now we are so happy.
We do the Dance of Joy.

43
00:02:57,278 --> 00:02:59,947
Balki...

44
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,850
A photo journalist must
maintain a modicum of dignity.

45
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:05,819
Let's boogie.

46

♪ Hi hi hi hi ♪

47
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:19,132
I can't believe it.

48
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,134
This is
a terrific birthday present.

49
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,136
Today is your birthday?
Yeah.

50
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,473
Happy birthday.
Thank you.

51
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:28,609
What did you get me?
Well, I...

52
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:31,044
What do you mean,
what did I get you?

53
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:32,446
I'm supposed to get presents.

54
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:35,015
You're supposed to get
the presents?

55
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:37,017
You get presents
on your birthday?

56
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:39,320
Well, of course. That's
an American birthday tradition.

57
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:41,555
Haven't you ever heard of that?

58
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:44,858
Of course I have.
Don't be ridiculous.

59
00:03:46,327 --> 00:03:49,563
I suppose this means
you also didn't bake me a cake?

60
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:52,833
What can I say?
I'm scum.

61
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:58,105
Well, it's all right.

62
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,474
Why you didn't tell me
it's our birthday?

63
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,142
I don't know,
I guess, I just

64
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:04,345
wasn't in the mood
to celebrate this year.

65
00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:08,048
But things are looking up.
"Photo by Larry Appleton."

66
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:09,950
Well, look here.

67
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:13,921
If it isn't Tweedledum
and Tweedledumber.

68
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:19,993
Mr. Twinkacetti, good news.
Cousin Larry sold a photograph.

69
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,029
It his dream come true.

70
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:27,468
Wise up, Appleton.

71
00:04:27,535 --> 00:04:30,371
right here, until you die.

72
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,007
Grim, isn't it?

73
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:39,613
Not even Twinkacetti
can spoil this.

74
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,082
Well, I'd better leave.
Well, you got one hour.

75
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:44,718
Well, Balki,
what if there's a traffic jam?

76
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,754
What if the elevator
gets stuck between floors?

77
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,589
What if
the building burns down?

78
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:50,791
What if
a giant prehistoric monster

79
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:54,562
crawls out of Lake Michigan
and eats Chicago?

80
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:57,130
You're right.
I'd better get a move on.

81
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:59,733
Hi, Larry.
Sorry, no time. Gotta run.

82
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:04,572
I sold a picture.
That's great. Fabulous.

83
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:07,941
Hi, Susan, Tina.
Hi.

84
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:12,179
He's excited.
He should be.

85
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,415
Let's throw him
a surprise birthday party.

86
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:17,651
Oh, good idea. When?
Don't tell me.

87
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:21,789
I want it to be a surprise.

88
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,167
Okay, we put all the food there,
and we put the balloons here.

89
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:36,437
And what this?

90
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:43,043
Isn't that something?
Only in America.

91
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:48,849
You know, in Mypos to do that,
we had to squeeze a frog.

92
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:54,688
It's Larry.
Oh, he's early.

93
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,724
What do we do?
Okay, okay.

94
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,759
You go downstairs
and head everybody off.

95
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:00,994
I'll hide the party stuff,
and that way

96
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:03,631
we all surprise him
at the same moment.

97
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,514
Cousin, how did it go
at the newspaper?

98
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:22,716
Oh, fine. Everything's fine.

99
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:25,152
They like me.
They love my photograph.

100
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:28,288
Oh, it went great.
Everything's fine.

101
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:30,958
Fine, fine, fine.

102
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,029
I sense you have left out
some small but important detail.

103
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:38,198
Oh, yeah,
did I forget to mention

104
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:41,068
that the jerks didn't want
to buy my photograph after all?

105
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:43,270
Oh, cousin, that's terrible.
Why not?

106
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,639
Well, at the last minute,

107
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:50,711
they decided to use a
picture taken by some other guy.

108
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:52,980
Oh.
And get this.

109
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:55,282
The guy just happens
to live next door

110
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,350
to the publisher's barber.

111
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,052
Talk about your nepotism.

112
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,591
Well, I'd love
to talk about my nepotism

113
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:06,193
but I don't know what that is.

114
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,967
A baby being rescued
from the burning building.

115
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:16,737
News value.

116
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:19,072
The baby wasn't even that cute.

117
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,010
Oh, cousin, you must be
so disappointed.

118
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:26,514
Well, another birthday,
another banner year of failure

119
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,316
with a capital F
for Larry Appleton.

120
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:32,720
Well, that's it. No more.
Me, a photojournalist.

121
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:42,996
Cousin, you just
didn't sell one picture.

122
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:45,699
No, it's not
just the one picture.

123
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:48,101
Don't you see
the significance of this?

124
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:51,238
I may as well throw my master
plan right out the window.

125
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,407
No, no, you don't
throw your master plan

126
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,009
right out the window.

127
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:01,715
What is a master plan?

128
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:04,217
Don't they have anything
on Mypos besides sheep?

129
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:07,955
Well, we got a 7-11.

130
00:08:29,777 --> 00:08:32,846
See, my master plan
is a schedule

131
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:36,083
of how I want achieve
my goal in life.

132
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:39,653
Oh, and at 24, you're supposed
to sell a photograph.

133
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,189
At 24, I was supposed
to win a Pulitzer Prize.

134
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:45,458
I was supposed to sell
my first photograph
when I was 16.

135
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,160
Well, cousin, call me cuckoo

136
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:49,396
but instead
of giving up on life

137
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:52,766
why you don't just change your
plan? Give yourself more time.

138
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:57,771
Oh, sure, sure.

139
00:08:57,838 --> 00:08:59,640
Before you know it,
I'm an 80-year-old

140
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:01,975
aspiring photojournalist.

141
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:06,814
Well, I guess
the way you feel.

142
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,016
What would make you
feel a little better

143
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:12,620
would be to have
a nice dinner with
some friends, or maybe...

144
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:16,123
...a party?

145
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:18,258
A party

146
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:20,928
I don't even want to hear
the word birthday.

147
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:29,269
"Hey, how's it going, Larry?

148
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:31,338
That's all I need.

149
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,307
Thank God I didn't tell
anyone else it's my birthday.

150
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,650
This could get ugly.

151
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,829
I'll get it.
No, no, cousin.

152
00:09:57,297 --> 00:10:00,000
I'll take care of this.
Go away.

153
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:06,106
Took care of that.

154
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,979
Cousin, you look miserable.
Why don't you go lie down?

155
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:14,614
Well, I might as well
get some sleep now.

156
00:10:14,682 --> 00:10:25,358
Just hope my tears don't

157
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:27,360
I can't sleep.

158
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:29,462
I'm hungry.

159
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:32,032
Well, what about some peanuts?

160
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:36,069
Thanks.

161
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:40,407
Why have you got
peanuts in that pocket?

162
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:50,984
Why did I ask?

163
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:53,721
Cousin.
Hmm?

164
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:55,889
Cousin, cousin, don't do that.

165
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:58,658
I'm just gonna
hang up my coat.

166
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,898
No, no,
you can't come in.

167
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:06,533
Balki, you invited us,
remember?

168
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,769
I've got Cousin Larry
locked in the closet.

169
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:10,804
There's no party.
I made a big mistake.

170
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:12,205
Stupid Balki. Now, go away.

171
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:30,824
Don't you ever
ever do that again.

172
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,227
Do what?

173
00:11:36,764 --> 00:11:39,733
You locked me
in the closet.

174
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,372
No, I didn't.

175
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:49,042
What do you mean, you didn't?

176
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:52,712
You shoved me in the closet
and you locked the door.

177
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,848
No way.

178
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,385
Uh-uh.

179
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:01,321
What do you mean, no way?
I am not crazy.

180
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,056
Well, you got--

181
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:08,195
I suppose you're gonna tell me
there was no one at the door.

182
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:11,231
What door?
That door! That closet!

183
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,803
I don't know
what you're talking about.

184
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:20,507
Okay, okay.

185
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,242
We're not having this
conversation.

186
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:25,278
This whole day has been part
of some cosmic cruelty joke.

187
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:28,181
Ha ha! Fine. Oh!

188
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:32,886
If Tony Perkins shows up
wearing a house dress

189
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:35,588
and carrying a very large
kitchen knife,

190
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:38,191
tell him I'm in the shower.

191
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:48,135
Hello?

192
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:50,770
Oh, you want to wish him
a happy birthday?

193
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:53,140
Well, you don't
want to do that.

194
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,476
Why? He can't talk to you.

195
00:12:56,543 --> 00:13:00,047
Why? Because he lost
his voice, and that's that.

196
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:06,954
Oh.

197
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,890
Cousin Larry, come over here.

198
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:15,262
Here he is. Go ahead.

199
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:20,400
Are you done?

200
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,435
Well, I don't know
what you said, honey

201
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:25,672
but he's wearing
a big happy face.

202
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,374
Yes, he is and I just--

203
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,477
All the best.

204
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,779
of my entire miserable life.

205
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:38,351
You ordered a birthday cake?
Oh, please. Party's over.

206
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:41,889
Oh, hey, hey, hey.
You paid for it, you take it.

207
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:46,994
Of course.

208
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,363
No hot water.
Why should I expect hot water?

209
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,833
I should've gone
into motel management.

210
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:56,636
Or nut farming
with my Uncle Leo.

211
00:13:56,703 --> 00:14:00,840
No, no. I wanted to be a
professional photojournalist.

212
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:04,344
Professional loser.

213
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:07,580
Well, I'll tell you,
it's time for action.

214
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:10,984
Where are the want ads?

215
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:14,154
It's time I faced reality.

216
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:18,926
You know, this is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

217
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,067
I like that shirt.

218
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:36,676
LARRY:
This is typical.
This is so typical.

219
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:40,547
I am suffering a personal crisis
of major proportion,

220
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:43,483
and you are off in dreamland
with a stuffed sheep.

221
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:47,387
Balki. Balki. Balki.

222
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:01,168
Nightmare?

223
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:07,374
Don't do that.

224
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,143
Balki, how can you sleep
at a time like this?

225
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,412
It's 2 a.m.

226
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:15,748
I've spent five hours
coming to a realization.

227
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:17,450
I'm a failure.

228
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:19,652
The only job
I'm actually qualified for

229
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:21,454
is clerk in a discount store.

230
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:24,457
Well, good news,
you got that job already.

231
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:30,363
Have you noticed the time?
Yes, I've noticed the time.

232
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,633
I'm 24. Time ran out
at midnight.

233
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:39,472
Oh, cousin, you're being
too hard on yourself.

234
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:41,541
I'm a loser in life.

235
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,943
And the proof is
that nobody even bothered

236
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:46,346
to acknowledge my birthday.

237
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:53,653
But you said

238
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,990
you don't want anyone
to even say birthday.

239
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:59,359
Sure, I said it.
I didn't mean it.

240
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:05,365
Yes, you did.
No, I didn't.

241
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:09,469
Well, you fooled me, buddy.

242
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:12,539
No one acknowledged my birthday.
Not Tina, not Susan.

243
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:16,743
Not even my mom. I thought
at least my mom liked me.

244
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,246
Even you, my best friend,

245
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:22,115
didn't go to the trouble
of getting a card to say

246
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:23,616
"Happy Birthday, Cousin Larry.

247
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:26,453
"You may be a failure
in every area of your life

248
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,321
but at least
you have one friend."

249
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:32,492
No, cousin. Wait a minu--
Balki, too little too late.

250
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:37,130
Doesn't matter now.
My birthday's over.

251
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:39,532
Did anybody notice? No.

252
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:48,875
Balki, do you...

253
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:55,682
Do you think that

254
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,284
Thanks.

255
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,588
I'm pathetic.

256
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,382
Balki?

257
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,654
Balki, is that you?

258
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,823
ALL:
Surprise!

259
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:43,163
Surprise, what?

260
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,965
No, it's
a surprise birthday party.

261
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:48,701
Happy birthday!

262
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:53,005
But it-it's three in the
morning. I-I don't believe it.

263
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:57,076
Oh, you really. Ha ha.
You... You shouldn't have...

264
00:17:58,345 --> 00:18:00,547
Who are you people?

265
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:05,818
This is Max from the newsstand
near the bus stop.

266
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:09,456
Can't stay long, pal.

267
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:12,525
Well, glad you
could make it, Max.

268
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,927
This is Officer Finley.
Yo!

269
00:18:14,994 --> 00:18:16,529
Hi.

270
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,898
And this is Sandra
from the doughnut shop.

271
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:20,733
Oh, hi. Hi.

272
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,636
Could you folks excuse us
for just a minute?

273
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:30,310
Well, I invite them
to your birthday party.

274
00:18:30,377 --> 00:18:33,680
Now, tell me the truth.
Are you really surprised?

275
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:38,751
Stunned.

276
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:42,389
You were so sad. Then, I decide
to call up all of our friends

277
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:43,856
and invite them to your party.

278
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:47,126
At 3 a.m.?
That's what they said.

279
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:54,267
because it's not
a party if nobody comes.

280
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:57,670
Now you go mix and mangle.
Hey.

281
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:05,678
Thanks.
Who is that?

282
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:08,881
Well, I think it must
be a friend of Lou's.

283
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:11,150
Who's Lou?
Hey.

284
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:14,321
Happy birthday, guy.

285
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:16,689
Thank you. Lou?
Snake.

286
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,792
Snake.
Yeah.

287
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:23,696
I was over at the doughnut shop
and what's-his-name came in.

288
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:27,734
Hey, you are one lucky dude
to have him as your friend.

289
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,403
Well, not a day goes by,
I don't ask myself

290
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,705
what I did to deserve him.

291
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:37,310
You don't mean that.
Oh, yes, I do.

292
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,913
It's your birthday, isn't it?

293
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,715
Yes.
Lou told me.

294
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:46,553
Here you go. Open it up.
You gonna open it?

295
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:47,854
Come on.
Open it up.

296
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,291
Oh, no, no, this is,
this is really...

297
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,695
Oh, crullers.

298
00:19:57,764 --> 00:20:00,467
Crullers. How did you know?
I didn't.

299
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,336
It's just one of those
gifts that can't miss.

300
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:06,873
Why don't you
make a speech, cousin?

301
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,241
Yeah. I want a speech.

302
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:09,909
Speech.
Yeah, go ahead.

303
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:12,011
Go ahead, say something.

304
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:14,281
Who are you?
I'm Lou.

305
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:17,250
Oh, you're Lou.

306
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:20,219
Well, I have heard
so much about you.

307
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:22,755
Speech. Speech.
Speech.

308
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:26,293
Well, I-I hardly
know what to say.

309
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:29,696
Well, I'm just touched

310
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:33,466
and moved that you all
went to all this trouble.

311
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:37,804
Max, Snake...Sandra.

312
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,372
Wh... What can I say?

313
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:42,475
Everybody,
you're... You're the best.

314
00:20:44,377 --> 00:20:47,246
And I just want
you to know that it's...

315
00:20:47,314 --> 00:20:49,416
It's times like this

316
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:51,951
that a man realizes
who his friends are.

317
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:56,823
So I just wanna
say thank you,

318
00:20:56,889 --> 00:21:00,259
and I'll never forget this
birthday as long as I live.

319
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:03,530
Hear, hear.

320
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,798
Excuse me, sir.
Me and Lou, we gotta run.

321
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:08,535
I'm sorry.
You're sorry?

322
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:12,439
Bye-bye. Happy birthday.
Bye.

323
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,709
Okay, everybody,
start singing.

324
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,446

325

All right, here we go.

331
00:21:50,677 --> 00:21:53,145
You know, Balki,
believe it or not,

332
00:21:53,212 --> 00:21:55,815
that was one of the best
birthdays I've ever had.

333
00:21:55,882 --> 00:21:58,451
Aw. Now you see
you're not a failure

334
00:21:58,518 --> 00:22:00,787
because you have friends.

335
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:02,389
Thank you, Balki.

336
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:05,692
That was one of the nicest
things anybody's done for me.

337
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:10,397
Cousin, I throw it together
at the last minute...

338
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,500
...twice.

339
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:18,004
You know, I learned
something else tonight.

340
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:21,207
I can't give up my dream
of becoming a photojournalist.

341
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:22,709
Why not?

342
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,449
But who was it that said

343
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:31,951
"You can't set
your watch by a dream.

344
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:34,353
"They operate on schedules
all their own."

345
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:37,356
I said that.

346
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,661
I wrote on your birthday card.

347
00:22:41,728 --> 00:22:44,931
I knew it was
somebody important.

348
00:22:44,997 --> 00:22:50,537
Thanks, Balki.

349
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:53,706
Well, cousin,
that's what friends do.

350
00:22:56,776 --> 00:22:59,111
Goodnight.
Goodnight.

351
00:23:07,654 --> 00:23:10,389
I think we're out of ice.
