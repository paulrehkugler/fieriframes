1
00:03:15,366 --> 00:03:17,360
Gone fishing.

2
00:03:42,112 --> 00:03:46,277
The lonesome foghorn blows.

3
00:04:39,275 --> 00:04:41,068
Oh, dear.

4
00:04:43,406 --> 00:04:47,157
Lucy, this is Pete Martell.

5
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,826
Lucy, put Harry on the horn.

6
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:53,162
Sheriff, it's Pete
Martell up at the mill.

7
00:04:53,295 --> 00:04:57,045
I'm going to transfer it to the
phone on the table by the red chair.

8
00:04:57,176 --> 00:04:59,383
The red chair against the wall.

9
00:04:59,512 --> 00:05:04,888
The little table with the lamp on
it, the lamp we moved from the corner.

10
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:08,766
The black phone, not the brown phone.

11
00:05:13,365 --> 00:05:17,032
- Morning, Pete. Harry.
- She's dead.

12
00:05:18,038 --> 00:05:19,948
Wrapped in plastic.

13
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,575
Hold on a second, Pete.

14
00:05:24,046 --> 00:05:26,124
Where?

15
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,553
You stay right there. I'm on my way.

16
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:40,524
Better get Dr Hayward. Tell him
to meet up at the Packard mill.

17
00:05:40,654 --> 00:05:43,905
Roust Andy out of bed. Tell
him to get up there now.

18
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:46,869
- What is it?
- We've got a body up there.

19
00:05:47,162 --> 00:05:51,577
Lucy, not a word about this to
anyone till you hear from me.

20
00:06:13,658 --> 00:06:15,699
It's over here.

21
00:06:26,133 --> 00:06:29,836
- You want forensics first?
- No, she's been in the water.

22
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,471
We'd better take some pictures.

23
00:06:37,358 --> 00:06:39,731
- Who is she?
- Andy, the pictures.

24
00:06:39,862 --> 00:06:42,567
- Sorry.
- Then we'll turn her over.

25
00:07:05,731 --> 00:07:08,650
Same thing as last year
in Mr Blodgett's barn.

26
00:07:08,777 --> 00:07:11,696
- Give me the camera.
- Sorry.

27
00:07:11,823 --> 00:07:14,196
Is this going to happen every damn time?

28
00:07:14,326 --> 00:07:17,578
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

29
00:07:17,706 --> 00:07:22,287
Why don't you go up to the coroner's
van and bring back that stretcher?

30
00:07:22,422 --> 00:07:24,913
OK. Sorry.

31
00:07:28,722 --> 00:07:31,474
Harry, let's roll her over.

32
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:55,332
Good Lord, Laura!

33
00:07:57,804 --> 00:07:59,845
Laura Palmer.

34
00:08:06,859 --> 00:08:10,478
Laura, sweetheart, I'm not
going to tell you again.

35
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,453
Yes, I am.

36
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,388
For goodness' sake.

37
00:08:38,987 --> 00:08:41,396
Laura, now means now.

38
00:08:53,549 --> 00:08:56,717
Laura, honey, are you downstairs?

39
00:09:29,683 --> 00:09:31,890
- Hello.
- Beth, it's Sarah.

40
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:36,101
I just went up to wake Laura and
she's not here. Is she with Bobby?

41
00:09:36,234 --> 00:09:40,613
She could be. He goes running at 5:00
am and then he goes to football practice.

42
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:45,488
Can you find out? Can you
reach him? I'll call the school.

43
00:09:45,623 --> 00:09:48,328
I've got the number of
the field office here.

44
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,500
Thanks, Beth.

45
00:09:52,173 --> 00:09:56,124
I wonder if she went out with
Leland? He had an early meeting.

46
00:09:57,306 --> 00:10:00,509
I'm sure that's it. Either
that or she's with Bobby.

47
00:10:00,643 --> 00:10:04,690
Sure. I'll call up to the hotel. Thanks.

48
00:10:11,951 --> 00:10:15,736
No, Bobby hasn't shown
up for practice yet today.

49
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:20,911
As a matter of fact, he's been late
every day this week, Mrs Palmer.

50
00:10:21,047 --> 00:10:24,298
And last week. Maybe
even the week before.

51
00:11:03,482 --> 00:11:06,769
- Are they ready to sign?
- You're not going to mention

52
00:11:06,903 --> 00:11:10,772
that we haven't yet acquired
access to the Packard land?

53
00:11:13,496 --> 00:11:15,156
Sorry.

54
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,795
We have solid information

55
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:25,834
that the Packard sawmill is going
to go belly up within a year.

56
00:11:25,971 --> 00:11:30,386
We'll be able to get it for
a song. One verse, no chorus.

57
00:11:32,481 --> 00:11:34,308
Now...

58
00:11:34,442 --> 00:11:39,984
let's get out there and get those
cheese eaters where they live.

59
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,658
Benjamin.

60
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:50,087
...a clean, wholesome
environment, much like your own.

61
00:11:51,591 --> 00:11:55,970
With a quality of life
to rival the very best

62
00:11:56,097 --> 00:11:58,934
that this country has to offer.

63
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:04,483
That is what the Ghostwood
Country Club and Estates will be.

64
00:12:08,155 --> 00:12:10,529
When I first spoke to Sven,

65
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:16,036
he was naturally very concerned
about the quality of air here.

66
00:12:18,211 --> 00:12:23,255
If you'll permit me, Sven, to repeat
what you said this morning after your run:

67
00:12:23,511 --> 00:12:27,842
"My air sacks have never felt so good!"

68
00:12:33,692 --> 00:12:37,358
Your wife's on the phone
again. She said it's urgent.

69
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:43,996
Excuse me a moment,
gentlemen. I'll be right back.

70
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,827
Make it snappy.

71
00:12:48,963 --> 00:12:50,588
So...

72
00:12:51,425 --> 00:12:53,299
...here in Twin Peaks,

73
00:12:53,427 --> 00:12:57,509
health and industry go hand in hand.

74
00:12:59,937 --> 00:13:02,939
- I'll transfer you to the house phone.
- Thank you.

75
00:13:10,535 --> 00:13:13,371
- Sarah, what is it?
- Is Laura with you?

76
00:13:13,497 --> 00:13:16,037
- No, why?
- She didn't go with you this morning?

77
00:13:16,167 --> 00:13:19,205
No. Honey, what's wrong?
What's this all about?

78
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:24,466
- She wasn't here this morning.
- She's probably with Bobby.

79
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:28,639
- I can't find Bobby.
- There you are. That's it.

80
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:32,139
Let's not worry. They're
probably together.

81
00:13:32,273 --> 00:13:35,229
She would have left me a
note. She would have told me.

82
00:13:35,361 --> 00:13:38,032
Honey, take it easy, please.

83
00:13:38,157 --> 00:13:43,236
- I'm looking for Leland Palmer.
- He's right over there on the phone.

84
00:13:44,249 --> 00:13:46,373
Sheriff Truman.

85
00:13:46,585 --> 00:13:49,457
What? Who? What did you say?

86
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,139
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

87
00:14:03,067 --> 00:14:06,069
Leland, please. What is it? Tell me.

88
00:14:07,156 --> 00:14:10,527
- Leland...
- Is this about Laura?

89
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,613
I'm afraid it is.

90
00:14:16,544 --> 00:14:18,834
Leland, tell me.

91
00:14:19,507 --> 00:14:21,630
My baby!

92
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:34,232
We're ready to go with the contracts.

93
00:14:39,785 --> 00:14:42,360
Leland, what's wrong?

94
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:48,124
My daughter's dead.

95
00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:49,712
What kept you, Heidi?

96
00:15:49,842 --> 00:15:54,304
- I couldn't get my car started. -
Too busy jump-starting the old man?

97
00:15:56,476 --> 00:15:59,764
I thought you Germans
were always on time.

98
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,317
I thought the only time you cared
about, Bobby, was making time.

99
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:12,950
- You heading out, Shelly?
- Yeah, I'm heading home.

100
00:16:13,584 --> 00:16:16,289
I'm going to practice. I
can drop you on the way.

101
00:16:19,008 --> 00:16:21,417
That would be great, thanks.

102
00:16:28,062 --> 00:16:30,518
Here's a tune for you, gals.

103
00:16:34,196 --> 00:16:35,857
Norma...

104
00:16:37,075 --> 00:16:39,151
...l'll see you in my dreams.

105
00:16:40,288 --> 00:16:42,328
Not if I see you first.

106
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:46,415
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

107
00:16:59,732 --> 00:17:03,518
- I think she knows about us.
- Norma?

108
00:17:05,156 --> 00:17:09,404
Fat chance. I think she's
hot to try for you herself.

109
00:17:38,578 --> 00:17:40,987
It's happy hour in France.

110
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:44,365
Come on, cowboy. Light your fire.

111
00:17:44,503 --> 00:17:48,170
Right, just a little
pick-me-up before homeroom.

112
00:17:53,223 --> 00:17:56,142
I thought I was your
little pick-me-up.

113
00:17:56,603 --> 00:18:00,768
Baby, you are more like
a three-stage rocket.

114
00:18:02,027 --> 00:18:04,318
A pocket rocket.

115
00:18:05,324 --> 00:18:08,492
And what stage are we in now?

116
00:18:09,705 --> 00:18:13,076
Are you sure that your old
man is still on the road?

117
00:18:13,752 --> 00:18:16,326
Yes, he called me last night from Butte.

118
00:18:16,464 --> 00:18:20,334
That's a long way away and he
ain't got a phone in his truck.

119
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:24,304
Quit worrying and start
screwing, Mr Touchdown.

120
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,268
Butte!

121
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:32,228
Back up!

122
00:18:38,454 --> 00:18:40,079
I'll call you later.

123
00:18:57,564 --> 00:18:59,806
Leland, I'm so sorry.

124
00:19:00,401 --> 00:19:02,608
17 years old.

125
00:19:08,621 --> 00:19:13,083
- Lee, I hate to put you through this.
- No, I have to see her.

126
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:17,623
I have to see what was
done to my little girl.

127
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:48,507
My baby!

128
00:19:49,428 --> 00:19:51,256
That's my little girl.

129
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:55,142
- God!
- Let's get out of here.

130
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:49,595
- Have you seen Laura?
- No, not yet.

131
00:20:50,013 --> 00:20:52,719
Nice day for a picnic.

132
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:12,288
Bobby Briggs, they're looking for you.

133
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,248
- Who is?
- Sheriff is.

134
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,920
Well, here I am in school.

135
00:21:21,808 --> 00:21:23,635
Hey, Snake.

136
00:21:25,355 --> 00:21:28,107
- Something's up.
- Where?

137
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:31,860
- You think I'm kidding?
- What, me worried?

138
00:21:31,989 --> 00:21:34,777
Bobby, you're wanted in the office.

139
00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:38,612
- Who wants me in the office?
- Right now, young man.

140
00:21:40,417 --> 00:21:42,245
Watch out.

141
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:59,561
- Terry Franklin?
- Here.

142
00:21:59,694 --> 00:22:01,273
- Martha Grimes?
- Here.

143
00:22:01,405 --> 00:22:03,612
- Donna Hayward?
- Here.

144
00:22:03,741 --> 00:22:06,281
- Audrey Horne?
- Here.

145
00:22:06,413 --> 00:22:08,287
James Hurley?

146
00:22:10,335 --> 00:22:12,541
Excuse me. Room 106?

147
00:22:14,298 --> 00:22:17,550
Is there a Bobby Briggs
in this classroom?

148
00:22:17,678 --> 00:22:20,597
No, he's in 107. 107.

149
00:22:20,724 --> 00:22:24,260
- Could I speak to you for a moment?
- Certainly.

150
00:22:32,491 --> 00:22:34,733
...making the announcement.

151
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:39,950
Thank you for your time.

152
00:23:06,371 --> 00:23:10,074
There'll be an announcement
from the Principal.

153
00:23:24,855 --> 00:23:26,564
I told you.

154
00:23:26,691 --> 00:23:31,320
I got up early like I always do.
I went running like I always do.

155
00:23:31,448 --> 00:23:33,655
I had breakfast at the RR

156
00:23:33,785 --> 00:23:36,787
and I didn't go to practice
because I didn't feel like it.

157
00:23:36,914 --> 00:23:40,451
Why not, Bobby? Were you
upset about something?

158
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:43,458
You want to tell us about it?

159
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:47,542
Look, you guys, what did
I do? What's going on?

160
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,468
Mr Wolchezk, there's
rumours all over school.

161
00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:53,519
Maybe it's best if
they heard it from you.

162
00:23:53,647 --> 00:23:57,063
Mr Wolchezk, why don't you go
ahead and make that announcement?

163
00:23:57,193 --> 00:23:59,815
- Now?
- Now's the time.

164
00:24:00,949 --> 00:24:02,608
Excuse me.

165
00:24:03,285 --> 00:24:06,453
What is it, Sheriff? What's going on?

166
00:24:09,168 --> 00:24:11,541
Bobby, you look at me.

167
00:24:12,589 --> 00:24:16,423
Your girlfriend Laura
Palmer's been killed.

168
00:24:16,554 --> 00:24:19,591
She was found just after dawn.

169
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:26,684
She was with you last night. You weren't
where you should have been this morning.

170
00:24:26,818 --> 00:24:30,568
Have these fellows
advised you of your rights?

171
00:24:30,698 --> 00:24:33,903
Yes, but I didn't know why.

172
00:24:35,246 --> 00:24:37,703
- Laura's dead?
- Yes.

173
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:42,378
Did you understand your rights
as they were explained to you?

174
00:24:44,009 --> 00:24:46,381
You think I killed her?

175
00:24:46,512 --> 00:24:49,218
Bobby, you can phone your parents

176
00:24:49,349 --> 00:24:53,680
and they can arrange for a lawyer
to be with you when we talk again.

177
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,940
Andy, take Bobby out to make his call.

178
00:25:04,078 --> 00:25:06,237
I loved her.

179
00:25:07,666 --> 00:25:10,787
And she loved me.

180
00:25:10,921 --> 00:25:15,585
Because I wasn't at football practice
I killed my girlfriend? You are crazy!

181
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,714
You get off me.

182
00:25:18,307 --> 00:25:22,258
Bobby, we're going to
talk about this later.

183
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:28,361
May I have your attention,
please. This is Principal Wolchezk.

184
00:25:29,656 --> 00:25:33,323
I am deeply saddened to have to tell you

185
00:25:34,538 --> 00:25:39,249
that early this morning your
classmate Laura Palmer was found dead.

186
00:25:41,631 --> 00:25:45,049
This is a terrible moment for all of us.

187
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:52,602
For all of us who knew her.
Her friends, her family.

188
00:25:55,401 --> 00:25:56,978
It is very important

189
00:25:57,111 --> 00:26:01,775
that we all try to help each
other through this difficult time.

190
00:26:04,747 --> 00:26:09,458
The police have asked
me to ask each of you

191
00:26:11,422 --> 00:26:15,173
if you have any information
about Laura's activities

192
00:26:16,012 --> 00:26:18,765
after school yesterday

193
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,806
or yesterday evening,

194
00:26:21,937 --> 00:26:24,062
please come forward.

195
00:26:26,277 --> 00:26:30,572
I am dismissing all classes for the day,

196
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:35,447
but before we leave I would
like to ask each of you

197
00:26:36,792 --> 00:26:42,880
to join me in a moment
of silence for Laura

198
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:47,295
and her dear memory.

199
00:28:02,997 --> 00:28:05,914
You can talk to her now, Harry.

200
00:28:07,002 --> 00:28:12,295
Do you know what time it was when
you last saw Laura, Mrs Palmer?

201
00:28:15,347 --> 00:28:17,175
- What time?
- Yes.

202
00:28:18,351 --> 00:28:21,139
It would have been about nine.

203
00:28:22,649 --> 00:28:26,351
Yes, nine o'clock...

204
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,825
...pm.

205
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,280
She came home from Bobby's

206
00:28:36,585 --> 00:28:39,622
and she was going up the stairs.

207
00:28:41,592 --> 00:28:45,211
Those stairs...right there.

208
00:28:51,105 --> 00:28:55,686
- Who's upstairs?
- Your husband and one of my men.

209
00:29:01,829 --> 00:29:05,911
I can tell from the
sounds that it isn't her.

210
00:29:22,692 --> 00:29:24,649
Her diary.

211
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:31,534
Do you know where the
key to this is, sir?

212
00:29:33,916 --> 00:29:38,378
- Do you have to take that?
- We'll return it as soon as possible.

213
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:57,644
Did she say anything to you?

214
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:02,953
No.

215
00:30:04,626 --> 00:30:06,702
She said goodnight.

216
00:30:09,382 --> 00:30:13,298
And I said, "Goodnight.

217
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:20,772
"Goodnight, sweetheart."

218
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:36,958
Mrs Palmer, can you remember...

219
00:30:37,213 --> 00:30:40,833
Did she make or receive any phone calls?

220
00:30:43,722 --> 00:30:48,884
I heard her phone ring once.

221
00:30:49,772 --> 00:30:54,317
- About what time was that?
- I don't know who it was.

222
00:31:00,495 --> 00:31:02,288
Harry.

223
00:31:06,379 --> 00:31:10,959
That was Lucy. Got a call from a guy
who works at the mill, Janek Pulaski.

224
00:31:11,094 --> 00:31:14,380
Says his daughter didn't
come home last night

225
00:31:14,515 --> 00:31:18,182
and she didn't show up
at school today, either.

226
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:37,129
Two by fours, four by eights.

227
00:31:38,257 --> 00:31:42,338
Two by fours, four by eights.

228
00:31:46,727 --> 00:31:49,646
Did you hear me? You can't
do that to my workers.

229
00:31:49,773 --> 00:31:52,978
Don't walk away from me. Come back here.

230
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:56,980
You're not going anywhere. You're
not going to tell anybody anything.

231
00:31:57,867 --> 00:31:59,778
Catherine,

232
00:32:00,288 --> 00:32:03,575
I'm sorry if this offends you,
but I'm the owner of this sawmill.

233
00:32:03,709 --> 00:32:08,337
You don't knowthe first thing about
this mill. That's why I'm running it.

234
00:32:08,466 --> 00:32:12,381
I've never taken this authority
before, but maybe I should have.

235
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:18,395
- You're not shutting us down. -
Catherine, I have the final say-so.

236
00:32:19,564 --> 00:32:23,730
- Peter, push the plug.
- Pete, don't you dare.

237
00:32:28,202 --> 00:32:30,611
Catherine, please.

238
00:32:33,793 --> 00:32:38,622
Shorty, tell the boys to pull the plug.

239
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,884
That's right.

240
00:32:52,861 --> 00:32:56,113
May I have your attention.
This is Josie Packard.

241
00:32:56,826 --> 00:33:02,415
I have decided that in light of what
has happened, all work here will stop.

242
00:33:02,542 --> 00:33:03,787
Bitch!

243
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:08,962
This morning, as you know, the
body of Miss Laura Palmer...

244
00:33:09,092 --> 00:33:11,845
- What's your name?
- Fred Truax e.

245
00:33:12,347 --> 00:33:14,257
You're fired.

246
00:33:14,976 --> 00:33:20,221
Just now your co-worker and
a friend, Mr Janek Pulaski,

247
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:24,061
has learned that his daughter,

248
00:33:24,197 --> 00:33:28,446
one of Laura's schoolmates,
is missing since last night.

249
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:34,920
Today all work here will
stop. The mill will shut down.

250
00:33:37,883 --> 00:33:41,835
Perhaps you can spend the
day with your families.

251
00:33:42,222 --> 00:33:44,929
Thank you all for your attention.

252
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:18,014
What the hell?

253
00:34:54,657 --> 00:34:56,532
Laura's dead.

254
00:34:58,955 --> 00:35:01,032
Yeah, I heard.

255
00:35:04,463 --> 00:35:06,587
She was the one.

256
00:35:09,177 --> 00:35:11,218
Buy you a coffee?

257
00:35:13,017 --> 00:35:15,093
Can't do it.

258
00:35:18,858 --> 00:35:22,727
If you see Donna, could
you give this to her?

259
00:35:32,085 --> 00:35:33,117
Ed!

260
00:35:34,839 --> 00:35:37,627
They said those drapes
would be ready by 10:00.

261
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,344
I want those drapes up by nightfall.

262
00:36:04,589 --> 00:36:10,380
Diane, 11:30 am, February 24th.
I'm entering the town of Twin Peaks.

263
00:36:10,514 --> 00:36:14,644
Five miles south of the Canadian
border, 12 miles west of the state line.

264
00:36:15,146 --> 00:36:18,681
I've never seen so
many trees in my life.

265
00:36:18,817 --> 00:36:22,769
As WC Fields would say, "I'd
rather be here than Philadelphia."

266
00:36:22,907 --> 00:36:27,700
54 degrees on a slightly overcast
day. Weatherman said rain.

267
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:33,455
If you get paid for being wrong
60% of the time, it'd beat working!

268
00:36:33,588 --> 00:36:37,967
Mileage is 79,345. Gauge is on reserve.

269
00:36:38,094 --> 00:36:43,008
Got to tank up when I get into town.
Remind me to tell you how much that is.

270
00:36:43,185 --> 00:36:48,264
Lunch was $6 and 31 cents
at the Lamplighter Inn.

271
00:36:48,401 --> 00:36:51,272
That's on Highway 2, near Lewis Fork.

272
00:36:51,405 --> 00:36:55,903
That was a tuna fish sandwich, slice
of cherry pie and a cup of coffee.

273
00:36:56,037 --> 00:37:00,783
Damn good food! If you ever get up
here, that cherry pie is worth a stop.

274
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:06,584
Looks like I'll be meeting up with a...

275
00:37:07,052 --> 00:37:11,003
Sheriff Harry S Truman.
Shouldn't be too hard to remember.

276
00:37:11,141 --> 00:37:13,550
He'll be at the Calhoun
Memorial Hospital.

277
00:37:13,687 --> 00:37:18,516
Guess we'll take a look at that girl
who crawled down off the mountain.

278
00:37:18,651 --> 00:37:23,362
I'm sure the sheriff can recommend
a clean, reasonably priced motel.

279
00:37:23,492 --> 00:37:26,494
That's what I need: a clean
place, reasonably priced.

280
00:37:27,998 --> 00:37:30,324
Diane, I almost forgot.

281
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:34,708
I've got to find out what trees
these are. They're really something.

282
00:37:35,967 --> 00:37:37,925
- Agent Cooper?
- Yes.

283
00:37:38,054 --> 00:37:40,760
- Sheriff Harry S Truman.
- Dale Cooper, FBI.

284
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:42,765
- Pleasure.
- Good to meet you.

285
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:47,229
- Have any trouble finding the place?
- No, no. Fine.

286
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:50,811
Came out over Highway 2 near Lewis Fork.

287
00:37:50,947 --> 00:37:52,987
Stopped at the Lamplighter Inn.

288
00:37:53,116 --> 00:37:56,321
Had a slice of cherry pie. Incredible.

289
00:37:56,663 --> 00:38:00,034
I'll tell you, we're sure
glad to have the FBI here.

290
00:38:00,168 --> 00:38:04,168
Kind of lucky in a way that Ronnette
stepped out across the state line.

291
00:38:04,299 --> 00:38:08,049
- Whole town's badly shaken up.
- Sure, it's a nice quiet place.

292
00:38:08,179 --> 00:38:10,885
Sheriff, let me stop
you for just a second.

293
00:38:11,017 --> 00:38:13,555
There's a fewthings
we've got to get straight.

294
00:38:13,687 --> 00:38:16,475
It's best to talk about this up front.

295
00:38:16,608 --> 00:38:19,943
When the Bureau gets called
in, the Bureau's in charge.

296
00:38:20,071 --> 00:38:22,194
You'll be working for me.

297
00:38:22,324 --> 00:38:26,573
Sometimes local law enforcement
has a problem with that.

298
00:38:26,705 --> 00:38:28,865
We're glad to have you here.

299
00:38:29,001 --> 00:38:34,293
Sheriff, what kind of fantastic
trees have you got growing round here?

300
00:38:34,675 --> 00:38:37,677
- Big, majestic...
- Douglas firs.

301
00:38:38,346 --> 00:38:40,424
Douglas firs?

302
00:38:42,895 --> 00:38:46,763
Can someone get me a copy of the
coroner's report on the dead girl?

303
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,060
The autopsy hasn't been done yet,

304
00:38:49,196 --> 00:38:53,147
but I'll take you down to the
morgue when we're finished here.

305
00:38:53,284 --> 00:38:54,364
Fine.

306
00:38:59,042 --> 00:39:02,412
Dr Shelvy, this is FBI Agent Cooper.

307
00:39:03,173 --> 00:39:05,214
- Glad to know you.
- Doctor. How's the girl?

308
00:39:05,342 --> 00:39:07,882
She's in shock, suffering from exposure.

309
00:39:08,014 --> 00:39:11,217
- Can I see her?
- All right, this way.

310
00:39:27,624 --> 00:39:30,412
- Was she raped?
- Several times.

311
00:39:30,545 --> 00:39:33,880
- One perpetrator?
- We're waiting for the results.

312
00:39:34,634 --> 00:39:37,422
Is there any connection
to the dead girl?

313
00:39:37,554 --> 00:39:41,886
Same high school. As far as we
know, they hardly knew each other.

314
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:44,394
No connection.

315
00:39:46,567 --> 00:39:49,238
I'd like to question her.

316
00:39:49,363 --> 00:39:52,484
This girl doesn't even know
where she is or if she is.

317
00:39:52,618 --> 00:39:54,445
What exactly are you saying?

318
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:58,950
We need a CAT scan and we're
not equipped for that here.

319
00:39:59,085 --> 00:40:02,289
My opinion? She may
have neurological damage.

320
00:40:02,423 --> 00:40:04,879
She's not responsive at all.

321
00:40:07,763 --> 00:40:10,600
I'd like to examine her fingers.

322
00:40:16,151 --> 00:40:18,191
All right.

323
00:40:23,619 --> 00:40:28,082
- They've already scraped for particles.
- That's not what I'm looking for.

324
00:40:30,421 --> 00:40:33,589
There's nothing here, not a thing.

325
00:40:36,471 --> 00:40:38,594
Don't go there.

326
00:40:39,183 --> 00:40:41,722
Don't go there.

327
00:40:41,895 --> 00:40:43,176
Ronnie?

328
00:40:43,856 --> 00:40:45,730
Ronnette?

329
00:41:02,257 --> 00:41:05,295
Pull the fish out of
the water, big mouth.

330
00:41:05,428 --> 00:41:08,632
He's got a big mouth
that starts talking to me.

331
00:41:16,778 --> 00:41:18,403
Harry!

332
00:41:19,281 --> 00:41:20,562
Dr Jacoby.

333
00:41:22,661 --> 00:41:25,912
- Terrible, terrible tragedy.
- Yes.

334
00:41:31,131 --> 00:41:33,919
This is Special Agent Dale Cooper.

335
00:41:34,052 --> 00:41:36,590
- Gary Cooper?
- Agent Cooper.

336
00:41:36,722 --> 00:41:40,388
- Agent? FBI.
- Right.

337
00:41:41,103 --> 00:41:46,610
Dr Lawrence Jacoby, Agent Cooper.
Laura was a patient of mine.

338
00:41:47,529 --> 00:41:50,366
You're going to the morgue.
Do you mind if I join you?

339
00:41:50,492 --> 00:41:53,364
Yes, I do. Why would you want to?

340
00:41:53,495 --> 00:41:56,035
Sort of against procedure, Doctor.

341
00:41:56,166 --> 00:41:59,833
No offence. I thought
I could be of some help.

342
00:41:59,963 --> 00:42:04,592
- You still could be...at another time.
- I understand completely.

343
00:42:05,304 --> 00:42:07,428
By the way...

344
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,601
Laura's...Laura's parents.

345
00:42:12,647 --> 00:42:15,815
They didn't know that she was seeing me.

346
00:42:26,041 --> 00:42:28,367
That guy's a psychiatrist?

347
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:37,088
I have to apologise again
for the fluorescent lights.

348
00:42:37,223 --> 00:42:41,305
- I think it's a bad transformer.
- That's quite all right.

349
00:42:43,274 --> 00:42:47,403
Agent Cooper, we scraped those
nails when we brought her in.

350
00:42:50,158 --> 00:42:53,576
There it is. There it
is. My God, here it is!

351
00:42:53,705 --> 00:42:56,078
- What?
- Would you leave us, please?

352
00:42:56,208 --> 00:42:59,080
- Jim.
- Would you leave us alone, please?

353
00:42:59,213 --> 00:43:01,253
Certainly.

354
00:43:03,803 --> 00:43:06,591
I need something to grab onto this with.

355
00:43:30,465 --> 00:43:34,299
Diane, I'm at the Twin Peaks County
Morgue with the body of the victim.

356
00:43:34,429 --> 00:43:36,221
Laura Palmer.

357
00:43:36,348 --> 00:43:38,757
Diane, it's the same thing.

358
00:43:38,894 --> 00:43:42,513
- I told you we'd see this again.
- What have you got there?

359
00:43:43,191 --> 00:43:46,229
Ring finger, under the nail.

360
00:43:47,656 --> 00:43:50,148
Let's see what he left us.

361
00:43:53,456 --> 00:43:55,365
It's an 'R'.

362
00:43:56,586 --> 00:44:00,371
Diane, give this to Albert
and his team. Don't go to Sam.

363
00:44:00,507 --> 00:44:02,999
Albert has a bit more on the ball.

364
00:44:03,928 --> 00:44:08,557
OK, Cooper, are you going to let
me in on what's going on here?

365
00:44:09,979 --> 00:44:12,934
Sheriff, we've got a lot to talk about.

366
00:44:40,396 --> 00:44:43,268
- Hi, Ed.
- Hey, Donna.

367
00:44:52,413 --> 00:44:54,656
I'm so sorry.

368
00:44:58,046 --> 00:45:00,585
- Have you seen James yet?
- He came by.

369
00:45:00,716 --> 00:45:02,960
- Is he OK?
- No.

370
00:45:03,095 --> 00:45:06,762
Do you know where he went? I've
already been to the Roadhouse.

371
00:45:06,892 --> 00:45:09,811
I don't know, honey. He
told me to give you this.

372
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:24,203
What the hell are you doing? I've
been looking all over for you.

373
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:28,083
Bobby's in a lot of
trouble. He's my best friend.

374
00:45:28,213 --> 00:45:30,421
We're going to the police
station to be with him.

375
00:45:30,551 --> 00:45:35,974
Don't tell me where I ought to be!
Second, Laura was my best friend.

376
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,473
- Get in the car.
- Muffle it, junior.

377
00:45:38,603 --> 00:45:41,605
- Mind your own business.
- You're on my lot, friend.

378
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:45,152
Ed, I'm not your friend.

379
00:45:46,323 --> 00:45:49,075
Donna, you get to the
Sheriff's right now.

380
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:59,383
I sure know howto pick them.

381
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:04,007
You waiting for those
drapes to hang themselves?

382
00:46:07,059 --> 00:46:09,552
I know howto pick them, too.

383
00:46:12,401 --> 00:46:15,653
If James comes around, will you
tell him I'm looking for him?

384
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,988
You bet.

385
00:46:18,117 --> 00:46:20,787
And Donna, you take it easy.

386
00:46:33,555 --> 00:46:37,601
That's the videotape we just saw,
the one we found in Laura's bedroom.

387
00:46:38,354 --> 00:46:41,973
At a certain point, I'm going to
want to showthis to the boyfriend.

388
00:46:42,109 --> 00:46:44,067
You say when.

389
00:46:44,195 --> 00:46:48,147
- Did you complete your forensics?
- You bet. All done.

390
00:46:48,451 --> 00:46:51,370
- No key yet?
- We're still looking.

391
00:46:58,298 --> 00:47:00,043
Why not?

392
00:47:06,018 --> 00:47:08,937
Diane, I've just opened
Laura Palmer's diary.

393
00:47:09,064 --> 00:47:14,107
This is the last entry,
dated February 23rd.

394
00:47:15,155 --> 00:47:19,819
It reads: "Asparagus for
dinner again. I hate asparagus.

395
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:25,540
"Does this mean I'll never grow
up?" And then she's written:

396
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:30,714
"Nervous about meeting 'J' tonight."
That's the letter 'J', Diane.

397
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:39,683
And that is the last entry.
That's something to get started on.

398
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:44,605
- Yeah, that's one out of 26.
- One out of 26.

399
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:49,618
Diane, I've just turned
back 18 days to day one.

400
00:47:49,746 --> 00:47:54,125
Taped to the page is a plastic
envelope containing a white residue

401
00:47:54,253 --> 00:47:56,744
and a key to a safety deposit box.

402
00:47:57,506 --> 00:48:02,051
Sheriff, we have to very
carefully remove this key.

403
00:48:02,514 --> 00:48:05,267
We're going to run this envelope.

404
00:48:05,393 --> 00:48:09,688
My bet is it will test
positive for cocaine.

405
00:48:11,318 --> 00:48:14,937
- That's impossible.
- You ever been surprised before?

406
00:48:15,991 --> 00:48:20,037
Mr Cooper, you didn't know Laura Palmer.

407
00:48:20,164 --> 00:48:23,616
Let's get a court order to
open the safety deposit box

408
00:48:23,752 --> 00:48:28,047
and maybe we'll both find out
a fewthings about Laura Palmer.

409
00:48:34,934 --> 00:48:38,138
Diane, I'm holding a small
box of chocolate bunnies.

410
00:48:46,742 --> 00:48:49,828
- Lucy.
- Andy, is that you?

411
00:48:50,122 --> 00:48:54,418
Tell Harry we found
where... it happened.

412
00:48:55,755 --> 00:48:59,837
Where Ronnette and Laura
were taken and tortured.

413
00:49:00,428 --> 00:49:02,468
Tell Harry...

414
00:49:05,852 --> 00:49:08,261
...I didn't cry.

415
00:49:09,316 --> 00:49:14,359
Andy, are you OK? Sweetie?

416
00:49:15,283 --> 00:49:17,240
But, Lucy...

417
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:21,995
...it's so horrible.

418
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,372
Andy, sweetie.

419
00:49:29,135 --> 00:49:31,094
My God.

420
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:46,740
Bobby, you have been advised of your
constitutional rights. Am I correct?

421
00:49:46,869 --> 00:49:48,245
Yes.

422
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:53,042
- Bobby, did you kill Laura Palmer?
- No!

423
00:49:53,711 --> 00:49:57,876
She was studying at your house
until about 9:30 last night?

424
00:49:58,468 --> 00:50:00,758
- Yeah.
- Bobby.

425
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:03,510
Yes, sir.

426
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:08,020
- Did she drive herself home?
- Yes.

427
00:50:08,691 --> 00:50:11,812
You two had a big fight
last week, didn't you?

428
00:50:11,946 --> 00:50:16,573
So what? If I had a fight with
her, if I sang songs with her,

429
00:50:16,702 --> 00:50:19,870
if I went skipping rope with
her, what difference does it make?

430
00:50:19,998 --> 00:50:21,659
I didn't kill her.

431
00:50:27,008 --> 00:50:29,880
Bobby, here's howthis works:

432
00:50:30,012 --> 00:50:34,723
we ask the questions and you
answer the questions that we ask,

433
00:50:34,853 --> 00:50:37,772
briefly and to the point.

434
00:50:57,008 --> 00:51:00,213
Did you shoot this video, Bobby?

435
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:06,932
If you didn't, then who did?

436
00:51:07,774 --> 00:51:10,312
Did you know Laura was
seeing someone else?

437
00:51:11,363 --> 00:51:14,234
That's what you fought about last week.

438
00:51:16,578 --> 00:51:20,957
Look at these pictures.
Look how happy she is.

439
00:51:26,174 --> 00:51:31,218
- You ever do cocaine with Laura, Bobby?
- I don't do drugs.

440
00:51:31,349 --> 00:51:34,765
Excuse me, what are you
charging my client with?

441
00:51:39,401 --> 00:51:41,479
That's right.

442
00:51:43,281 --> 00:51:47,068
You're a football
player, aren't you, Bobby?

443
00:51:48,247 --> 00:51:51,285
If you knew who she was seeing...

444
00:51:53,546 --> 00:51:55,587
...tell us.

445
00:51:55,716 --> 00:51:59,501
- Ask Donna, she was with her.
- I'm asking you.

446
00:52:02,059 --> 00:52:05,226
Come on, Bobby, give me a name.

447
00:52:05,354 --> 00:52:08,143
Here's a hint: first initial 'J'.

448
00:52:23,505 --> 00:52:25,415
No...

449
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:29,966
...she wouldn't do that to me.

450
00:52:32,351 --> 00:52:34,925
You didn't love her anyway.

451
00:52:35,772 --> 00:52:37,183
Let him go.

452
00:52:50,543 --> 00:52:54,494
Julie, the Norwegians are signing
the contract at four o'clock.

453
00:52:54,632 --> 00:52:56,341
When Mr Horne returns,

454
00:52:56,468 --> 00:53:00,419
make sure they do not hear
about Laura Palmer's death.

455
00:53:00,557 --> 00:53:04,094
That will blowthe whole
deal. Got it? Thank you.

456
00:53:05,314 --> 00:53:08,482
OK, Bob. OK, Bob.

457
00:53:11,906 --> 00:53:17,248
Julie, what would happen
if I pulled this out?

458
00:53:18,123 --> 00:53:20,248
You wouldn't.

459
00:53:25,091 --> 00:53:27,465
Audrey, look what you've done!

460
00:53:29,765 --> 00:53:32,435
Did they scoff the whole smorgasbord?

461
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:35,183
- Audrey, don't go in there.
- I'm hungry.

462
00:53:35,314 --> 00:53:37,058
Don't go in there!

463
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:27,470
Excuse me, is there something
wrong, young pretty girl?

464
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:32,392
They found my friend Laura...

465
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:37,065
lying face down on a rocky beach,

466
00:54:38,027 --> 00:54:40,400
completely naked.

467
00:54:42,367 --> 00:54:44,361
She'd been murdered.

468
00:55:07,569 --> 00:55:11,520
- Hey, buddy.
- Snake. We're out of here, man.

469
00:55:11,658 --> 00:55:14,613
Just a sec. Donna's still in there.

470
00:55:16,248 --> 00:55:20,247
- You straightened her out yet?
- I don't know what's up with her.

471
00:55:20,379 --> 00:55:24,627
Forget her. I've got it
figured. Laura and her.

472
00:55:25,636 --> 00:55:29,504
That cop mentioned something
about the letter 'J'.

473
00:55:29,808 --> 00:55:32,182
We're looking at some freaking biker

474
00:55:32,311 --> 00:55:36,442
and some freaking biker is going
to get his head busted open.

475
00:55:36,568 --> 00:55:39,854
What's his name? We'll
finish this quick.

476
00:55:49,044 --> 00:55:50,753
Come outside.

477
00:55:53,174 --> 00:55:57,505
Robert, I'll be home this evening
if you need a sympathetic ear.

478
00:55:58,390 --> 00:56:01,677
I don't need any damn
sympathetic anything.

479
00:56:04,356 --> 00:56:07,478
I have no idea what's going on here.

480
00:56:07,611 --> 00:56:09,736
Let's just go home.

481
00:56:11,742 --> 00:56:14,281
So you were on a picnic,
just the two of you?

482
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:18,827
Way up in the mountains,
not another souI around?

483
00:56:19,754 --> 00:56:23,337
Is there some law
against having a picnic?

484
00:56:24,426 --> 00:56:29,423
Donna, this is interesting to me.
With just two of you out there,

485
00:56:29,559 --> 00:56:33,309
I can't figure out
howthese pictures got taken.

486
00:56:34,483 --> 00:56:36,772
That's easy.

487
00:56:36,944 --> 00:56:40,113
There was this...

488
00:56:40,574 --> 00:56:43,742
hiker that came along, a woman hiker.

489
00:56:43,871 --> 00:56:46,409
She had a backpack and...

490
00:56:48,711 --> 00:56:51,084
...we asked her to take
the pictures for us.

491
00:56:53,176 --> 00:56:55,418
What was her name?

492
00:56:55,554 --> 00:56:58,010
I don't think we asked her. I forgot.

493
00:57:04,316 --> 00:57:07,318
Donna, who are you protecting?

494
00:57:07,904 --> 00:57:10,112
Nobody, that's really what happened.

495
00:57:10,866 --> 00:57:14,403
Does this person's name
start with the letter 'J'?

496
00:57:14,539 --> 00:57:18,870
- She didn't tell us her name.
- Donna, this is serious business.

497
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:24,213
More serious than Laura falling in love
with someone other than her boyfriend.

498
00:57:24,344 --> 00:57:26,254
Much more serious.

499
00:57:26,389 --> 00:57:30,435
Agent Cooper, the Sheriff's
ready to roll up to the site

500
00:57:30,561 --> 00:57:33,018
and I've got something
else for you here.

501
00:57:33,816 --> 00:57:36,224
You can come on in.

502
00:57:38,864 --> 00:57:41,986
I know Laura was your best friend.

503
00:57:44,372 --> 00:57:48,158
You've been through a lot
today. We're finished for now.

504
00:58:06,153 --> 00:58:09,488
Go ahead, Lucy. Tell Agent
Cooper what you heard.

505
00:58:11,911 --> 00:58:14,663
After Bobby was taken back to his cell,

506
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:18,955
his parents were standing
by the door with his lawyer.

507
00:58:19,087 --> 00:58:22,921
Bobby was released and he came
out and saw his friend Mike,

508
00:58:23,052 --> 00:58:26,338
who was down by the water
cooler, which is near my desk.

509
00:58:26,473 --> 00:58:31,979
I pretended to be typing, but I was
typing what Mike and Bobby were saying.

510
00:58:32,106 --> 00:58:35,441
They didn't say exactly who
it was they were talking about,

511
00:58:35,569 --> 00:58:39,022
but anyway here's what they were saying.

512
00:58:39,158 --> 00:58:42,991
They said the person we're
looking for is a biker.

513
00:58:51,258 --> 00:58:53,501
Looks like a hog to me.

514
00:58:54,471 --> 00:58:58,256
- Holy smoke.
- Holy smoke!

515
00:59:25,139 --> 00:59:28,344
The Norwegians are leaving!

516
00:59:37,614 --> 00:59:39,692
The Norwegians are gone.

517
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:43,695
Everyone here has gone. Not good.

518
00:59:43,832 --> 00:59:47,083
You are throwing away the
investment opportunity of a lifetime.

519
00:59:47,212 --> 00:59:50,664
- Better that than throw a lifetime away.
- You stay out of this!

520
01:00:42,122 --> 01:00:43,913
Sheriff.

521
01:00:45,085 --> 01:00:47,659
Diane, it's 4:10 pm at
the scene of the crime.

522
01:00:47,797 --> 01:00:49,920
Here's something we haven't seen before:

523
01:00:50,049 --> 01:00:52,293
a mound of dirt, a foot
and a half in diameter.

524
01:00:52,428 --> 01:00:55,347
On the top is a gold
necklace with a gold heart.

525
01:00:55,473 --> 01:00:58,345
Correction: half a gold heart.

526
01:00:58,478 --> 01:01:02,145
At the base of the mound of
dirt is a torn piece of newsprint

527
01:01:02,275 --> 01:01:05,361
written with the words,
which appear to be in blood,

528
01:01:05,488 --> 01:01:08,573
"Fire walk with me".

529
01:01:11,538 --> 01:01:16,166
Sheriff, you and I have got to find out
who's got the other half of that heart.

530
01:02:09,995 --> 01:02:11,787
Mrs Horne?

531
01:02:13,626 --> 01:02:16,912
It might help if you
talked to Johnny yourself.

532
01:02:17,047 --> 01:02:20,084
So you think it might help?

533
01:02:20,552 --> 01:02:22,794
You can tell Johnny one more time

534
01:02:22,930 --> 01:02:26,597
that Laura isn't coming this
afternoon to work with him.

535
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:30,181
Or tomorrow afternoon or any afternoon.

536
01:02:30,315 --> 01:02:33,852
What is so difficult to
understand about that?

537
01:02:48,925 --> 01:02:51,049
It fell down.

538
01:02:52,597 --> 01:02:56,181
I knew Laura. She was always so nice.

539
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:58,599
When was the last time she came in?

540
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:02,812
I couldn't tell you exactly.
We have so many box es.

541
01:03:02,944 --> 01:03:06,279
- You don't keep records?
- We have plenty of paperwork.

542
01:03:06,408 --> 01:03:08,816
How long has she had this box?

543
01:03:08,953 --> 01:03:12,953
I'd say about six months.
I could check for you.

544
01:03:13,084 --> 01:03:16,454
Would you, please? And close
the door on the way out.

545
01:03:29,398 --> 01:03:31,392
"Flesh World".

546
01:03:31,652 --> 01:03:33,395
Man!

547
01:03:42,542 --> 01:03:47,882
There's over 10,000 dollars here.
That's a lot of girl scout cookies.

548
01:03:53,682 --> 01:03:56,353
Here's a page that's marked.

549
01:04:00,734 --> 01:04:03,985
There's your connection:
Ronnette Pulaski.

550
01:04:05,407 --> 01:04:07,068
I can't believe it.

551
01:04:16,423 --> 01:04:21,846
...the law enforcement officials
emerging from an abandoned railway car...

552
01:04:22,764 --> 01:04:25,257
Shelly, would you turn
the television off?

553
01:04:26,019 --> 01:04:28,690
Why, Leo? I want to see this.

554
01:04:29,566 --> 01:04:31,227
Shelly, turn it off.

555
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:33,769
...escaped her captor
and fled to safety,

556
01:04:33,906 --> 01:04:36,943
remains hospitalised
in critical condition...

557
01:04:39,205 --> 01:04:42,456
Shelly, sit down here a
minute and help me out.

558
01:04:48,759 --> 01:04:51,596
What kind of cigarettes do you smoke?

559
01:04:52,056 --> 01:04:53,800
Whatever's around.

560
01:04:53,934 --> 01:04:58,229
No, you don't. You smoke these.
What are these doing here?

561
01:04:59,399 --> 01:05:03,481
I pick up different packs from the
diner all the time, me and Norma.

562
01:05:03,614 --> 01:05:05,322
Two things, Shelly.

563
01:05:05,450 --> 01:05:09,116
When I come home, this house
should be clean and I mean clean.

564
01:05:09,246 --> 01:05:11,656
You smoke one brand of
cigarettes from now on.

565
01:05:11,792 --> 01:05:14,581
If I ever see two brands
of cigarettes again,

566
01:05:14,713 --> 01:05:17,750
I'm going to snap your neck like a twig.

567
01:05:17,884 --> 01:05:20,257
You have nothing to worry
about with me, darling.

568
01:05:20,388 --> 01:05:22,262
That's right.

569
01:05:35,033 --> 01:05:36,991
Big Ed's Gas Farm. Ed speaking.

570
01:05:37,119 --> 01:05:40,454
I'm sorry. I know I promised
not to call you there,

571
01:05:40,999 --> 01:05:43,243
but I have to see you.

572
01:05:44,129 --> 01:05:47,001
- I hurt so bad.
- It's OK.

573
01:05:49,970 --> 01:05:53,638
Why don't I meet you at
the Roadhouse around 9:30?

574
01:05:54,101 --> 01:05:57,721
Thank you, Ed. I'll see you tonight.

575
01:05:57,857 --> 01:06:00,349
All right, sweetheart.

576
01:06:19,178 --> 01:06:23,129
- I think I saw a cottontail rabbit.
- Must have been a snowshoe rabbit.

577
01:06:23,267 --> 01:06:27,313
Snowshoe? Snowshoe rabbit?

578
01:06:32,865 --> 01:06:34,774
Who's the babe?

579
01:06:34,908 --> 01:06:39,204
That is one of the most beautiful
women in the state. Mrs Packard.

580
01:06:39,331 --> 01:06:41,539
Packard Sawmill?

581
01:06:42,210 --> 01:06:45,581
- Where's Mr Packard?
- Died in a boating accident.

582
01:06:45,716 --> 01:06:49,881
Andrew Packard practically built this
town. Brought her over from Hong Kong.

583
01:06:50,013 --> 01:06:54,227
Left her everything, which
didn't exactly please his sister.

584
01:06:54,353 --> 01:06:57,308
That's her, the original deep freeze.

585
01:06:57,441 --> 01:06:59,398
Who's the glad-handing dandy?

586
01:07:00,236 --> 01:07:03,938
Benjamin Horne, local
big-wig. He owns half the town.

587
01:07:04,075 --> 01:07:06,613
He's not after her. He's after her land.

588
01:07:13,713 --> 01:07:17,333
- Who's the lady with the log?
- We call her the Log Lady.

589
01:07:25,396 --> 01:07:30,523
Ladies and gentlemen, if I
could have your attention.

590
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,194
Is this thing on?

591
01:07:36,328 --> 01:07:38,452
- Is this thing on?
- Hang on, Dwayne.

592
01:07:43,171 --> 01:07:45,663
Thank you, Mayor Milford.

593
01:07:46,426 --> 01:07:47,589
Agent Cooper.

594
01:07:52,393 --> 01:07:54,469
Thank you, Sheriff.

595
01:07:54,812 --> 01:07:58,812
Ladies and gentlemen, FBI
Special Agent Dale Cooper.

596
01:07:59,987 --> 01:08:03,938
One year ago, in a town in the
south-west corner of this state,

597
01:08:04,076 --> 01:08:07,493
the body of a young girl
named Teresa Banks was found.

598
01:08:07,622 --> 01:08:11,207
She had no family. No one
came forward to claim her body.

599
01:08:11,336 --> 01:08:14,872
It wasn't even news...until today.

600
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:19,595
There are irrefutable similarities,
which I cannot discuss,

601
01:08:19,723 --> 01:08:22,559
that lead us to conclude
Laura Palmer was the second

602
01:08:22,685 --> 01:08:27,314
and Ronnette Pulaski would have been
the third victim of the same killer.

603
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:31,564
There is a chance the person
who committed these crimes

604
01:08:31,698 --> 01:08:36,278
is someone from this town,
possibly even someone you know.

605
01:08:37,164 --> 01:08:41,994
It is vitally important that
this not turn into a witch hunt.

606
01:08:42,129 --> 01:08:47,173
I would suggest a temporary curfew
for those under eighteen years of age.

607
01:08:48,221 --> 01:08:51,472
Keeping your kids off the
streets now may teach them caution

608
01:08:51,601 --> 01:08:55,220
that may protect them in
the days and weeks to come.

609
01:08:55,356 --> 01:08:59,651
I will remind you that these
crimes occurred at night.

610
01:09:17,011 --> 01:09:20,179
When I left the house,
Sarah was sleeping.

611
01:09:20,308 --> 01:09:23,345
Leland made it through the day somehow.

612
01:09:23,479 --> 01:09:25,935
I'm not sure I could have done the same.

613
01:09:26,066 --> 01:09:28,771
Poor dear, poor Sarah.

614
01:09:29,821 --> 01:09:34,983
Eileen, the brutality...the
madness of it.

615
01:09:35,954 --> 01:09:37,948
I know.

616
01:09:38,333 --> 01:09:42,914
They're not releasing many
details. Wisely, I suppose.

617
01:09:43,799 --> 01:09:48,629
At the scene where it happened,
no one else knows this,

618
01:09:48,764 --> 01:09:51,007
they found part of a necklace,

619
01:09:51,143 --> 01:09:53,813
half of a golden heart.

620
01:09:53,938 --> 01:09:56,395
It was Laura's.

621
01:09:56,734 --> 01:10:01,978
They know this because she was wearing
it in a video of a picnic they found.

622
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:07,373
I'm telling you this because
Donna was in the video with her.

623
01:10:08,041 --> 01:10:12,040
She won't tell them who shot
it or who else was with them,

624
01:10:12,548 --> 01:10:17,176
but they think the killer may
have the other half of the heart.

625
01:10:29,155 --> 01:10:32,690
Donna, which do you like better?

626
01:10:33,578 --> 01:10:36,496
"The blossom of the evening"

627
01:10:36,623 --> 01:10:40,539
or "The full flower of the evening"?

628
01:10:42,548 --> 01:10:45,336
Listen to me, this is serious.

629
01:10:45,594 --> 01:10:47,754
This is serious, too.

630
01:10:48,598 --> 01:10:52,051
I'm going out the window and
I need you to cover for me.

631
01:10:52,187 --> 01:10:55,687
Don't you know there's a curfew?
They announced it on the radio.

632
01:10:55,816 --> 01:10:59,484
I know, Einstein. That's why
I need you to cover for me.

633
01:10:59,614 --> 01:11:02,984
I suppose this will include a
phone conversation with Mike,

634
01:11:03,118 --> 01:11:05,990
Mr Bonehead Boyfriend?

635
01:11:06,457 --> 01:11:10,955
No, this is about Laura
and it's really serious.

636
01:11:13,508 --> 01:11:15,169
Check.

637
01:11:17,263 --> 01:11:19,257
Thank you.

638
01:11:37,583 --> 01:11:41,832
- I'll need to borrow your bike.
- Then, pump some air in the back tyre.

639
01:11:42,507 --> 01:11:45,712
Yeah. Harriet, don't
forget to brush your teeth.

640
01:11:51,478 --> 01:11:53,471
Actually,

641
01:11:55,317 --> 01:11:57,987
now that some time has passed,

642
01:11:59,489 --> 01:12:02,907
I like "The full
blossom of the evening".

643
01:12:12,049 --> 01:12:13,544
Hey, Snake.

644
01:12:14,385 --> 01:12:17,721
Don't take any oink
oink off that pretty pig.

645
01:12:18,474 --> 01:12:20,883
Don't you worry about that.

646
01:12:32,995 --> 01:12:35,866
Hi, Doctor Hayward. I'd
like to talk to Donna.

647
01:12:35,999 --> 01:12:39,204
Donna's upstairs getting
ready for bed, Mike.

648
01:12:41,757 --> 01:12:44,510
You're not drinking
and driving, are you?

649
01:12:44,636 --> 01:12:48,339
We're all pretty broken up
about what happened today, sir.

650
01:12:48,474 --> 01:12:51,477
Besides, Bobby's doing
most of the driving.

651
01:12:52,690 --> 01:12:55,264
I'll see if she wants to come down.

652
01:12:55,402 --> 01:12:58,320
Would you mind waiting out here, please?

653
01:13:06,124 --> 01:13:08,996
The best-laid plans of mice and men.

654
01:13:12,091 --> 01:13:13,717
Snake, let's go!

655
01:13:32,704 --> 01:13:34,946
Where's your sister?

656
01:13:35,123 --> 01:13:40,417
Dad, I'm going to tell it to you and
I'm going to tell it to you straight.

657
01:13:40,548 --> 01:13:42,340
Harriet!

658
01:13:43,802 --> 01:13:46,046
See that window?

659
01:13:46,974 --> 01:13:48,848
Later.

660
01:13:54,443 --> 01:13:58,192
- Donna's not here.
- You mean she snuck out?

661
01:13:58,323 --> 01:14:01,360
Mike, maybe you have an idea
where she might have gone.

662
01:14:02,453 --> 01:14:05,077
Oh, we'll find her. Don't
you worry about that.

663
01:14:09,422 --> 01:14:11,082
Roadhouse.

664
01:14:12,801 --> 01:14:14,380
Let's go!

665
01:14:24,150 --> 01:14:26,987
Sheriff, I've got a call
for you from Dr Hayward.

666
01:14:27,113 --> 01:14:29,949
I explained that you're on
a stake-out at the Roadhouse,

667
01:14:30,075 --> 01:14:33,411
but he still would very
much like to talk to you.

668
01:14:33,539 --> 01:14:35,117
Patch him through.

669
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:38,834
I'm going to patch him
through to you now, Sheriff.

670
01:14:40,590 --> 01:14:43,842
I'm patching you
through now, Dr Hayward.

671
01:14:44,554 --> 01:14:47,426
Harry, my daughter Donna
snuck out of the house.

672
01:14:47,558 --> 01:14:49,267
I don't know where she's gone.

673
01:14:49,395 --> 01:14:54,557
Doc, you rest easy now. I'm going
to put out an all points for her.

674
01:14:54,693 --> 01:14:58,064
- We'll keep our eyes peeled.
- Thanks, Harry.

675
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:01,488
You betcha.

676
01:15:01,621 --> 01:15:05,834
- Lucy, you take care of that all points now.
- All right, Sheriff.

677
01:15:06,711 --> 01:15:09,879
- Of course Donna snuck out.
- Meaning what?

678
01:15:10,007 --> 01:15:13,294
How else is she going
to lead us to that biker?

679
01:15:31,746 --> 01:15:34,914
So all afternoon I've
been hanging drapes.

680
01:15:35,250 --> 01:15:37,375
- Drapes?
- Drapes.

681
01:15:38,672 --> 01:15:40,749
Lots of them.

682
01:15:41,301 --> 01:15:45,549
You know how I feel about you, Ed.
Don't do it for me, do it for yourself.

683
01:15:46,892 --> 01:15:49,847
- It's Tammy Wynette time, darling.
- Yeah?

684
01:15:51,023 --> 01:15:54,523
- What about you and Hank?
- I told you.

685
01:15:56,155 --> 01:15:59,774
- I'm going to leave Hank.
- Before or after he gets parole?

686
01:16:04,583 --> 01:16:08,879
I love you, Ed. I'll do
what's best for both of us.

687
01:16:10,467 --> 01:16:13,754
When your sweetheart's husband's
in the joint for manslaughter,

688
01:16:13,889 --> 01:16:16,891
the word "parole" has
a nasty ring to it.

689
01:16:38,089 --> 01:16:39,999
You know why I'm whittling?

690
01:16:40,134 --> 01:16:44,133
OK, I'll bite again.
Why are you whittling?

691
01:16:44,264 --> 01:16:46,138
That's what you do in a town

692
01:16:46,267 --> 01:16:50,183
where a yellow light still
means slow down, not speed up.

693
01:16:58,200 --> 01:16:59,993
Mike and Bobby.

694
01:17:00,871 --> 01:17:04,122
There's liable to be a
little trouble this evening.

695
01:17:41,428 --> 01:17:44,964
Scottie, Mutt and Jeff just crawled in.

696
01:17:48,562 --> 01:17:51,138
Oh, what a wonderful world!

697
01:17:56,031 --> 01:17:58,570
Looks like sooner than later.

698
01:18:02,833 --> 01:18:08,209
- Why don't you whistle for a little backup?
- I see which way the wind's blowing.

699
01:18:08,341 --> 01:18:12,720
Lucy, get us a backup unit at the
Roadhouse right away. Make that two.

700
01:18:12,847 --> 01:18:16,846
And call Dr Hayward. Tell him we've
found his daughter and she's fine.

701
01:18:16,978 --> 01:18:18,556
All right, Sheriff.

702
01:18:34,377 --> 01:18:36,003
Donna!

703
01:18:36,630 --> 01:18:39,965
Why are you sneaking around?
Everybody's looking for you.

704
01:18:47,771 --> 01:18:50,608
Get your hands off me. Leave me alone!

705
01:18:50,734 --> 01:18:52,276
Get your hands off me!

706
01:18:52,402 --> 01:18:55,523
- Get your hands off me. Let go of me.
- No!

707
01:18:55,657 --> 01:18:57,567
That's enough!

708
01:18:57,702 --> 01:19:00,740
You heard him. Let me go!

709
01:19:01,874 --> 01:19:04,413
Like that, Mr Monkey Wrench?

710
01:19:13,182 --> 01:19:16,802
You guys got it covered? Don't
worry, I'll take you to James.

711
01:19:24,656 --> 01:19:27,230
Joey Paulsen. That's a 'J'.

712
01:19:27,493 --> 01:19:29,902
No, he's taking her to somebody else.

713
01:19:30,038 --> 01:19:33,124
You want me to follow them
at a discreet distance?

714
01:19:33,711 --> 01:19:35,703
Harry, you're all right.

715
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:05,628
Hold on!

716
01:20:06,715 --> 01:20:11,878
- Do you think they spotted us?
- Give me a doughnut.

717
01:20:30,415 --> 01:20:33,121
Well, Harry, I think we lost them.

718
01:20:35,255 --> 01:20:40,465
Man, smell those trees!
Smell those Douglas firs.

719
01:20:41,055 --> 01:20:43,214
I think I hear them.

720
01:20:44,518 --> 01:20:47,271
- What's down there?
- An old logging road.

721
01:20:47,397 --> 01:20:51,182
The only access is five miles
back at the Packard mill.

722
01:20:51,778 --> 01:20:54,021
I told Doc Hayward his daughter was OK.

723
01:20:54,156 --> 01:20:55,485
My fault, Harry.

724
01:20:55,617 --> 01:20:58,572
- Thanks, Joe.
- Good luck, James.

725
01:21:20,736 --> 01:21:23,904
James, they're looking for you.

726
01:21:24,032 --> 01:21:26,109
I'm going to talk to them,

727
01:21:26,243 --> 01:21:28,570
but I think they're going to lock me up.

728
01:21:28,705 --> 01:21:30,082
Why?

729
01:21:31,125 --> 01:21:34,128
I don't have an alibi for
last night. I was with her.

730
01:21:34,255 --> 01:21:39,500
- James, what happened last night?
- It was kinda like a nightmare.

731
01:21:39,637 --> 01:21:43,802
- Donna, she was a different person.
- What are you saying?

732
01:21:44,478 --> 01:21:47,562
I'm telling you, there were
things she was involved with,

733
01:21:47,690 --> 01:21:52,318
things she let herself get pulled into,
things she thought you'd hate her for.

734
01:21:52,447 --> 01:21:54,607
She said, "There are things about me..."

735
01:21:54,742 --> 01:21:57,661
She said, "Even Donna doesn't know me."

736
01:21:58,581 --> 01:22:02,876
I knew her. I knew her
better than she thought I did.

737
01:22:03,045 --> 01:22:06,961
Donna, she said something
about a guy getting killed.

738
01:22:07,761 --> 01:22:09,919
- Who?
- She didn't say.

739
01:22:10,556 --> 01:22:17,011
But she said Bobby told
her that he killed this guy.

740
01:22:18,316 --> 01:22:20,275
Oh, my God.

741
01:22:20,445 --> 01:22:23,363
This is why I had to see you.

742
01:22:24,283 --> 01:22:29,113
It all makes some kind of terrible sense
that she died, that someone killed her.

743
01:22:29,249 --> 01:22:32,037
I don't know. I can't explain it.

744
01:22:32,170 --> 01:22:34,578
I didn't know whether to
believe any of this last night.

745
01:22:34,715 --> 01:22:38,416
I mean, half the time she
wasn't making any sense.

746
01:22:38,553 --> 01:22:42,339
I couldn't calm her down. I
could hardly keep her on the bike.

747
01:22:42,476 --> 01:22:46,142
We came to the light
at Sparkwood and 21,

748
01:22:46,273 --> 01:22:51,613
and she... she put her
hands around my neck

749
01:22:53,741 --> 01:22:58,536
and she screamed she loved me.

750
01:23:00,668 --> 01:23:02,875
I looked into her eyes. They were clear.

751
01:23:03,004 --> 01:23:06,090
It was like she was Laura again.

752
01:23:06,217 --> 01:23:10,382
She was so sad. She
sounded so desperate.

753
01:23:12,351 --> 01:23:16,266
Then she ran off. I
let her go and she died.

754
01:23:16,899 --> 01:23:18,856
It's OK.

755
01:23:20,737 --> 01:23:23,443
It's not your fault, James.

756
01:23:25,327 --> 01:23:27,321
It's OK.

757
01:23:28,415 --> 01:23:31,915
James. It's all right, James.

758
01:23:46,065 --> 01:23:47,856
Oh, my God.

759
01:23:48,819 --> 01:23:50,148
I'm sorry.

760
01:23:52,699 --> 01:23:54,740
Oh, my God.

761
01:23:57,998 --> 01:24:01,832
I changed my mind. I'm not sorry.

762
01:24:18,401 --> 01:24:20,276
James.

763
01:24:24,452 --> 01:24:26,327
James.

764
01:24:30,711 --> 01:24:36,134
Oh, James. Those are sirens.

765
01:24:38,638 --> 01:24:43,302
I've got to go to the
police. I don't have an alibi.

766
01:24:44,314 --> 01:24:46,852
After she left I just rode around.

767
01:24:46,984 --> 01:24:50,318
The necklace you gave
Laura with the golden heart.

768
01:24:50,447 --> 01:24:53,651
- You have to give me the other half.
- Why?

769
01:24:53,785 --> 01:24:57,914
They found the half where she was killed
and think the killer has the other half.

770
01:24:58,041 --> 01:25:00,829
If you go there with the
necklace and no alibi...

771
01:25:00,962 --> 01:25:03,169
- What about you?
- I'll get rid of it.

772
01:25:03,298 --> 01:25:05,458
- No.
- We'll hide it.

773
01:25:06,011 --> 01:25:10,176
- All right. We'll bury it.
- OK.

774
01:25:11,644 --> 01:25:14,599
- Right here.
- OK.

775
01:25:47,444 --> 01:25:49,437
I'll take you home.

776
01:26:12,479 --> 01:26:15,398
- What goes around comes around.
- Round and round.

777
01:26:36,638 --> 01:26:39,094
That's not Joey, that's James Hurley.

778
01:26:39,224 --> 01:26:43,389
James, stand away from the
bike. Stand away from the girl.

779
01:26:43,522 --> 01:26:47,142
- Put your hands behind your head.
- He didn't do anything!

780
01:26:47,569 --> 01:26:49,859
She's probably right.

781
01:26:54,747 --> 01:26:57,701
James. He didn't do anything.

782
01:27:01,756 --> 01:27:04,213
Lucy, get an arrest form ready.

783
01:27:06,846 --> 01:27:08,805
Doc, I'm releasing her to you,

784
01:27:08,933 --> 01:27:12,019
but I want her back for
questioning in the morning.

785
01:27:12,146 --> 01:27:14,139
- All right, Harry.
- Andy, Hawk.

786
01:27:14,274 --> 01:27:17,229
Put James back in number four.

787
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:23,359
James.

788
01:27:24,162 --> 01:27:26,655
It's gonna be all right.

789
01:27:40,602 --> 01:27:42,477
You!

790
01:27:53,328 --> 01:27:55,369
We'll check on you later.

791
01:28:01,924 --> 01:28:04,333
Good night, officers.

792
01:28:24,331 --> 01:28:26,407
I'm sorry, Dad.

793
01:28:29,003 --> 01:28:32,171
Donna, after what happened today,

794
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:37,130
I'm sure you understand what you put
your mother and me through tonight.

795
01:28:38,392 --> 01:28:43,981
But I know you wouldn't have done
it unless you had a good reason.

796
01:28:47,363 --> 01:28:51,148
We also have another problem
facing us, young lady.

797
01:28:52,954 --> 01:28:55,826
Where's your sister's bicycle?

798
01:28:56,667 --> 01:28:59,374
I left it at the Roadhouse.

799
01:28:59,797 --> 01:29:02,335
We'll have to go get it.

800
01:29:03,927 --> 01:29:09,007
I understand you promised Harriet
you'd put some air in the back tyre.

801
01:29:09,727 --> 01:29:11,804
Yes, I did.

802
01:29:14,067 --> 01:29:17,817
We're so thankful to
have a daughter like you.

803
01:29:25,541 --> 01:29:27,915
A policeman's dream!

804
01:29:28,254 --> 01:29:32,170
Yup, Lucy sets it up for us every night.

805
01:29:32,301 --> 01:29:33,796
Is everything OK?

806
01:29:33,928 --> 01:29:38,308
There's extra jelly doughnuts for Agent
Cooper and there's some extra decaf.

807
01:29:38,435 --> 01:29:42,516
You know, Andy's been drinking
so much caffeinated coffee lately.

808
01:29:42,649 --> 01:29:47,443
Thank you, Lucy. You can go back
to work now and no listening.

809
01:29:47,948 --> 01:29:50,321
Sheriff, that reminds me.

810
01:29:50,869 --> 01:29:54,820
Can you recommend a good,
inexpensive hotel or motel?

811
01:29:54,957 --> 01:29:57,496
It doesn't have to be fancy.

812
01:29:57,628 --> 01:30:00,167
I can get you a good rate
up at the Great Northern.

813
01:30:00,298 --> 01:30:02,921
I think I'm going to
be here for some time.

814
01:30:03,053 --> 01:30:06,008
These motels promise you a good rate,

815
01:30:06,140 --> 01:30:08,383
but when you get there
it's a different story.

816
01:30:08,519 --> 01:30:12,684
All I need is a bed, a
bathroom, a telephone,

817
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:17,647
and sometimes a television, in the
event I get a chance to knock off early.

818
01:30:17,781 --> 01:30:21,152
I can get you a good rate
up at the Great Northern.

819
01:30:21,328 --> 01:30:23,120
Sold.

820
01:30:23,248 --> 01:30:26,036
Well, tomorrow comes early.

821
01:30:31,050 --> 01:30:33,755
Diane, it's 12:28 am.

822
01:30:33,887 --> 01:30:37,008
I'll be staying locally at
the Great Northern Hotel.

823
01:30:37,142 --> 01:30:39,634
Sheriff's getting me a rate.

824
01:30:43,276 --> 01:30:45,814
When you least expect it.

825
01:31:23,749 --> 01:31:25,541
Hello, Sheriff.

826
01:31:27,587 --> 01:31:29,462
Hey, Jo.

827
01:31:30,133 --> 01:31:33,967
I understand you wanted
to see the Sheriff up here.

828
01:31:34,097 --> 01:31:36,090
Yes, I did.

829
01:31:38,478 --> 01:31:40,602
Right over here.

830
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:54,157
He's here again.

831
01:31:54,334 --> 01:31:57,834
Let's get together and talk about it.

832
01:31:58,631 --> 01:32:00,292
All right.

833
01:32:10,815 --> 01:32:12,523
All right.

834
01:32:19,327 --> 01:32:24,240
It must have happened about
this time 24 hours ago.

835
01:32:27,380 --> 01:32:29,041
I'm afraid.
