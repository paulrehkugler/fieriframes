1
00:01:18,099 --> 00:01:20,431
The Grand Prince is coming.

2
00:01:31,679 --> 00:01:33,203
The brother has arrived.

3
00:02:43,985 --> 00:02:45,885
Hold him, hold him!

4
00:02:56,864 --> 00:03:01,028
Brothers, what are you doing?
We are all fellow Russians.

5
00:03:02,737 --> 00:03:05,467
I'll show you if we are fellow
Russians, you Vladimir swine!

6
00:03:10,611 --> 00:03:12,636
Catch him! Catch him!

7
00:03:16,517 --> 00:03:20,146
Run around! Don't you hear me?

8
00:03:38,806 --> 00:03:42,640
Where the devil are
we? There's no one here.

9
00:03:43,611 --> 00:03:45,135
They've all fled.

10
00:03:53,521 --> 00:03:56,547
How your bitch has grown;
doesn't remember me, eh?

11
00:03:56,691 --> 00:03:59,125
Vaska, take the dog.

12
00:04:18,245 --> 00:04:22,045
Oh please, let me go!

13
00:04:39,233 --> 00:04:42,669
Don't be afraid, beautiful.

14
00:04:42,737 --> 00:04:45,399
I'll show you how Tatars can love.

15
00:06:31,412 --> 00:06:32,436
Well, Prince?

16
00:06:35,783 --> 00:06:37,978
Aren't you sorry about the cathedral?

17
00:09:14,843 --> 00:09:18,574
Tell me, Prince, who is that woman?

18
00:09:21,383 --> 00:09:26,821
It's no woman, it's the
Virgin Mary: the Nativity.

19
00:09:28,457 --> 00:09:29,822
Who is in the box?

20
00:09:31,093 --> 00:09:33,391
Christ, her son.

21
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:37,990
How can she be a
virgin if she has a son?

22
00:09:43,138 --> 00:09:46,232
Strange things happen in Russia!

23
00:09:51,213 --> 00:09:52,703
Very interesting.

24
00:09:55,183 --> 00:09:57,674
Tie his legs tighter!

25
00:09:57,753 --> 00:10:00,688
Tell the truth, you dog!

26
00:10:02,591 --> 00:10:06,459
Hold on, hold on! I
haven't seen your gold.

27
00:10:06,528 --> 00:10:09,326
By God, by God, I haven't seen it!

28
00:10:13,735 --> 00:10:15,362
It hurts!

29
00:10:22,978 --> 00:10:28,211
I don't know where the gold
is; it probably was stolen.

30
00:10:30,018 --> 00:10:33,818
Your Tatars must have
taken it. You're all thieves.

31
00:10:35,223 --> 00:10:37,885
Ask around your own men.

32
00:10:46,802 --> 00:10:48,793
He hasn't told the truth.

33
00:10:49,204 --> 00:10:51,672
Come here, I'll tell you something.

34
00:10:52,607 --> 00:10:58,512
See how the devils torture
an innocent Russian believer.

35
00:10:58,847 --> 00:11:05,946
Look, you Judas, you dirty Tatar!

36
00:11:06,321 --> 00:11:08,084
You lie, I'm Russian.

37
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:11,657
I recognize you. You
resemble your brother.

38
00:11:13,295 --> 00:11:15,559
You've sold Russia!
I recognized you!

39
00:13:04,005 --> 00:13:05,472
Mark my words!

40
00:13:06,608 --> 00:13:10,009
" No Tatar shall ever
set foot on Russian soil."

41
00:13:10,912 --> 00:13:13,710
This is my vow to the Lord.

42
00:13:15,217 --> 00:13:19,085
Give me a cross. Let a
believer kiss the cross.

43
00:13:19,254 --> 00:13:22,849
You'll get your cross.

44
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:28,228
If I have sinned, may God
forgive me. God is merciful.

45
00:13:29,097 --> 00:13:32,225
Lord, will you pardon me?

46
00:13:33,735 --> 00:13:37,637
But all of you will boil in pitch.

47
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,845
You will leave and
we will rebuild again...

48
00:13:46,514 --> 00:13:51,918
...but your guts will
go to the fires of hell.

49
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,882
What are you doing this for?

50
00:19:29,924 --> 00:19:33,724
Theophanes? But you are dead.

51
00:19:42,503 --> 00:19:44,937
I wanted to see you so much.

52
00:19:45,006 --> 00:19:48,271
Even if you had not wanted,
I would have come anyway.

53
00:19:49,811 --> 00:19:54,441
I dreamed you were suspended
in a window with your head down.

54
00:19:55,283 --> 00:19:58,116
You look in, and wag
your finger at me...

55
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,354
...and I'm lying across a saddle...

56
00:20:04,392 --> 00:20:06,622
...and two Tatars twist my head.

57
00:20:07,095 --> 00:20:10,826
And you look at me,
and tap on the window.

58
00:20:13,534 --> 00:20:15,468
And I cry out to you.

59
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,628
What do you cry?

60
00:20:20,174 --> 00:20:22,108
What's happening to us?

61
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:24,641
We are being murdered and raped.

62
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,981
Together with Tatars,
they are pillaging churches.

63
00:20:31,285 --> 00:20:33,219
And you said to me...

64
00:20:38,026 --> 00:20:42,963
Only now I'm worse off than you.

65
00:20:44,265 --> 00:20:46,062
You're dead, but I...

66
00:20:47,869 --> 00:20:52,306
Dead? What of it?

67
00:20:52,373 --> 00:20:53,362
I didn't mean that.

68
00:20:54,676 --> 00:21:00,342
I've spent half my life in blindness.

69
00:21:02,517 --> 00:21:07,113
I worked for people day and night.

70
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:24,761
But they aren't people, are they?

71
00:21:30,278 --> 00:21:32,371
What you said was true.

72
00:21:37,085 --> 00:21:39,053
So what if I said it then?

73
00:21:40,455 --> 00:21:43,424
You are wrong now,
I was wrong then.

74
00:21:44,525 --> 00:21:47,221
But haven't we the same faith...

75
00:21:47,295 --> 00:21:49,354
...the same land...

76
00:21:50,598 --> 00:21:51,860
...the same blood?

77
00:21:56,771 --> 00:21:58,568
One Tatar even smiled.

78
00:22:05,313 --> 00:22:06,302
Like this!

79
00:22:10,818 --> 00:22:11,807
And shouted:

80
00:22:13,054 --> 00:22:17,115
" Even without us you'll
cut each other's throats!"

81
00:22:19,961 --> 00:22:21,656
What a disgrace.

82
00:22:23,965 --> 00:22:26,024
They killed everyone.

83
00:22:28,636 --> 00:22:30,365
Even my Seryoga.

84
00:22:32,874 --> 00:22:35,638
I found him on such a special day.

85
00:22:40,081 --> 00:22:42,641
She is the only one that survived.

86
00:22:57,732 --> 00:23:00,166
It's time for me to go.

87
00:23:00,635 --> 00:23:01,932
Wait.

88
00:23:04,438 --> 00:23:09,205
Don't go. Don't you like
being with me; are you bored?

89
00:23:10,378 --> 00:23:12,175
All right, I won't...

90
00:23:13,214 --> 00:23:17,207
Let's sit and talk. I'll tell you...

91
00:23:18,052 --> 00:23:20,179
But I already know everything.

92
00:23:22,023 --> 00:23:24,753
Then you know I'll never paint again.

93
00:23:28,529 --> 00:23:29,621
Why so?

94
00:23:30,298 --> 00:23:33,131
Because it's of no use
to anyone. That's all.

95
00:23:34,368 --> 00:23:37,565
So what? Your
iconostasis was burned.

96
00:23:38,339 --> 00:23:42,776
Do you know how many of mine
they burned? In Pskov, Novgorod...

97
00:23:44,445 --> 00:23:46,913
You are committing a grave sin.

98
00:23:48,449 --> 00:23:51,179
I haven't told you the worst.

99
00:23:55,223 --> 00:23:56,918
I killed a man.

100
00:24:04,131 --> 00:24:05,826
A fellow Russian.

101
00:24:11,205 --> 00:24:13,196
When I saw him carrying her off.

102
00:24:15,843 --> 00:24:17,208
Look at her.

103
00:24:17,945 --> 00:24:19,845
Just look at her!

104
00:24:22,984 --> 00:24:24,315
I don't remember how it happened.

105
00:24:25,086 --> 00:24:27,350
I caught up with him...

106
00:24:28,856 --> 00:24:30,084
...and I couldn't help it.

107
00:24:30,258 --> 00:24:33,625
Through our sins, evil
has assumed human form.

108
00:24:34,495 --> 00:24:38,363
Encroaching evil means
encroaching humanity.

109
00:24:40,501 --> 00:24:43,163
God will forgive you;
don't forgive yourself.

110
00:24:43,938 --> 00:24:49,069
Live, between divine
forgiveness and your own torment.

111
00:24:50,645 --> 00:24:54,547
As for your sins, what
do your scriptures say?

112
00:24:57,418 --> 00:25:01,718
" Learn to do good: seek justice...

113
00:25:03,224 --> 00:25:06,716
" ...rebuke the oppressor, defend
the fatherless, plead for the widow.

114
00:25:07,695 --> 00:25:11,688
"Come now, and let us reason
together, saith the Lord...

115
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,060
" ...though your sins be as scarlet...

116
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:19,801
" ...they shall be as white as snow."

117
00:25:23,377 --> 00:25:28,747
See, I haven't forgotten;
that may comfort you.

118
00:25:29,917 --> 00:25:33,114
I know, God is merciful
and will pardon me.

119
00:25:34,822 --> 00:25:37,620
I shall offer the Lord
a vow of silence.

120
00:25:41,662 --> 00:25:44,859
I have nothing more
to say to people.

121
00:25:47,835 --> 00:25:49,769
Is this a good idea?

122
00:25:50,404 --> 00:25:53,601
I have no right to advise you.

123
00:25:55,476 --> 00:25:57,467
Didn't you go to heaven?

124
00:25:57,945 --> 00:25:58,809
Lord!

125
00:26:00,548 --> 00:26:04,609
I can only say it is not as
you imagine it on earth.

126
00:26:06,887 --> 00:26:08,514
Russia, Russia!

127
00:26:10,591 --> 00:26:15,290
Our mother country suffers
all; she will endure all.

128
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:21,494
But how long will this go on?

129
00:26:26,474 --> 00:26:29,466
I don't know. Forever, most likely.

130
00:26:33,047 --> 00:26:35,379
Yet how beautiful all this is.

131
00:26:46,193 --> 00:26:47,421
It's snowing.

132
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:56,966
Nothing is more terrible
than snow falling in a temple.

133
00:27:54,195 --> 00:27:59,258
THE CHARITY
Winter 1412

134
00:30:44,265 --> 00:30:46,358
The apples are all rotten.

135
00:30:49,303 --> 00:30:54,366
In all my years, I've
never seen such a famine.

136
00:30:55,009 --> 00:30:57,569
We are slowly dying out.
Lord have pity on us.

137
00:31:00,814 --> 00:31:03,305
Mefody is bringing someone again.

138
00:31:12,426 --> 00:31:15,725
Mefody, you should not
be the gate-keeper...

139
00:31:15,896 --> 00:31:18,763
...because you will let the whole
neighborhood in here to eat.

140
00:31:20,067 --> 00:31:22,194
- Sit down, man of God.
- Thank you.

141
00:31:22,269 --> 00:31:23,531
To eat!

142
00:31:25,606 --> 00:31:29,235
You can't feed all the hungry people.

143
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,275
There is no one in the neighborhood.

144
00:31:35,616 --> 00:31:37,174
The villages are deserted.

145
00:31:42,256 --> 00:31:44,884
Everyone has left Khotkovo.

146
00:31:47,461 --> 00:31:49,895
The people of Semyonovka have fled.

147
00:31:50,197 --> 00:31:51,664
They've fled, they've fled!

148
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:54,094
It's true. I passed
Semyonovka this morning.

149
00:31:54,335 --> 00:31:56,599
In Vladimir it is even worse.

150
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:59,998
No harvest for three
years; everyone has fled.

151
00:32:00,074 --> 00:32:02,338
Those who stayed are eating mice.

152
00:32:02,776 --> 00:32:03,765
Why are you whispering?

153
00:32:03,877 --> 00:32:06,675
I'm not whispering. I have a
cold. I spent a night in a lake.

154
00:32:07,081 --> 00:32:08,309
Why was that?

155
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:14,381
Wolves chased me; I fled to the
lake, praying they wouldn't follow.

156
00:32:15,022 --> 00:32:19,049
I was standing like that till dawn.

157
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,287
When I got out, I
was completely numb.

158
00:32:21,362 --> 00:32:23,956
I've been sick for two weeks
and I'm shivering all over.

159
00:32:24,331 --> 00:32:26,993
- So you're from Vladimir.
- I used to live there.

160
00:32:28,235 --> 00:32:30,135
Someone else from Vladimir is here.

161
00:32:31,372 --> 00:32:34,307
Andrei Rublev. Have
you heard of him?

162
00:32:35,075 --> 00:32:38,272
He has sinned, and
now he is atoning.

163
00:32:39,646 --> 00:32:41,637
He has brought a holy
fool with him from Vladimir.

164
00:32:42,416 --> 00:32:43,849
A mute girl.

165
00:32:44,385 --> 00:32:47,752
Now they are silent together.

166
00:32:55,529 --> 00:33:00,296
Though she is a holy fool, she
knows where to get better food.

167
00:33:01,301 --> 00:33:03,166
He has brought her...

168
00:33:03,437 --> 00:33:06,565
...so that he may
always remember his sin.

169
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:12,544
Can you call it holiness?

170
00:33:15,849 --> 00:33:17,407
And Rublev's guild?

171
00:33:18,085 --> 00:33:20,053
It fell apart.

172
00:33:21,054 --> 00:33:23,488
Some were killed by Tatars...

173
00:33:25,058 --> 00:33:27,526
...others were driven away.

174
00:33:28,228 --> 00:33:29,422
Is Danil alive?

175
00:33:30,364 --> 00:33:34,892
Some say he went
north, others say he died.

176
00:33:35,769 --> 00:33:38,329
So he's given up his craft?

177
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:40,170
Aren't you Kirill?

178
00:33:46,246 --> 00:33:48,214
Kirill, is it you?

179
00:34:05,065 --> 00:34:09,024
Father! Master! Kirill has come back!

180
00:34:14,374 --> 00:34:19,402
Father! Let your
prodigal son Kirill back in!

181
00:34:22,282 --> 00:34:24,011
You didn't ask me
if you could leave...

182
00:34:24,084 --> 00:34:25,346
...and now you want to come back?

183
00:34:25,552 --> 00:34:27,543
You didn't like it in the secular world?

184
00:34:28,388 --> 00:34:30,413
No, I won't take you in.

185
00:34:30,491 --> 00:34:33,153
My God, why hast thou forsaken me?

186
00:34:33,227 --> 00:34:37,095
Now you want back
into the den of thieves...

187
00:34:37,397 --> 00:34:39,888
...to the money-changers
and dove-sellers.

188
00:34:40,267 --> 00:34:43,259
You think because I am old,
I have forgotten about it.

189
00:34:43,871 --> 00:34:45,532
Begone! Go back to
where you came from!

190
00:34:45,606 --> 00:34:46,903
There is no place for you here!

191
00:34:46,974 --> 00:34:48,737
Don't drive me away, for God's sake!

192
00:34:48,809 --> 00:34:51,107
There is no truth in the world.
The devil tempted me.

193
00:34:51,311 --> 00:34:53,404
I can't continue sinning...

194
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,675
...and without sin you cannot
live in the secular world.

195
00:34:55,749 --> 00:34:57,376
There is sin and dirt all around.

196
00:34:57,451 --> 00:35:01,615
Accept my penitence
and I will kiss your feet.

197
00:35:02,356 --> 00:35:06,554
You were always eloquent,
but you won't move me, Kirill.

198
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:10,894
If you knew how I've
suffered, what I've endured...

199
00:35:11,732 --> 00:35:15,031
...if you knew what evil I've
seen, you would forgive me...

200
00:35:15,536 --> 00:35:17,902
...but I will never forgive myself.

201
00:35:17,971 --> 00:35:21,270
You're not guilty before
me, but before God.

202
00:35:23,677 --> 00:35:28,410
Remain here; but
to expiate your sin...

203
00:35:28,482 --> 00:35:32,475
...you must copy out the
Scriptures fifteen times.

204
00:35:32,686 --> 00:35:34,950
Take the late Nikodim's cell.

205
00:35:35,822 --> 00:35:38,950
Thank you! Thank you, God!

206
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:44,397
How wonderful! Thank
you, Father, thank you!

207
00:39:12,873 --> 00:39:16,809
Hey, it's bad to eat dirty meat.

208
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,791
Brothers, what's going on?

209
00:39:42,869 --> 00:39:44,803
I'll go to tell Father Nikodim.

210
00:40:46,766 --> 00:40:49,462
A good Russian. She eats horsemeat.

211
00:40:50,503 --> 00:40:53,063
Do you want to come with
me? You'll be my wife.

212
00:40:57,811 --> 00:40:59,836
I have seven wives,
but no Russian wife.

213
00:41:01,047 --> 00:41:06,917
You will eat horsemeat every day,
drink horse milk, wear coins in hair.

214
00:42:05,745 --> 00:42:09,408
Russian wife for Tatar
husband is never dirty.

215
00:43:15,315 --> 00:43:18,409
Girl! Come with us!

216
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,327
Come! Give me your hand!

217
00:44:32,158 --> 00:44:34,854
Do you hear me, Andrei?

218
00:44:47,874 --> 00:44:49,432
Don't you recognize me?

219
00:45:15,802 --> 00:45:19,761
Don't grieve, they'll let her go.

220
00:45:21,441 --> 00:45:24,774
They won't dare harm
a holy fool. It's a sin.

221
00:46:01,314 --> 00:46:07,275
THE BELL
Spring-Summer-Autumn-
Winter-Spring 1423-1424

222
00:46:32,412 --> 00:46:34,573
Is this the home of
Nikolka, the bell-maker?

223
00:46:36,282 --> 00:46:37,442
It is.

224
00:46:37,884 --> 00:46:40,546
- Is he your father?
- Yes.

225
00:46:41,521 --> 00:46:42,920
Then call him.

226
00:46:44,691 --> 00:46:46,886
- He's not here.
- Where is he?

227
00:46:48,461 --> 00:46:49,723
He's dead.

228
00:46:51,297 --> 00:46:56,997
The plague took them
all: mother, sister, father.

229
00:46:58,104 --> 00:47:00,572
And where does Gavrila
the bell-maker live?

230
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,476
Gavrila? He's dead, too.

231
00:47:05,445 --> 00:47:10,348
So is Kasian, and the Tatars
led lvashka away last year.

232
00:47:11,284 --> 00:47:14,742
Only Fyodor is left.
Go to him; the fifth hut.

233
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:20,620
But you should hurry; Fyodor's
in bed with the plague.

234
00:47:21,961 --> 00:47:24,555
He can't open his eyes. He
will pass away at any moment.

235
00:47:33,806 --> 00:47:39,108
I can't stand it any more. Where
else can we look? Let's go home.

236
00:47:40,613 --> 00:47:43,707
Get up. You aren't going home.

237
00:47:48,221 --> 00:47:51,554
Is there no one left to cast the bell?

238
00:47:53,192 --> 00:47:55,592
Take me with you.

239
00:47:58,798 --> 00:48:00,698
Let me cast the bell for you.

240
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:02,226
Are you mad, boy?

241
00:48:02,302 --> 00:48:03,633
Take me to the Prince.

242
00:48:04,837 --> 00:48:07,431
Honestly, I can make
everything very well for you.

243
00:48:08,408 --> 00:48:13,641
You won't find anyone better
than me; they're all dead.

244
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:15,008
Go to hell!

245
00:48:15,081 --> 00:48:21,850
Okay! But I know the secret
of bell-making, and I won't tell.

246
00:48:21,921 --> 00:48:22,910
What are you saying?

247
00:48:22,989 --> 00:48:26,584
I know the secret. My father
knew the secret of bell-making.

248
00:48:26,659 --> 00:48:32,529
Before he died, he passed it to
me. No one else knows, except me.

249
00:48:34,233 --> 00:48:39,466
My father died and
passed me the secret.

250
00:48:41,641 --> 00:48:43,199
Shall we take him?

251
00:48:43,743 --> 00:48:45,267
What secret?

252
00:48:46,145 --> 00:48:49,239
Do you want the Prince to flay us?

253
00:48:49,916 --> 00:48:51,816
He's lying about the secret.

254
00:48:52,118 --> 00:48:53,710
The worse for him!

255
00:48:54,087 --> 00:48:56,817
- What is your name?
- Boriska.

256
00:48:56,956 --> 00:48:58,116
Come here!

257
00:49:04,564 --> 00:49:06,054
Mount!

258
00:49:13,639 --> 00:49:14,970
What about the hut?

259
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:19,878
Did you persuade him?

260
00:50:04,056 --> 00:50:05,455
Shall we dig here?

261
00:50:05,858 --> 00:50:07,382
We can do it here.

262
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,558
But it would be more convenient
to do it closer to the bell-tower...

263
00:50:10,663 --> 00:50:13,154
...so that we won't have to
drag this heavy thing far.

264
00:50:13,232 --> 00:50:15,928
Can't we dig here? Let's do it here.

265
00:50:21,674 --> 00:50:23,107
Mark it out.

266
00:50:26,579 --> 00:50:28,979
Let's dig together, shall we?

267
00:50:30,716 --> 00:50:34,311
We're bell-casters, not diggers.

268
00:50:34,554 --> 00:50:36,749
Why should we be digging?

269
00:50:36,823 --> 00:50:40,281
You know what my father said...

270
00:50:41,127 --> 00:50:44,153
...before he died?

271
00:50:45,031 --> 00:50:48,558
" Bell-casters must
dig the casting-pit."

272
00:50:49,035 --> 00:50:54,302
" I only understood that in my
old age," he said, and died.

273
00:50:56,142 --> 00:51:00,135
I don't know what Nikolka
said, but I'm not going to dig.

274
00:51:05,918 --> 00:51:07,647
Call us when you need us.

275
00:51:07,753 --> 00:51:10,221
Okay, I'll dig for you.

276
00:52:18,558 --> 00:52:19,547
Well?

277
00:52:21,861 --> 00:52:22,850
Did you find it?

278
00:52:23,296 --> 00:52:25,287
There is no need to
look for it. Here it is.

279
00:52:44,850 --> 00:52:48,081
No, it's not the right clay.

280
00:52:48,621 --> 00:52:51,215
- We always took it here.
- Then you are fools.

281
00:52:51,724 --> 00:52:52,748
The clay is very good.

282
00:52:53,292 --> 00:52:56,352
- Andreika, isn't the clay bad?
- Yes, it's bad.

283
00:52:56,462 --> 00:52:57,451
You see? Come on.

284
00:53:05,805 --> 00:53:07,773
We'll search until we find good clay.

285
00:53:15,381 --> 00:53:18,350
Stepan, perhaps we
shouldn't have done this.

286
00:53:18,417 --> 00:53:21,614
Come on. Look what
clay we have found.

287
00:53:21,687 --> 00:53:28,422
How hard we've worked, and
now we've found a new spot.

288
00:53:28,861 --> 00:53:31,022
It's not the right kind.

289
00:53:32,965 --> 00:53:36,992
It's the end of August, and we
have not found the clay yet.

290
00:53:37,937 --> 00:53:39,768
Think about yourself.
I'm sorry for you.

291
00:53:39,872 --> 00:53:43,638
I've managed all these
years without your pity.

292
00:53:45,277 --> 00:53:46,767
Let's go back, Boriska.

293
00:53:47,546 --> 00:53:49,980
I can't. I know that's not the right clay.

294
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:52,308
Then what is right?

295
00:53:52,685 --> 00:53:53,674
I know what it is.

296
00:53:59,392 --> 00:54:01,553
I don't need people like you.

297
00:54:02,428 --> 00:54:04,123
I can manage without you.

298
00:54:04,864 --> 00:54:06,195
I don't need such people!

299
00:55:10,396 --> 00:55:11,522
Andreika!

300
00:55:13,466 --> 00:55:14,899
Semyon!

301
00:55:16,802 --> 00:55:18,997
I have found it!

302
00:55:23,008 --> 00:55:27,240
Uncle Fyodor! I've found it!

303
00:55:30,549 --> 00:55:34,144
The clay! Uncle Seymon!

304
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,017
Stepan!

305
00:55:38,157 --> 00:55:40,591
We've found the good clay, Stepan!

306
00:55:41,861 --> 00:55:43,328
Here is the clay!

307
00:55:43,863 --> 00:55:45,797
I have found the clay, Stepan!

308
00:55:52,271 --> 00:55:54,171
Andreika! Andreika!

309
00:55:58,844 --> 00:56:00,641
Where are you all?

310
00:56:11,390 --> 00:56:14,518
Boriska! Boriska!

311
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:16,719
- What?
- Shall I dig in?

312
00:56:16,829 --> 00:56:17,853
I'm coming.

313
00:56:18,898 --> 00:56:19,956
What are you saying?

314
00:56:20,032 --> 00:56:21,226
I'm coming!

315
00:56:22,201 --> 00:56:23,190
Where's Nikolai?

316
00:56:23,269 --> 00:56:24,668
He left this morning to fetch wood.

317
00:56:25,004 --> 00:56:28,235
- It should be here already.
- He'll be back by evening.

318
00:56:28,974 --> 00:56:30,566
The evening? I need
to reinforce it now.

319
00:56:31,443 --> 00:56:35,277
To the devil with your
Nikolai, he's an idiot.

320
00:56:36,248 --> 00:56:39,081
Why are you standing there? Work!

321
00:56:46,058 --> 00:56:49,050
- The merchants don't agree.
- What do you mean?

322
00:56:49,128 --> 00:56:50,618
They have tripled the price.

323
00:56:51,163 --> 00:56:53,063
They say it's still cheap.

324
00:56:53,132 --> 00:56:54,326
Buy it. What else can we do?

325
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,560
Buy it at this price?

326
00:56:55,634 --> 00:56:57,124
Buy, I say!

327
00:56:57,203 --> 00:57:00,104
The Prince will flay
you. We'll ruin him.

328
00:57:00,539 --> 00:57:02,268
I no longer care. Buy it.

329
00:57:05,978 --> 00:57:08,913
You're in the way,
Father. It's dangerous.

330
00:57:09,982 --> 00:57:11,745
Don't dig in without me.

331
00:57:15,187 --> 00:57:17,917
- Boriska!
- Just one moment.

332
00:57:20,793 --> 00:57:23,284
The cast won't hold;
it needs another layer.

333
00:57:23,896 --> 00:57:26,330
Another layer? You should
have applied the clay already.

334
00:57:26,932 --> 00:57:29,162
You haven't put up the frame yet!

335
00:57:29,235 --> 00:57:31,396
It needs reinforcing, but
there are no more twigs.

336
00:57:32,171 --> 00:57:36,938
We're not going to reinforce
it. We start firing tonight.

337
00:57:37,009 --> 00:57:38,340
Is he kidding?

338
00:57:39,011 --> 00:57:41,502
If we don't reinforce
the cast, it won't hold.

339
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:43,275
It will crack and our
work will be wasted.

340
00:57:43,349 --> 00:57:47,080
If it snows and we can't fire,
won't our work be wasted, too?

341
00:57:48,087 --> 00:57:49,179
They'll flog me, not you.

342
00:57:50,222 --> 00:57:51,951
The cast won't hold like this.

343
00:57:53,525 --> 00:57:54,958
Apply the clay.

344
00:57:57,296 --> 00:57:58,456
Do you hear me?

345
00:58:00,532 --> 00:58:02,124
I won't do it.

346
00:58:03,068 --> 00:58:07,027
You won't? Then get out!
Andreika, apply the clay.

347
00:58:08,307 --> 00:58:10,502
He won't do it, either.

348
00:58:11,043 --> 00:58:12,340
Are you going to apply the clay?

349
00:58:12,411 --> 00:58:13,969
The metal will burst the mold.

350
00:58:14,713 --> 00:58:15,873
It needs reinforcement.

351
00:58:16,415 --> 00:58:20,010
Will you obey me?
Who is in charge here?

352
00:58:20,719 --> 00:58:22,414
It needs reinforcement.

353
00:58:31,263 --> 00:58:33,731
Flog him! He refuses to work.

354
00:58:36,969 --> 00:58:39,267
He won't obey my orders.

355
00:58:39,972 --> 00:58:41,599
I'll show you who's in charge!

356
00:58:42,174 --> 00:58:43,766
Your father treated us better.

357
00:58:44,543 --> 00:58:47,239
You remember him? Then
flog him in my father's name.

358
00:58:51,116 --> 00:58:52,708
All right, apply the clay.

359
00:58:59,692 --> 00:59:01,421
Start the work without me.

360
00:59:02,061 --> 00:59:03,494
But we're waiting for you.

361
00:59:03,929 --> 00:59:05,294
Start without me.

362
00:59:09,468 --> 00:59:11,231
Rest, sleep a little.

363
00:59:19,745 --> 00:59:22,043
Why are you staring at me?

364
00:59:27,853 --> 00:59:31,016
Lost your tongue? Are you deaf?

365
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:43,258
Are you sorry for him?

366
00:59:46,338 --> 00:59:52,208
Go and console him;
that's what a monk is for.

367
00:59:57,850 --> 01:00:00,580
O Lord. O Queen of Heaven...

368
01:01:04,349 --> 01:01:12,449
I can't understand how the Grand
Prince trusted him with all this.

369
01:01:22,686 --> 01:01:25,416
Boriska! Wake up!

370
01:01:28,992 --> 01:01:30,152
I've started the firing.

371
01:01:30,928 --> 01:01:33,158
Why did you start without me?

372
01:01:34,831 --> 01:01:36,822
I told you to wake me.

373
01:01:42,973 --> 01:01:45,203
Only I know when to start.

374
01:01:45,809 --> 01:01:50,303
Fyodor, the Prince's men have
come, and they want to see you.

375
01:02:01,525 --> 01:02:02,924
What heat!

376
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:11,292
What heat!

377
01:02:33,824 --> 01:02:35,189
That's enough.

378
01:02:41,932 --> 01:02:46,198
Not enough silver; tell the
Prince not to be so miserly.

379
01:02:47,137 --> 01:02:48,502
Our Grand Prince is never miserly.

380
01:02:48,872 --> 01:02:51,466
I don't care. I need another
eighteen pounds of silver.

381
01:02:52,042 --> 01:02:55,205
What's eighteen pounds
of silver, more or less?

382
01:02:55,879 --> 01:02:58,473
Who knows the secret
of bell-casting, I or you?

383
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:03,212
Tell the Prince not to be miserly.
We need another sixteen pounds.

384
01:03:03,654 --> 01:03:04,643
Are you mad?

385
01:03:05,022 --> 01:03:07,650
I'll get all the silver I
want from the Prince.

386
01:03:12,229 --> 01:03:14,857
Imagine, if after this it doesn't ring!

387
01:03:20,203 --> 01:03:21,932
Watch out.

388
01:03:39,289 --> 01:03:40,847
I recognize him!

389
01:03:40,924 --> 01:03:44,451
Beat him! Beat him!

390
01:03:48,598 --> 01:03:52,432
Are you mad? To
attack someone like that.

391
01:03:53,937 --> 01:03:56,371
You've mistaken him for another.

392
01:03:57,474 --> 01:04:00,534
I'm not mistaken. I
recognize you, Judas.

393
01:04:01,545 --> 01:04:05,413
How handsome he used to be
then. Now he has lost his looks.

394
01:04:06,416 --> 01:04:09,783
Thanks to him, I spent
ten years in prison...

395
01:04:10,921 --> 01:04:13,719
...and they cut off half my tongue.

396
01:04:14,358 --> 01:04:16,417
I'll kill him!

397
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:24,460
I'll kill him!

398
01:04:25,335 --> 01:04:26,597
I'll kill him!

399
01:04:35,545 --> 01:04:37,911
He's innocent, brother.
He's betrayed no one.

400
01:04:38,915 --> 01:04:42,646
I swear it by the Holy Cross.
Lord, why this punishment?

401
01:04:46,757 --> 01:04:49,885
Strike me, but don't touch him.

402
01:04:51,628 --> 01:04:52,617
Get up.

403
01:05:00,904 --> 01:05:02,462
You're heavy.

404
01:05:04,508 --> 01:05:07,341
The Prince's jester died.

405
01:05:08,712 --> 01:05:13,411
They wanted me to go, but
I'd rather be a carpenter.

406
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:18,178
I recognize him.

407
01:05:20,323 --> 01:05:22,257
He denounced me.

408
01:05:24,561 --> 01:05:26,495
Give me something to drink.

409
01:05:55,826 --> 01:05:58,659
There are worse things than that.

410
01:06:13,009 --> 01:06:15,239
Andreika, stand aside.

411
01:06:27,891 --> 01:06:29,882
Why stand there? Work!

412
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,100
Add some more, add
some more! Come on!

413
01:06:41,137 --> 01:06:42,069
Boriska, where is he?

414
01:06:52,249 --> 01:06:54,342
Boriska, where is he?

415
01:07:09,533 --> 01:07:12,161
Boriska, the second furnace is ready.

416
01:07:20,777 --> 01:07:22,335
Go, go! We're all ready.

417
01:07:27,918 --> 01:07:29,044
Open!

418
01:07:50,574 --> 01:07:53,441
Everything is ready. Shall we begin?

419
01:07:54,444 --> 01:07:55,911
Come on!

420
01:08:02,385 --> 01:08:03,477
It's coming, Boriska!
It's coming! It's coming.

421
01:08:06,189 --> 01:08:10,057
It's coming, Boriska!
It's coming! It's coming.

422
01:08:18,702 --> 01:08:20,397
God, help me.

423
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:07,093
What a day tomorrow will be!

424
01:12:10,099 --> 01:12:11,964
We should get some sleep.

425
01:12:21,811 --> 01:12:24,803
Boriska! Let's go, shall we?

426
01:12:26,316 --> 01:12:27,647
Just a moment.

427
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:20,134
This is what happened, Andrei.

428
01:13:25,808 --> 01:13:29,505
I've thought it over and
I've decided to tell you.

429
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:34,675
You know how much I envied.
Envy just gnawed at me.

430
01:13:35,518 --> 01:13:38,419
It was inside me like a poison.

431
01:13:39,422 --> 01:13:42,482
I couldn't stand it any longer, that's
why I left. I left because of you.

432
01:13:43,493 --> 01:13:47,293
When I heard you had given
up painting, the envy went.

433
01:13:48,364 --> 01:13:50,855
My heart grew lighter. Then I forgot.

434
01:13:51,868 --> 01:13:54,837
I only want to copy the
Scriptures before I die.

435
01:13:55,471 --> 01:13:56,733
The Father Superior is strict...

436
01:13:56,806 --> 01:13:59,434
...and his punishment is
not easy in my old age.

437
01:13:59,509 --> 01:14:01,807
I'm afraid I won't have
enough time to finish my task.

438
01:14:03,012 --> 01:14:06,948
Why am I repenting? Why
should I repent to you?

439
01:14:07,016 --> 01:14:10,008
You yourself are a
greater sinner than I.

440
01:14:10,353 --> 01:14:12,014
Yes, yes, greater than I.

441
01:14:12,155 --> 01:14:15,488
What am I? A humble worm;
nothing is demanded of me.

442
01:14:15,558 --> 01:14:17,890
But you, what are you?

443
01:14:18,361 --> 01:14:22,024
For what sacred deed did
God give you your talent?

444
01:14:22,098 --> 01:14:23,929
For what did you deserve it?

445
01:14:24,067 --> 01:14:26,695
Lord, I don't want to say this.

446
01:14:28,037 --> 01:14:30,665
I know Nikon has sent a
third messenger to you...

447
01:14:30,740 --> 01:14:33,368
...to persuade you to come
back to paint the Trinity.

448
01:14:33,443 --> 01:14:36,503
And you sent them all back.
You wouldn't even talk to them.

449
01:14:36,813 --> 01:14:38,508
I'll tell you the truth. I won't lie.

450
01:14:38,581 --> 01:14:41,846
Then, in my dirty soul,
there, in the very depth of it...

451
01:14:41,918 --> 01:14:44,978
...there was a tiny flicker of joy.

452
01:14:45,054 --> 01:14:46,817
And now...

453
01:14:48,257 --> 01:14:52,125
...my life is ending;
my soul calls out for rest.

454
01:14:53,696 --> 01:14:55,721
Nikon doesn't care
a bit for your life.

455
01:14:56,733 --> 01:15:00,066
He wants you here, to glorify and
strengthen his power with your talent.

456
01:15:01,504 --> 01:15:03,438
Never mind Nikon, but listen to me.

457
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:07,705
Go to the Trinity Cathedral
and paint, paint, paint!

458
01:15:09,212 --> 01:15:13,649
Don't burden your soul, for it is an
awful sin to deny the divine spark.

459
01:15:14,684 --> 01:15:18,484
If Theophanes were alive,
wouldn't he say the same thing?

460
01:15:20,523 --> 01:15:25,893
Look at me, look at the ungifted
one. Why do you think I returned?

461
01:15:26,029 --> 01:15:29,328
For a crust of bread, to
finish my life in peace.

462
01:15:29,565 --> 01:15:32,227
I shall die soon and
nothing will remain after me.

463
01:15:32,301 --> 01:15:33,700
And I know that I will die soon.

464
01:15:33,903 --> 01:15:36,030
Nor have you much longer to live.

465
01:15:36,372 --> 01:15:40,206
Do you want to take
your talent to the grave?

466
01:15:40,910 --> 01:15:45,108
Why are you silent, Andrei?
Give me at least one word.

467
01:15:45,948 --> 01:15:51,079
It was I who
denounced that jester then.

468
01:15:52,955 --> 01:15:56,482
Curse me, but don't
stay silent, Andrei.

469
01:15:59,062 --> 01:16:01,428
Curse me.

470
01:18:16,332 --> 01:18:17,629
Well, how is it?

471
01:18:21,170 --> 01:18:22,569
Come on, then.

472
01:18:25,374 --> 01:18:26,602
Everyone, get away!

473
01:18:33,349 --> 01:18:36,284
What's going on up there?

474
01:18:36,352 --> 01:18:37,944
Everything is okay.

475
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:39,817
Come on, come on! Everyone go up!

476
01:18:46,229 --> 01:18:47,287
Is everyone ready?

477
01:18:53,436 --> 01:18:56,963
Well? Come on.

478
01:19:10,319 --> 01:19:14,585
Go on. Give the signal.

479
01:19:27,737 --> 01:19:28,931
Come on!

480
01:21:18,514 --> 01:21:21,506
The Grand Prince is coming
with a foreign ambassador.

481
01:21:22,284 --> 01:21:23,581
Is everything ready?

482
01:21:23,652 --> 01:21:26,212
If not, watch out!

483
01:21:27,022 --> 01:21:28,683
Motherfucker!

484
01:22:44,133 --> 01:22:48,661
We bless and consecrate
this bell with holy water.

485
01:22:50,105 --> 01:22:53,268
In the name of the Father,
Son and Holy Ghost. Amen.

486
01:23:44,393 --> 01:23:46,793
Look what kind of people
are overseeing here.

487
01:23:55,804 --> 01:23:57,829
Where are you going?

488
01:24:03,979 --> 01:24:05,947
Isn't it rather peculiar?

489
01:24:07,082 --> 01:24:09,209
They're all peculiar here.

490
01:24:21,931 --> 01:24:24,092
Come on, come on, dumbbell!

491
01:24:40,282 --> 01:24:42,773
Shall I help you, or will
you touch it yourself?

492
01:25:09,445 --> 01:25:13,506
What do you think will
come out of all this travesty?

493
01:25:13,782 --> 01:25:15,010
What do you think?

494
01:25:15,317 --> 01:25:17,785
In my opinion, nothing
good will come out of this.

495
01:25:17,853 --> 01:25:22,483
Excuse me, Your Excellency, but I think
you are being deceived by appearances.

496
01:25:22,558 --> 01:25:25,493
Look at all of this!

497
01:25:25,594 --> 01:25:29,189
What do you think of this
dumb bell, this awkward scaffold?

498
01:25:29,264 --> 01:25:33,223
I would sum it up and
say this bell will not ring.

499
01:25:33,302 --> 01:25:35,099
In fact, it can't ring.

500
01:25:35,170 --> 01:25:37,365
Does Your Excellency
wish to make a wager?

501
01:25:37,439 --> 01:25:42,172
I think you underestimate the
situation these people are in.

502
01:25:42,244 --> 01:25:44,712
Besides, they were
the ones that built it.

503
01:25:44,847 --> 01:25:49,614
That may be true, but I wouldn't
venture to call that thing a bell.

504
01:25:49,685 --> 01:25:53,553
Excellency, they fully understand...

505
01:25:53,622 --> 01:25:57,615
...that the Prince will behead
them if it doesn't ring.

506
01:25:57,793 --> 01:26:00,728
Judging from the face of that youth...

507
01:26:00,796 --> 01:26:05,096
...one could say that he is
aware of the circumstances.

508
01:26:05,401 --> 01:26:06,800
Don't you think so?

509
01:26:08,404 --> 01:26:10,235
Excellency...

510
01:26:10,305 --> 01:26:14,503
...have you heard that the Grand
Prince beheaded his brother?

511
01:26:14,643 --> 01:26:16,406
It seems they were twins.

512
01:26:18,447 --> 01:26:22,110
Look at that marvelous girl! My God!

513
01:26:22,317 --> 01:26:25,411
My friend, that girl is not
more than thirteen years old.

514
01:26:25,754 --> 01:26:28,848
That doesn't make her less attractive.

515
01:26:28,924 --> 01:26:32,553
Sometimes these girls are
women at the age of thirteen.

516
01:26:33,495 --> 01:26:35,554
What's the matter with
you, Your Excellency?

517
01:29:04,179 --> 01:29:06,943
Come on, come on.

518
01:29:11,887 --> 01:29:15,755
My father, that old snake,
didn't pass on the secret.

519
01:29:16,792 --> 01:29:22,594
He died without telling me, he took
it to the grave. Skinflint scoundrel!

520
01:29:23,031 --> 01:29:26,523
You see, it's turned out very well.

521
01:29:26,602 --> 01:29:28,001
Come on, come on.

522
01:29:29,104 --> 01:29:31,937
Let's go together, you and I.

523
01:29:33,208 --> 01:29:35,142
You'll cast bells. I'll paint icons.

524
01:29:36,645 --> 01:29:39,205
We'll go to the Trinity
Monastery together.

525
01:29:41,116 --> 01:29:43,880
What a feast day for the people.

526
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:47,445
You've brought them such
joy, and you're crying.

527
01:29:48,223 --> 01:29:51,750
Come on, come on.

528
01:39:44,052 --> 01:39:50,981
THE END
