1
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,994
Yeah, uh, hello. You're Steve?

2
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,996
Steven. Steven. Hi.

3
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,374
- Sit down.
- Roberto?

4
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,922
- I'm all wound up,
- Yeah.

5
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:15,509
You're wound up? I'm wound up too.

6
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,678
- Yes.
- All wound up.

7
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,765
- Ahh... What are you drinking... coffee?
- Coffee. Yes

8
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,143
- very good for me, coffee. For you?
- I love coffee.

9
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,477
- You love it too?
- I Love it.

10
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,020
- Steve!
- Steven.

11
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,188
Steve...

12
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,649
I love coffee.

13
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,860
What do you do?

14
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:37,447
Oh, you know, I just relax, sit around,
maybe have a cigarette.

15
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:38,240
Yes?

16
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,951
Cigarettes and coffee,
I think go together good.

17
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:43,453
I don't know, you think
you drink too much of it?

18
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:46,456
No. Coffee is good for health, yeah?

19
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,876
I like to drink before I go to sleep.

20
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,004
I drink a lot of coffee before I go
to sleep. So I can dream faster.

21
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,882
I can dream, like when they put a camera
on the Indy 500...

22
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,468
when they put a camera in the car,
and it's just whipping by like that.

23
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,554
Dream after dream after dream after dream.

24
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,347
People ask me the next day,
what did you dream about?

25
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,726
I say, I don't have time.
I don't have time to tell you this.

26
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:16,904
- Do you smoke?
- Only when I drink... coffee.

27
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,323
Do you know my mother?

28
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,785
- Do I know your mother?
- Yeah.

29
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,954
I don't know, I don't think so.

30
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,541
- Coffee. They should freeze it, you know?
- Yes!

31
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:33,879
Fill an icecube tray with coffee
and put sticks in it, for kids, you know?

32
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:37,299
So they can start out when they're kids.
When they're playing, and stuff.

33
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:40,344
Like a popsicle. A caffeine popsicle.

34
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:43,347
Νery good. I don't understand nothing. Yes.

35
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,156
- Can you hear me?
- What?

36
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,242
Can you hear me? It's very loud over here.

37
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:07,120
You having trouble hearing me?
Maybe we should switch.

38
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:11,458
Yes, thank you very much.
I'd like to switch.

39
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,629
Ahh, good here.

40
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,347
- Good?
- I kinda liked it better over there.

41
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,392
- You go...
- Do you mind?

42
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,352
Yes, me, too. I prefer, yes.

43
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,191
- Steve...
- Steven.

44
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,401
Steve, yes.

45
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,582
- When do you leave?
- The United States?

46
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:53,542
No, here.

47
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:58,213
Here, oh... I have to leave, soon actually.
I have a dentist appointment.

48
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:03,844
But I don't want to go.
I don't like the dentist.

49
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,764
- Yeah.
- I gotta go. I guess.

50
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,226
- Yes.
- I haven't gone in a while.

51
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,063
Good. You don't go?

52
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:20,027
- I should go, but I don't feel like going.
- No?

53
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:27,492
Steve, I am free. Very free.

54
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,037
You wanna go for me?

55
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,997
Thank you very much.

56
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:34,416
- You want to go to the dentist?
- I can go for you.

57
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:35,542
Great.

58
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,212
- Here's the address.
- Good.

59
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:41,214
Good. Νery good.

60
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,467
- The name of the guy.
- Yeah, 4:30.

61
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:48,096
- Steven, thank you very much.
- No problem.

62
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,390
- You don't mind?
- No, thank you.

63
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,392
Dentist appointment. Very good.

64
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,688
I have to go. I am sorry, Steve.

65
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:57,856
Steven.

66
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,984
Steve, yeah I have to go to the dentist.
I am late.

67
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:05,197
- Thank you, excuse me. Sorry...
- Take it easy, don't be late.

68
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:10,160
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too, in a way.

69
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,790
What are we doing in Memphis, anyway?

70
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,751
- It was your idea to come here.
- Your idea.

71
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,878
It was my idea? It was your idea.

72
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,430
Νery funny.

73
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:21,231
Don't smoke those sawdust cigarettes
in here.

74
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:22,983
I hate those things.

75
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,152
- So what.
- What are you, a cowboy?

76
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,697
- These are fresh. This is fresh tobacco.
- No, this is fresh.

77
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:32,909
- This is the stupid dope fresh cigarettes.
- That stuff is stale. What are you, crazy?

78
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,456
- I'm not crazy.
- Shut up.

79
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,670
How we doing here? Need a refill?

80
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:44,838
- Yeah.
- No.

81
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:46,631
Sir?

82
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,467
- Yes.
- Oh yes.

83
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,851
- Hey!
- Shit! I'm sorry.

84
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:02,022
- Come on man, what are you doing, man?
- Damn, I'm sorry about that.

85
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:05,734
Let's not even pay the check.
This place is terrible.

86
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,196
This all you're going to have?
Just ahh...

87
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:11,698
- Give me a light.
- Just coffee and cigarettes?

88
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,366
That's not too healthy, is it now?

89
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,203
- Can I get you a sandwich or something?
- No.

90
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,539
- You all from around here?
- No.

91
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,125
Are you brother and sister?

92
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,335
- Yes.
- No.

93
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,297
Are you two twins?

94
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,465
- Yes.
- No.

95
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,050
Yes we are.

96
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,803
I thought so.
You know y'all remind me of?

97
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:36,348
- Who?
- Heckel and Jeckel.

98
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:38,391
Shit.

99
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,062
You know ahh... the talking magpies?

100
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:48,109
Anyway, who's the evil twin?
That's the way it works, right?

101
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,863
- This coffee tastes like mud.
- Really.

102
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,576
Which one of us do you think
looks like the evil one?

103
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:01,164
I'd say he's the evil one, right?
He's got the evil eye.

104
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,293
- I'm only kidding.
- You better be.

105
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:09,089
Hey, you know, I just thought of something,
with you two being twins and all.

106
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,425
- Y'all go to Graceland yet?
- No.

107
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,135
Oh, you should. It's real cool.

108
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,805
- Mind if I sit down?
- Yes I do.

109
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:19,599
Yes, you can sit down.
What are you, on a break?

110
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:24,104
No really, but it's kind of slow.
Tell you what, you can help me out.

111
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,107
Just stay right there. You got me covered
and my boss can't see me.

112
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,278
It's his evil nature, right?

113
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,948
Well anyway what I just thought of.

114
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,659
Do you know that
Elvis Presley's got a twin brother?

115
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:41,997
Yeah, his name is Jesse Garon.
You know, Elvis' middle name is Aron.

116
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:46,084
Aron, Garon. Anyway, everybody thinks
he died at birth, you know?

117
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,669
But my theory is...

118
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:51,369
that his mother didn't wanna raise two kids,
you know, she wasn't expecting twins.

119
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,508
She couldn't afford to raise them both,
she gave one away.

120
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:54,801
She just sent one off.

121
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:58,597
So he grew up, Jesse that is grew up
in Arkansas, or Mississippi, or something.

122
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:02,475
So he didn't know he had a brother, Elvis.
But one day, like 1968 or 69...

123
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,895
...he's looking at himself in the mirror
and says, "Damn, I look like Elvis."

124
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,648
So he comes to Memphis, looks up Elvis.

125
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:12,485
Elvis sees him, he says, Yeah, you're
my brother. I can't believe it!

126
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,238
How you doing? What can I do for you?

127
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,824
And his brother says, well I don't know.

128
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,744
Sure would be nice
to be you for one night.

129
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:24,956
So Elvis has this concert
where his brother sang.

130
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,126
They tried to see if
they could trick people.

131
00:10:27,151 --> 00:10:29,234
And damn if he didn't
sound like his brother.

132
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,546
Then Elvis had an idea.

133
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:34,924
Well? I'm kinda tired of the music scene.
I'll send him out on tour.

134
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:38,720
Big mistake! You see, cuz' it was his
brother who started to go to Vegas...

135
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:42,515
...and wear them big collars
and the white jumpsuits, and the capes.

136
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:46,227
Elvis wouldn't do that.
And it was his brother who got really fat.

137
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:49,856
You know, eating those
banana-fried butter sandwiches and all.

138
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,692
The Colonel said, man we gotta get rid
of this guy, you know?

139
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:53,860
He can't be Elvis anymore.

140
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:57,238
So they started feeding him pills.
I think they killed him.

141
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,701
So what? What are you saying?
What's the punch line?

142
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,375
- You all Elvis fans?
- No.

143
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:10,543
Oh.

144
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:14,506
You want to hear something about Elvis?
I'll tell you something about Elvis, okay?

145
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,634
- You ever heard of Otis Blackwell?
- No ma'am.

146
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:20,679
- You ever heard of Junior Parker?
- No ma'am.

147
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:24,599
Yeah, I didn't think so.
You know, Elvis robbed their music, man.

148
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:28,353
He paid them ten bucks for their music,
and all these other black musicians, too.

149
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:32,107
- That's what I think of Elvis.
- See now, here's where my theory fits.

150
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,567
I don't think it was Elvis.
I think it was his brother.

151
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,945
Oh, so in that case, it's alright, huh?

152
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:43,410
My favorite Elvis quote is, "The only thing
coloreds can do for me is shine my shoes."

153
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:49,582
I don't think The King said that.
See, I think it was his evil twin.

154
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,337
Danny, what you doing over there?
You got tables to wait on. Come on.

155
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,923
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah, don't get fired, man.

156
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,049
Danny!

157
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,510
Slap-happy hillbilly.

158
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:02,595
Cheers.

159
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,976
Something smells funny in here.

160
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,188
Hey!

161
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,567
Is that my shirt you got on?

162
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,155
No, I don't think so.

163
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,782
Yeah, I think it is.
This doesn't smell like me.

164
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,117
Yeah? What do you smell like?

165
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,161
I smell like me,
and this doesn't smell like me.

166
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,872
- I smell like me too.
- But this smells like you.

167
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,999
That's because I am me.

168
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,626
Is that my shirt?

169
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,212
- Why are you always copying me anyway?
- No. I'm not copying you.

170
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:39,132
- Why don't you get your own style?
- I have my own style.

171
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:42,802
No, you're always copying me. Your style
is my style, because you copy it.

172
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,971
- It's my style.
- No it's not your style.

173
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,640
Service is bad, coffee is bad, music sucks.

174
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,142
Hey. Those are my shoes!

175
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,986
- Those are my shoes.
- Those are my shoes...

176
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:53,271
- Those are my shoes.
- Those are my other shoes.

177
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,397
Bullshit.

178
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,115
- Hey.
- Hey Tom.

179
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,785
- Alright...
- Alright, I'm glad you could make it.

180
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,454
- You are here.
- Yeah.

181
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:54,374
Yeah, hey you know you can call me Jim.

182
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:59,003
I mean, you know, my friends call me Jim,
Jimmy or Iggy... or Jiggy.

183
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,881
Call me J... Call me Iggy.
Call me Iggy. Yeah.

184
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:06,052
OK. Alright, which ever way you go,
I'll go either way, Jim or Iggy...

185
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,638
Iggy. You call me Iggy.

186
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:13,852
Look, I'm sorry I'm late Jim.
Boy, whoo, four car pile-up.

187
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,814
I delivered a baby this morning at
about 9 o'clock.

188
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:21,150
I was saving lives,
I was out there on the highway, it was...

189
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,612
You know there's nothing worse than
roadside surgery.

190
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:28,366
You know, you don't have your own tools,
and it's just, it's murder.

191
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,745
I performed a tracheotomy
with a ballpoint pen...

192
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,040
I've been busy.

193
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,962
Wait a minute, you're a doctor?

194
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:45,008
Yeah. Yeah, I'm a doctor.

195
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,096
Music and medicine really,
it's really been my thing...

196
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:54,684
...it's combining the two and
living in that place where they overlap.

197
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,751
A lot of people say it shows up in
the music, you know, I don't know.

198
00:14:58,776 --> 00:14:59,713
I mean it's...

199
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,441
- Well yeah, okay...
- Yeah?

200
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,568
- Yeah I can see that.
- Yeah. Yeah?

201
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,445
Wow! Yeah, okay.

202
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:09,741
I can... The organization and the whole
thing. And the humanity, I guess...

203
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:13,411
The humanity of the thing. Sure.
The "regard."

204
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,330
- Yeah. The regard.
- Ahh...

205
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,124
Well I guess it was a big day for you then.

206
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,834
Yes, it was a medical morning.

207
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,378
- Everybody's alright?
- Everybody's fine.

208
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,799
- Well...
- You've been here awhile, I see.

209
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,886
Yeah, I've been here.
Drinking a little coffee.

210
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,305
- Yeah, I see.
- I ordered you some.

211
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,017
You ordered for me?

212
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,395
I mean, is it cool, is that cool?

213
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,775
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Coffee, yeah...

214
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,945
- I could go for coffee.
- Okay man.

215
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,489
Come on, have some coffee. Yeah.

216
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,868
Okay, coffee it is.

217
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,099
Those your cigarettes?

218
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,977
No. No, they were just sitting here
when I got here.

219
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,939
- You don't smoke do you?
- Nah. I gave it up.

220
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,774
- Me either. Oh boy.
- Enough of that.

221
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:28,403
That was enough. 25 big ones. Oh boy.

222
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:29,862
Finished.

223
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:33,199
- Got the energy now.
- Ohh... I feel great.

224
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:36,828
Boy, since I quit, I mean,
boy... just everything...

225
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:38,705
Yeah, you're focused.

226
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,749
- Zeroed in, bang! You know?
- Me too.

227
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:46,713
I feel sorry for suckers still
puffing away, you know?

228
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,841
- No willpower.
- No willpower. Pacifier...

229
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:58,558
You know the beauty of quitting is that,
now that I've quit...

230
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,478
...I can have one. Because I've quit.

231
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:09,402
You know, I mean it's like jewelry...
you know, it's not really...

232
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,280
I don't even inhale really.

233
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,658
You want to join me in one?

234
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,911
- Well yeah, since I quit. I mean...
- Yeah,

235
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,246
- Okay. Okay.
- Now that you've quit.

236
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,123
- You can have one.
- Yeah,

237
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:25,585
I can do that. Alright. Okay.

238
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,719
Hey boy, thank you!

239
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:38,473
You know what I mean?
Now that we've quit...

240
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:46,355
Hey, cigarettes and coffee, man.

241
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,441
That's a combination.

242
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,276
Can't beat it.

243
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:56,157
You know, we're really like the coffee and
cigarettes generation,

244
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,784
when you think about it.

245
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:02,914
I mean, in the 40's,
it was the pie and coffee generation.

246
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:08,377
Like Abbot and Costello on Tv, man!
They always wanted pie and coffee.

247
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:13,132
Yeah. Yeah, like Abbot and Costello!
They were always ordering pie and coffee.

248
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,259
Have some coffee!
Have some pie and coffee!

249
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,969
What are you waiting for?

250
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,061
You hang out here a lot?

251
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:30,483
Yeah. Yeah. This is my hangout.

252
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:35,363
Huh. I just wondered, because I didn't see
anything of yours on the jukebox.

253
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:44,330
Well, I mean if you don't like it here...

254
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:48,584
we could go down to Taco Bell or something.
Maybe that's more your style.

255
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,672
What are you saying, man?
You saying, like,

256
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,216
I'm like a Taco Bell kind of guy?

257
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:59,595
No. I mean, if... you don't like it here,
you said, you don't like it here.

258
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,014
No, no. I didn't... I didn't say that.

259
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,433
We could go to
the International House of Pancakes.

260
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,318
Maybe that's more up your alley.
I don't know.

261
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,812
I didn't say that. I mean,

262
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:10,523
I don't want to go to
the International House of Pancakes.

263
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,316
I'm comfortable.

264
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,536
Coffee is good though, at IHOP.

265
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,122
Oh, you like the coffee down there at IHOP?

266
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:34,839
I drink the coffee at IHOP. I like
the coffee. You don't like it?

267
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,257
Yeah. Yeah, man.

268
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,759
Hey, I like the IHOP coffee.

269
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:42,221
- Classy brew. Classy brew.
- Yeah. Yeah. That's good coffee.

270
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,434
Yeah, that's good coffee at the IHOP.

271
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:57,778
Wow, wow, I almost forgot. Listen.

272
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,907
I worked with this drummer
the other day in L.A.

273
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:04,410
And this guy, man, his name is Giant Robo.

274
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:08,414
And he's clangin' and bangin' and
really hard, Man,

275
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:09,498
I thought of you.

276
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,752
Maybe you wanna ch... This is somebody
I think you oughta check him out!

277
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:13,878
Oh yeah?

278
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:16,923
You mean, uhh...

279
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:21,135
you think I need a professional drummer?
Like I'm not good enough?

280
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,512
What are you talking about?

281
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,016
No. No. I'm just... You know.
It's a musician.

282
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:31,437
I thought, I just wanted to tell you
about this guy. It'd be great, man.

283
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:36,609
It's like, hard, and industrial,
and he's beating, and I just thought, wow.

284
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:43,449
What are you trying to tell me?
I need a drummer?

285
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:46,244
I could use a drummer?

286
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:50,331
The drumming on my record sucks?
What are you saying?

287
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:59,215
Ahh, forget it man. Forget it.

288
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:34,417
You know what?
I think I really gotta get going.

289
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:35,793
Oh you gotta go?

290
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:38,129
Maybe another cup?
Maybe another cig...

291
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:42,800
Boy, I'd like to. No. No... Gotta go.

292
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,635
I really gotta go. I mean...

293
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:50,391
My wife, she's alone, in a motel.

294
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,435
- Oh yeah...
- Yeah, you know...

295
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:56,272
Call her up, come on down here,
have a cup of coffee, couple of cigarettes.

296
00:21:58,191 --> 00:21:59,734
- She doesn't smoke.
- Oh.

297
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,486
- You know, it's the willpower.
- Oh I see.

298
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,488
- I don't wanna start her...
- No...

299
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,742
I don't want to get her started.
This is just our little thing here.

300
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,368
Yeah, right. Yeah...

301
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,788
Well, hey, Just sorta...

302
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,374
We can just keep zippin' along, you know.

303
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:20,338
I'll be thinkin'... I'll be
thinkin' of ya'. Gotta go.

304
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,381
Well, I guess so. Well...

305
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,383
See ya' soon.

306
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,010
Yeah, okay.

307
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,055
Wish you could stay a little longer.

308
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,723
Oh boy, I... I...

309
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,893
We were just starting to get going here.

310
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,561
Gotta go.

311
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,566
- Okay.
- Okay Jim.

312
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:43,402
- Next time.
- Okay, next time.

313
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,780
- Take care.
- You take care too.

314
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:12,598
He's not on here either.

315
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:16,412
- You're a fucking moron, you know that?
- Now what?

316
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,790
I can't believe that you're still smoking
those fucking things.

317
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:25,379
Νinny, they'll fuck you up.
They'll kill you. Believe me.

318
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,253
What, were you put on this fucking Earth
to annoy me?

319
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:32,553
You said you were going to quit,
instead, you spend a fortune.

320
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:36,182
So those big tobacco companies
can get fucking rich!

321
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,850
And then you get cancer...

322
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:41,896
And then the fucking doctors
and the hospitals, they can get rich.

323
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:43,731
And the undertakers too!

324
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:46,317
All because you want to smoke
like a fucking moron.

325
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:49,361
Well I can't help it.
I'm fucking addicted, okay?

326
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:52,031
So coffee and cigarettes.

327
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,534
That's your lunch? That
ain't healthy, is it?

328
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,037
You're drinking coffee
so don't break my fucking balls!

329
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:01,081
Νinny, I had lunch already.

330
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:04,543
So I'm on a diet, okay? Jesus!

331
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:10,966
Here comes my freaking kid.

332
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:22,061
Do me a favor,
don't tell your mother. Please.

333
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:26,398
What the fuck am I talking about... She
smokes like a fucking locomotive anyway.

334
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,776
How you doing Junior?

335
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,488
He don't talk much, does he?

336
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:36,116
Not lately. Lately he's
been the silent type.

337
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:40,579
I gave you 10 bucks last night,
so what'd you do with it?

338
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,590
I just gave you 5.

339
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,846
Listen, I'll give you 1 more. That's it.

340
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:03,394
Do I at least get a hug? For 6 bucks,
do get a freaking hug?

341
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,312
10 bucks for a hug?

342
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,231
You got to be out of your freaking mind!

343
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:09,191
Alright come here, I'll give ya'...

344
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,738
You better go get yourself something to eat
and something good.

345
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,909
Yeah, just like him.
Get some coffee and cigarettes!

346
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,453
Oh brother,
what the fuck are you talking about.

347
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,289
Look at how much fucking coffee
you're drinking!

348
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,499
You got the whole fucking pot
over there with you.

349
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:26,625
So what.

350
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:31,255
They always bring me a whole pot.
I like coffee. Keeps me going.

351
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:33,632
Keeps you going, right.
You're a fucking maniac.

352
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,217
A caffeine maniac.

353
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:36,719
You're drinking coffee aren't you?

354
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,345
- Yeah.
- So?

355
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:40,222
So maybe you should try to quit.

356
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:44,518
Hey, hey. I ain't no fucking quitter.

357
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,904
Fucking moron.

358
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:58,574
Aw shit, here comes my kid again.

359
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,330
How much did you spend?

360
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,875
And that's all you got for 4 bucks?

361
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:11,003
Peas and something to drink for 4 bucks!

362
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:14,673
- What the heck is in that bag?
- It's those Chinese peas.

363
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,468
They're not?

364
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:22,014
They're Japanese?
Chinese, Japanese. Same thing.

365
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,102
Try one.

366
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:41,033
Jesus Christ, tastes like black pepper!

367
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,201
Give me those...

368
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:46,288
Little bastard! Did you see that?

369
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:47,915
He tried to fucking poison me!

370
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:52,127
No he didn't Joe. Listen to me.
Those things are very expensive.

371
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,963
They're like a delicacy. A refined taste.

372
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:56,965
Refined taste, my ass...

373
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:02,971
Jesus Christ, not again.

374
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:07,810
Now I can't even light a fucking cigarette
around here without getting fucking busted!

375
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:10,729
You know something?
You really are a fucking moron.

376
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,899
I'm gonna get to those big tobacco
companies, and I'm going to thank them...

377
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,360
...when they put you in the fucking ground.

378
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:20,239
And did I ever tell that you're like a
fucking wife that I don't need.

379
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:25,744
Can't even enjoy a fucking cigarette.

380
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:42,946
Excuse me Miss. Umm...
Can I get you some more coffee?

381
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,573
Ahh,

382
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:47,826
I really wish you hadn't done that.

383
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:51,914
I had it the right color, the right
temperature. It was just right.

384
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:56,710
Sorry.

385
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,007
Uhh... Hi.

386
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:51,807
Sorry. Sorry about the coffee...

387
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,350
Sorry.

388
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:43,108
Does your name happen to be Gloria?

389
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,610
No.

390
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,654
Because I thought maybe you...

391
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:50,699
You're not friends with umm...

392
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,328
Sorry.

393
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:34,242
So, can I get you something else?
A sandwich, something to eat...

394
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:35,953
...along with your coffee?

395
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:40,165
It's not a very healthy lunch
just the coffee and cigarettes.

396
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,834
It's not my lunch, okay?

397
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,177
Sorry.

398
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:53,882
Alex...

399
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:56,301
You startled me.

400
00:34:58,387 --> 00:34:59,930
How are you, Isaach?

401
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:01,765
Okay?

402
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:06,770
Very well.

403
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:09,815
I'm happy to see you.

404
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:13,652
I was so sick of being in Paris.
You can't imagine.

405
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:17,155
Sit down.

406
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,998
So I was happy to get your call.

407
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,168
A long time we didn't see each other. No?

408
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:35,132
I ordered you some coffee. Okay?

409
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,967
Oh yeah, sure. Thanks.

410
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,428
So everything is okay?

411
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:41,972
Yeah.

412
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:46,101
Everything is okay. Very good.

413
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,270
I am fine.

414
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:37,444
So are you sure everything's okay with you?

415
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:38,737
Yes.

416
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,073
Everything is okay.

417
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,452
And you?

418
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,914
Me? Things are okay.

419
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:52,417
Not perfect you know,
but pretty much okay, yeah.

420
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:56,421
Good. I'm very happy to see you.

421
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,257
I'm happy to see you, man.

422
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,111
It's just that since I didn't see you
for so long...

423
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:22,155
...and you called to say
you wanted to see me.

424
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,282
I thought maybe something was wrong.

425
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:28,995
No. I just wanted to see you. That's all.

426
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:33,124
Me too, man. I wanted to see you too.

427
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:47,514
Are you sure there's nothing
you want to tell me.

428
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,474
Nothing bothering you?

429
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,809
But why,

430
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:54,646
do you want something to be wrong?

431
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,356
Hey, not at all.

432
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,149
But when I got your call,

433
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,819
but I had an intuition that
something was bothering you.

434
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:04,864
Something... maybe you need to talk about.
That's all, man.

435
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:09,869
Isaach. There is nothing wrong. Really.

436
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:13,707
Okay?

437
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:20,505
Are you sure?

438
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:23,842
Are you crazy, Isaach?

439
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:33,935
Are you sure you have nothing...

440
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:37,147
to, you know, to let out?

441
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:45,530
Should I invent something bad?
I could invent something bad for you.

442
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,949
Not at all. No. No...

443
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:52,078
I don't want you to invent something.
You know, I'm your best friend.

444
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:55,123
You should feel completely free
to tell me the truth.

445
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:58,543
To tell me whatever it is bothering you.

446
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:01,046
Cut the shit.

447
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:09,846
Okay. Okay. I understand. That's cool.

448
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,766
Thank you.

449
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,061
Hey, no problem.

450
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:19,189
Isaach, no problem.

451
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:45,882
Well, I guess I'm gonna go.

452
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:49,469
Really? So soon?

453
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:54,265
Yeah, you know man,
if you don't want to talk to me about it,

454
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,101
I don't want to be a problem.

455
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:03,274
There is no problem, Isaach.
Don't you understand? No problem.

456
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:06,778
I understand. But listen.

457
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:11,658
If you don't want to talk now...
Call me anytime, okay?

458
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:15,829
Now maybe it's not the right time
for you, that's all.

459
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:37,308
So, I was very happy to see you.

460
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:42,730
Yes. Me too.
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

461
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:45,775
But there is nothing wrong. Really.

462
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:48,820
It's okay, guy.

463
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:51,698
I understand.

464
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:55,076
No. You don't understand.

465
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:59,164
Call me, Alex.

466
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:00,874
See you, Isaach.

467
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:02,876
Soon.

468
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:23,122
- Hi... So nice to see you.
- Me too...

469
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,582
It's been ages.

470
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,918
Yeah. Yeah.

471
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:31,005
Last time was what?
A couple of years ago in Sydney, wasn't it?

472
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:33,091
Really, was that 2 years ago?

473
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:36,469
Wow. How are Jeff and Beryl?

474
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:38,680
Oh you know, same old, same old.

475
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:42,475
Still stuck in their odd
little parental ways.

476
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:47,605
So you're not with
Mr. Cate and the baby on this trip?

477
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:52,902
Ahh... No. No. Unfortunately
I'm by myself. I'll see them next week.

478
00:42:56,782 --> 00:43:00,118
- Everyone's good?
- Yeah. Yeah.

479
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:05,415
Yeah, I want a baby. At some point.

480
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:08,585
What can I get for you?

481
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:09,961
What you having Catie?

482
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:16,301
Oh umm... Can I have a espresso, please?
In a large cup.

483
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:20,597
Yeah, I'll have an espresso too,
thanks. A double.

484
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:23,433
And can I have some hot milk on the side?
And could you heat it?

485
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:25,893
- I think we can manage that.
- Thank you.

486
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:34,777
I'm sorry I'm late.
I know you haven't got a lot of time.

487
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:39,157
Oh. Don't worry about it.
I wish I could stay longer.

488
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:41,993
Do you stay here overnight?

489
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:45,830
Or do you just do
your press stuff here? Your junket.

490
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:49,500
Oh no. No, I stay overnight.

491
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,837
And I do the interviews here too.
It's easier...

492
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,506
I do my interviews in my suite,
in the room, upstairs.

493
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,842
And I just thought they're setting up
for the next interview

494
00:43:57,926 --> 00:44:02,764
and I just thought maybe
it would be nicer if we met down here.

495
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:08,102
No thanks Shell'. You're not...

496
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:13,650
Oh go on.
They're not going to stop you smoking!

497
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,866
- Here you go cous'.
- Thanks.

498
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:29,957
So you mean, they give you
this full-on hotel suite,

499
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:32,085
then they also use it for your publicity?

500
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:34,545
Yeah.

501
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:37,340
Seems kind of... cheap.

502
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:42,053
Well, I mean, it's a suite.
So they just divide up the room.

503
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,930
Yeah, but why couldn't they get you a suite

504
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:46,849
and get another suite to do your press in?

505
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:50,228
Well it's pretty low budget,
Shell', this thing I did.

506
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:52,355
Yeah, still.

507
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:55,024
Pretty cheap, man.

508
00:44:58,570 --> 00:44:59,737
Can I get you anything else?

509
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,865
- No thanks, that's great.
- You're welcome.

510
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:08,705
So umm...

511
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:12,083
Kinda weird getting in here.
I almost didn't.

512
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,878
Until they found out I was your cousin.

513
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:22,093
There's some photographer-Paparazzi
guys hanging out front.

514
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:25,513
I guess they kinda follow you around.

515
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:30,268
Oh you know, whatever so called
celebrities are around I suppose.

516
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:35,440
God that must be a real fucking drag
sometimes, right?

517
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:40,987
Not like me, I'm free!

518
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,656
Practically broke. But I'm completely free.

519
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:46,242
No one's stalking me,
that's for fucking sure.

520
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:52,999
Except when they thought I was you.
I got into this club once because...

521
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,293
...they thought I was you.

522
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:59,756
And then they found out I wasn't,
and asked me to leave.

523
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:01,549
Pretty fucking rude.

524
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:06,095
Don't get me wrong, it must be fabulous.

525
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:09,348
You got it all. You got a good husband,
beautiful baby.

526
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:12,643
Travel all over the world,
stay in fancy hotels.

527
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,229
Parties...

528
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:18,983
Yeah, well, you know what they say,
the grass is always greener.

529
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,778
So how's umm...

530
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:25,156
Shit ahh...

531
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,324
- Johnny.
- Who?

532
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:30,912
Jimmy... Tim... Tommy.
Sorry. How is he?

533
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:32,997
Oh Tommy...

534
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,584
We broke up almost 2 years ago.

535
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:40,588
Tommy, Yeah. What a dickhead.

536
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:44,967
Nah, got a new boyfriend now. Lee.
Remember?

537
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:48,179
He's in a band. Wrote you about him.

538
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:51,390
He's a pretty huge part of my life.

539
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:54,435
Sorry, Shell', but I don't think you did.

540
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:57,355
Yeah, I even sent you his fucking CD!

541
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:00,525
Your assistant probably
didn't give it to you.

542
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:06,531
It's okay, it's totally cool.
I know how busy your life is.

543
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,784
Do you remember where you sent it?

544
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:14,205
No. I mean, one week you're in L.A.

545
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:16,541
Then you're in London,
then you're in Sydney.

546
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:19,710
I mean you're in a different fucking city
every day of the week.

547
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:37,562
I'd love to hear the music.
What does it sound like?

548
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:40,731
Well it's really...

549
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,776
kinda hard...

550
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:46,904
...industrial, kind of throbbing...

551
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,076
I don't think you'd get it.

552
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,290
Well what are they called?

553
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:59,083
They're called, Sqürl.

554
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:00,668
Squirrel.

555
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:03,754
No. Sqürl. You know, like they say it here.

556
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:07,091
S-q-ü-r-l.
With an umlaut over the U. Sqürl.

557
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:12,096
Oh Sqürl. I get it. Right.

558
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:14,932
So I mean, can I buy the CD.
Until I find the one you sent?

559
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:16,767
No. Well not yet.

560
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:20,146
I mean, they recorded it
independently. You know, so...

561
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:23,274
But I think the record company's
going to put it out. Finally. Yeah.

562
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:24,817
I think.

563
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:32,783
Well I'm going to have to find that CD
so I can listen to it.

564
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:35,786
You're never going to find it.

565
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:39,582
Shell', that isn't fair. Actually...

566
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:41,792
Well it's true. You're
not going to find it.

567
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:42,960
Really.

568
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:49,675
Because I just remembered I didn't...

569
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:52,011
actually send it to you.

570
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:55,556
I think I just thought
about sending it to you.

571
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:12,657
Oh, hey. Almost forgot.

572
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,034
This is for you.

573
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:17,995
Thanks. What is it?

574
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:24,585
Oh wow, this is really expensive stuff!
Must've cost hundreds!

575
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:32,301
Yeah. Cool, thanks, yeah.
I could use this stuff.

576
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,888
Make me look like a movie star, right?

577
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,852
- Cheers.
- Cheers, gorgeous.

578
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:51,529
Seriously, Catie. Thanks for seeing me.

579
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:54,699
Oh no, thanks for seeing me.

580
00:49:55,534 --> 00:50:00,204
And thanks for all the fancy swag.

581
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:02,873
Oh, it's nothing.

582
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:07,336
It is swag, isn't it.

583
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:11,632
They probably give you
all kinds of free stuff.

584
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:16,721
Jewelry, clothes.
Probably give you cars, right?

585
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,598
No, they don't give me cars.

586
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:24,645
Yeah well they sometimes give me makeup
from time to time. But I just...

587
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:27,565
...thought, I don't know, I just wanted...

588
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:30,317
I didn't have time to go shopping.

589
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:33,612
No really it's fine, I mean,
it's great. I can use it.

590
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:39,660
It's just funny, don't you think?
That when you can't afford something...

591
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:42,079
...it's like really expensive.

592
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:45,291
And then when you can afford it...
...it's, like, free.

593
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,086
Kinda backward, don't you think?

594
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:54,592
Yeah well, the world's a bit like that
I guess, in a lot of ways.

595
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:58,804
Oh, speaking of paparazzi,

596
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:01,432
I saw these photos of you the other day
in the tabloids.

597
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,601
Oh don't tell me that. Yuck...

598
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:06,771
What was I wearing?

599
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:08,481
Oh, sorry...

600
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:13,861
Yeah? Hello? Hi Lindsey.

601
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:19,200
Yeah, I'm downstairs,
in the coffee room with my cousin, Shelly.

602
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:22,328
Already, really?

603
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:28,125
Okay, yeah. Yeah,
I'll be up in a minute. Okay. Bye.

604
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,668
- Got to get back to work?
- Yeah.

605
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:31,378
Back to the grind.

606
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:35,466
Do you want to come up to the room?

607
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:38,260
It won't be very interesting
but I mean, you're welcome to come up.

608
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:41,806
What, and watch you do
TV interviews and stuff?

609
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:43,891
Like Entertainment Tonight?

610
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:48,145
Yeah.

611
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:57,905
Yeah. Well maybe you can send me
that CD or a letter or something.

612
00:51:58,073 --> 00:51:59,573
Yeah, but you wouldn't read it.

613
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:02,576
Oh stop it. I would if
you actually sent it.

614
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:07,790
- I've really gotta go.
- Yeah.

615
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:09,375
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

616
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:11,085
- It was great seeing you.
- Yeah.

617
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:12,795
- Have you got my numbers?
- Yeah.

618
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:21,095
Oh take care.
Send my love to everyone.

619
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:26,559
Yeah, send my love to everyone on your end.

620
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:33,440
If they even remember me.

621
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,026
- Bye Catie.
- See ya Shell'.

622
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:39,780
Put that on my room,
and anything else she wants.

623
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:42,241
Hey maybe next time
I'll get to meet Lou.

624
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,617
Yeah...

625
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:45,870
It's Lee...

626
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:55,546
Ahh excuse me.

627
00:52:57,757 --> 00:53:00,551
Could I have a tequila, thanks.
A double. And the menu.

628
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:03,304
I'm sorry,
there's no smoking in the lounge.

629
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:57,918
So Jack, you going to tell me
about your Tesla Coil?

630
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:00,671
You said you didn't want to hear about it.

631
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:04,133
Yeah, I know, but that was awhile ago.

632
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:07,594
Well, I don't know
if I want to talk about it.

633
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:15,144
Come on Jack. You dragged it all the way
down here in your little red wagon.

634
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:17,479
Come on, just tell me about it.

635
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:26,530
Well I built it based on the inventor,
Nikola Tesla's original designs.

636
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,033
It's an air transformer...

637
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:33,037
...with primary and secondary coils
that are tuned to resonate.

638
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:36,540
It's basically a step-up transformer...

639
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:40,085
...which converts relatively low-voltage,
high current, to high-voltage,

640
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:43,005
low current at high frequencies.

641
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:47,301
Do you remember when we were kids

642
00:55:47,385 --> 00:55:50,429
you had a little Barbie makeup mirror?

643
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:52,431
Yeah I remember that.

644
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:55,392
Had a little fluorescent light on it.

645
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:59,271
Well Nikola Tesla invented
fluorescent light.

646
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:03,233
Without him, we wouldn't have
alternating current...

647
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:07,071
...radio, television, x-ray technology,

648
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:11,658
induction motors, particle beams, lasers.

649
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:13,991
None of that would even exist
if it weren't for him.

650
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:16,830
Or the rock band, Tesla.

651
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:21,418
Funny.

652
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:25,631
Tesla was a true genius.

653
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:28,464
If we would have paid more attention
to his ideas...

654
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:33,138
The world would be a much better place.
We'd have free mass communication.

655
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:36,183
Free transportation.
Free energy for everyone.

656
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:38,560
That's why they discredited him
in the end.

657
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:39,937
For free energy.

658
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:43,440
He perceived the Earth...

659
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:45,901
...as a conductor of acoustical resonance.

660
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,615
What a beautiful idea.

661
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:58,414
So Jack, are you going to show me
how the coil works?

662
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:02,000
Yeah, alright.

663
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:06,797
You'll need these.

664
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:37,953
- Alright, you ready Meg?
- I'm ready.

665
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:11,320
Damn it. Something went wrong.

666
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:13,906
It was cool though.

667
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,242
Yeah, but it wasn't supposed to stop.

668
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:19,953
It was supposed to keep working.
I don't know what happened.

669
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,873
Think maybe you blew a capacitor?

670
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:26,043
No I didn't blow a capacitor, Meg.

671
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:31,173
Maybe it tripped your GFI.

672
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:33,967
Yeah, your "ground fault interrupter."

673
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:37,763
Yeah I know what a GFI is.
That's not what happened.

674
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:40,390
You don't have to snap at me.

675
00:58:56,324 --> 00:59:00,661
I think maybe your spark gaps are too far
apart on your spark coil vibrator.

676
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:11,672
Ahh... Yeah that could be it.

677
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:14,883
I guess.

678
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:22,933
Yeah, that is it. That's it.
You're right about that.

679
00:59:23,142 --> 00:59:24,768
I didn't check that earlier.

680
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:40,075
Well I'm going to go home and check it out.

681
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:44,288
Are you going to go bowling, tomorrow?

682
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:45,372
Yeah I'll be there.

683
00:59:45,456 --> 00:59:47,124
Alright, I'll see you there.

684
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:38,342
Earth as a conductor of
acoustical resonance.

685
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:04,785
Hello? Hello who is this?
Laura, hi, hi...

686
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:07,537
This is Alfred Molina, for Steve Coogan.

687
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:09,873
Alfred Molina.

688
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:14,044
M-o-l-i-n-a.

689
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:17,798
The actor, yes.

690
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:22,219
Well I was just double checking
that Steve...

691
01:01:22,553 --> 01:01:24,388
...Oh he is. Great, great, great.

692
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:28,725
Well just in case you need it,
my cell-phone number is... Hello?

693
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:40,278
Hello, Alfred?

694
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:41,905
Steve hello.

695
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:45,992
Hi. Hi. I'm so glad you could make it.
Please sit down.

696
01:01:46,994 --> 01:01:49,205
I was just talking to
Laura, your assistant...

697
01:01:49,230 --> 01:01:51,063
seeing if you were
on your way here...

698
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:52,666
- I'm here.
- Fantastic.

699
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,876
I took the liberty of ordering some tea.

700
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:57,587
Shall I be mother?

701
01:01:58,256 --> 01:02:00,882
That's okay, I'll be my own mother.

702
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:02,801
Some milk there for you.

703
01:02:04,303 --> 01:02:06,096
- Real tea!
- Yeah...

704
01:02:07,306 --> 01:02:08,557
It's hard to come by.

705
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:10,225
I have this fantasy...

706
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:13,270
...if I ever won a Golden Globe or ahh...
an Academy Award,

707
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:16,940
I'd use the opportunity to tell the Yanks
how to make a decent cup of tea.

708
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:21,737
- Well here's to a good cup of tea.
- Cheers.

709
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:29,119
I love your ahh... I love your coat.

710
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:32,873
Yeah. Viv Westwood.

711
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:37,169
I just... I like...
I've got a weakness for British designers.

712
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:39,713
Yeah. I don't know
what it is about American designers.

713
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:42,591
They're just too... safe.

714
01:02:43,634 --> 01:02:46,386
Aren't you going to be a little bit warm?
It's about 85 outside.

715
01:02:48,681 --> 01:02:51,975
- Yeah. No, I take it off when I go out.
- Oh.

716
01:02:52,059 --> 01:02:54,394
- It's just the air-conditioning.
- Right.

717
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:03,612
So how long have you been living in L. A?

718
01:03:03,696 --> 01:03:05,989
Oh well, we've been here about 7 years.

719
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:07,955
- Wow.
- We love it here. We just love it here.

720
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:11,745
That's a long time. I do love visiting L.A.

721
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:15,916
But I always say, it's a great place to
visit, it's an even nicer place to leave.

722
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:22,923
The palm trees...
Palm trees annoy the fuck out of me.

723
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:25,801
Yeah, well it's not for everybody.

724
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:30,180
I like it here, but we came out here,
I came out here for the work and stuff.

725
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:35,936
It's great to...
It's great to finally meet you.

726
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:38,772
I got to say I'm a huge fan of your stuff.

727
01:03:38,856 --> 01:03:41,274
All the stuff you've done on Tv,
the comedy stuff...

728
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:43,902
I've got all... I've got all the tapes.

729
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:46,947
You know, I get them sent over.
It's fantastic.

730
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,281
Thank you.

731
01:03:51,702 --> 01:03:53,203
Yeah I'm ahh...

732
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:59,000
you know, likewise...
I'm certainly very aware of you.

733
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:00,085
Oh great.

734
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:05,715
I saw that Tv series you did.

735
01:04:05,758 --> 01:04:08,051
Oh yeah, you saw that?

736
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:09,886
- Yeah.
- Wow.

737
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:11,221
Interesting.

738
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:14,724
- Yeah, we got canceled.
- Yeah I heard that.

739
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:18,937
Comedy's such a difficult thing.

740
01:04:20,481 --> 01:04:21,481
Yeah.

741
01:04:24,777 --> 01:04:26,570
Well your career seems to be
going terribly well.

742
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:29,573
I mean, you've got a lot of heat
at the moment.

743
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:31,324
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

744
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:34,045
- Is that why you're here?
- Well you know...

745
01:04:34,078 --> 01:04:36,413
The merry-go-round of meetings.

746
01:04:36,497 --> 01:04:40,375
It's nice, people are "finally"...

747
01:04:40,793 --> 01:04:43,086
...starting to take a bit of notice.
Which is great.

748
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:46,089
- Are you meeting on anything interesting?
- Yeah...

749
01:04:54,932 --> 01:04:57,434
I've got to say you were just...

750
01:04:58,144 --> 01:05:01,104
fantastic in 24 Hour...

751
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:05,650
No, seriously, 24 Hour Party People
was just a knock-out. I mean, brilliant.

752
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:07,694
- Great work.
- Thank you.

753
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:10,113
- Really brilliant.
- I was...

754
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:13,408
And the reviews.

755
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,453
They were pretty fuckin' great.

756
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:19,080
I was amazed... because you know it was...

757
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:22,876
I didn't think many people would get
all the sort of, cultural references.

758
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:26,129
Sort of, Manchester, early 80's,
the whole kind of music scene...

759
01:05:26,213 --> 01:05:27,213
You'd be surprised.

760
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:30,467
Yeah, but a lot of people really didn't
have any kind of reference to make to it.

761
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:34,346
Because of the...
They know about the bands over here.

762
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:38,642
But the whole thing, your character,
and his running the TV show...

763
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:40,060
Do you want a cigarette?

764
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:43,605
- Sorry, they're French.
- Oh, that's okay. Thanks.

765
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:51,988
No. I'll save it for later.

766
01:05:53,532 --> 01:05:54,991
Oh, okay.

767
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:07,253
Umm so, Laura said...

768
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:12,509
...she said, that you were really keen to
meeting. Something she didn't tell me.

769
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:14,594
She wouldn't tell me what it was.

770
01:06:14,845 --> 01:06:18,181
Well I didn't want to say it over the
phone, because it would've sounded weird.

771
01:06:18,265 --> 01:06:21,184
I can imagine how she thought,
this was coming out of nowhere.

772
01:06:21,268 --> 01:06:26,564
I phone her up, doesn't know me from Adam.
I must talk to Steve Coogan.

773
01:06:26,857 --> 01:06:28,525
But I wanted to see you in person.

774
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:30,568
When I found out you were going to
be here for a couple of days...

775
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:33,697
...I thought this was the
perfect opportunity...

776
01:06:33,864 --> 01:06:39,536
Anyway... I'll get right to it.
I'm so excited about this.

777
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:42,580
Let me try and put it in context. I'm...

778
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:47,669
I've always had a big passion for history.

779
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:50,046
You know... and people's lives...

780
01:06:50,214 --> 01:06:55,301
...and all the little events of
how you get from A to B.

781
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:59,556
And all the small details in people's
lives, are kind of really...

782
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:02,350
...full of epic qualities. You know?

783
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:05,145
So I've been doing all this research.

784
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:09,983
Anyway, I... I've come up with this.

785
01:07:10,317 --> 01:07:15,655
And what state is... is it greenlit or is
it just a treatment? What stage is it in?

786
01:07:16,824 --> 01:07:20,994
I'm sorry no. God, how embarrassing...
It's not some...

787
01:07:21,078 --> 01:07:25,331
This isn't work, has nothing to do with
work. It's not you know, a project.

788
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:28,293
What this is,
is I did some genealogical research...

789
01:07:28,419 --> 01:07:31,087
...and what I came across...
What I discovered was...

790
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:32,338
Mister Coogan?

791
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:33,131
Yes?

792
01:07:33,257 --> 01:07:34,758
- It is you, isn't it?
- It is, yes.

793
01:07:34,842 --> 01:07:37,093
Oh umm... I'm such a huge fan.

794
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:40,597
You're not that huge. Only where it counts.

795
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:44,517
Could I bother you for an autograph.

796
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:46,102
- Absolutely.
- Great.

797
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:50,106
I've been recognized.
Where do you want it?

798
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:52,776
Oh, umm paper is fine.

799
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:54,152
Spoil-sport.

800
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:57,363
- Oh no, no. Don't do that.
- Sorry.

801
01:07:57,615 --> 01:08:00,617
- I probably have something in my bag.
- Okay.

802
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:02,702
Give me a second here.

803
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:06,790
Oh gosh. So sorry.

804
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:07,916
It's alright.

805
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:12,170
- Give me one more minute.
- Take your time.

806
01:08:12,296 --> 01:08:14,631
Here, please, in there.

807
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:17,467
- Okay, and what's your name?
- Katy.

808
01:08:17,551 --> 01:08:19,636
- Katy.
- With a Y.

809
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:22,347
Alright. What Katy did next.

810
01:08:23,682 --> 01:08:26,810
- Hello.
- Alfred's an actor too.

811
01:08:29,313 --> 01:08:31,731
- Here.
- Oh. Thank you. Great.

812
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,693
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome. Never mind.

813
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:44,828
- Wow...
- Well, let's get back to this.

814
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:46,663
I don't want to take up
too much of your time.

815
01:08:46,747 --> 01:08:47,622
- I know you're busy...
- Sure. Yeah.

816
01:08:47,706 --> 01:08:51,000
As I said, I did this
genealogical research.

817
01:08:51,085 --> 01:08:52,765
I was just doing it for my own interest...

818
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:56,631
I wasn't looking for anything specific.
I just came across this.

819
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:02,512
I'll cut a long story short.
Steve Coogan...

820
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:06,099
Drum roll. Umm,

821
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:08,852
well the thing is Steve.

822
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:13,189
You and I are cousins.

823
01:09:16,735 --> 01:09:19,904
How do you mean?
What... Do you mean artistically?

824
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:22,407
No. No. No!
I mean in the normal way.

825
01:09:22,533 --> 01:09:25,326
We're cousins. We're related.

826
01:09:26,203 --> 01:09:27,203
Whoa.

827
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:31,416
- It's amazing isn't?
- Yeah. I mean... Are you sure?

828
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:33,710
See the way it works out is, look...

829
01:09:34,211 --> 01:09:39,549
My great-great grandfather is
your great-great uncle.

830
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:45,096
And further back, we shared the same
great-great-great grandfather.

831
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:50,560
Wow, yeah... my ancestry is Irish
but I knew there was an Italian...

832
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:52,562
Well that's it! The Italian connection is

833
01:09:52,646 --> 01:09:55,315
our great-great-great great grandfather,
Giuseppe.

834
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:57,525
- Wow.
- Isn't that amazing?

835
01:09:57,610 --> 01:10:01,154
This is a lot of detail.

836
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,698
Yeah, well it's my thing.
I kinda do a little...

837
01:10:03,782 --> 01:10:04,616
Amazing.

838
01:10:04,742 --> 01:10:09,078
I think it's just great to say that
I'm related to Steve Coogan.

839
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:12,999
Likewise, I can tell people
I'm related to Albert Molina.

840
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:14,250
Alfred.

841
01:10:14,418 --> 01:10:15,418
Yeah...

842
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:20,965
No it's my Grandmother...
...who's the big one on the family tree.

843
01:10:21,175 --> 01:10:24,427
She'll be very thrilled.
She's a huge fan of your work.

844
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:26,512
She loved you in...

845
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:30,391
Boogie Nights.

846
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:32,977
Oh right! With the shorts and
the shotgun? Yeah.

847
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:35,396
Yeah, she talked about that once.

848
01:10:36,315 --> 01:10:40,068
Great. Great. But you know... I know
this is coming right out of the blue.

849
01:10:40,152 --> 01:10:41,945
But just think of the possibilities.

850
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:44,197
It's fantastic, listen,
let's look at the facts.

851
01:10:44,281 --> 01:10:48,785
We're both actors. We're cousins,
we've established that.

852
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:51,496
We could... We could maybe work together.

853
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:55,291
Do a play maybe.
We could make a... a movie.

854
01:10:55,459 --> 01:10:57,961
We could actually do a movie
about this story.

855
01:10:58,128 --> 01:11:01,089
About discovering this amazing thing
between us. That we're cousins.

856
01:11:01,173 --> 01:11:05,301
The story could be two actors,
who discover that they're cousins.

857
01:11:05,427 --> 01:11:07,053
We could actually play ourselves.

858
01:11:07,805 --> 01:11:12,684
We'd be in the movie, I'd be Fred Molina,
you'd be Steve Coo... We'd be cousins.

859
01:11:12,893 --> 01:11:15,979
In the movie. It's fantastic!

860
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:18,648
It'd be great. Absolutely great!

861
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:24,779
You know... or not. I mean, you know,
we could just hang out.

862
01:11:24,863 --> 01:11:27,824
Yeah, no, we should definitely go
for a beer sometime. That'd great.

863
01:11:27,992 --> 01:11:30,702
Maybe go on vacation together, you know.

864
01:11:30,828 --> 01:11:34,038
Just the two of us,
sort of, get to know each other.

865
01:11:41,171 --> 01:11:42,505
You're not gay are you?

866
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:47,051
No. No. No, no. I'm... I'm married.

867
01:11:47,177 --> 01:11:49,345
Yeah, well, so was James the First.

868
01:11:50,514 --> 01:11:53,182
Sorry. I don't know,
that popped into my head.

869
01:11:53,434 --> 01:11:54,851
Say it, get it out of the way.
Know what I mean?

870
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:58,604
I understand.
I know exactly what you're thinking.

871
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:00,731
If somebody came up to me going,
I'm your cousin...

872
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:04,694
I'd think they were a nutter as well.
Take it from me, I'm not crazy.

873
01:12:04,862 --> 01:12:09,324
I just think this is a
fantastic, extraordinary,

874
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:11,576
delightful thing for me.

875
01:12:11,702 --> 01:12:12,368
Absolutely.

876
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:14,871
- And I just wanted you to know about it.
- Ditto.

877
01:12:15,622 --> 01:12:19,042
All I want, if I want anything is
for you to just,

878
01:12:19,376 --> 01:12:23,629
acknowledge this extraordinary thing.
And...

879
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:27,550
and just love me.

880
01:12:35,809 --> 01:12:38,061
Yeah. I could do that.

881
01:12:49,823 --> 01:12:53,409
I have to... go.

882
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:55,745
I didn't tell you...

883
01:12:55,871 --> 01:12:59,207
...I have this meeting.
It actually moved forward.

884
01:12:59,291 --> 01:12:59,874
I see.

885
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:04,420
It's at Universal.
Number crunchers, financiers.

886
01:13:05,589 --> 01:13:06,714
So umm...

887
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:12,678
This... This... Is this ahh...

888
01:13:12,763 --> 01:13:14,389
- That's for you.
- Okay.

889
01:13:14,473 --> 01:13:15,473
It's yours.

890
01:13:16,642 --> 01:13:20,978
I'll make sure that gets filed.

891
01:13:21,105 --> 01:13:22,897
Sure. Sure.

892
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:24,607
Well you're going to be here
for a couple of days, right?

893
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:26,234
So maybe we could see each other
before you go.

894
01:13:26,318 --> 01:13:30,154
Yeah, ahh... Okay,
ummm... checking the mental diary...

895
01:13:34,618 --> 01:13:37,870
This is not... This is not good.

896
01:13:37,955 --> 01:13:42,291
The time I'm here. It's just backed up.

897
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:43,126
- I understand.
- I'm backed up.

898
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:44,085
Listen, no problem.

899
01:13:44,169 --> 01:13:48,131
Give me your cell-phone number and
I'll call you before you go.

900
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:50,383
There's a story there... The... The...

901
01:13:50,467 --> 01:13:53,136
The... There's a tri-band system here
in the states.

902
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:55,430
Which is different to...

903
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:58,266
...the system in the UK.
And it's a kind of... We...

904
01:13:58,684 --> 01:14:04,105
The cell-phones... they don't work here.
So I'm kind of cell-phone less, in the U.S.

905
01:14:04,189 --> 01:14:08,568
Oh I see. Well...
give me your home number, I'll call you.

906
01:14:08,902 --> 01:14:11,112
- You've got my PA's number, right?
- Yeah.

907
01:14:11,196 --> 01:14:12,905
Great, then we're connected.

908
01:14:13,532 --> 01:14:16,159
Well, can't... can't you give me
your number at home?

909
01:14:19,079 --> 01:14:24,542
Can I say no?
Because nothing, absolutely no...

910
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,752
...nothing personal. It's just I don't...

911
01:14:26,837 --> 01:14:30,673
I never give my number out. Ever.

912
01:14:30,799 --> 01:14:34,051
It's just a space... personal space thing.
I never... It's just a rule...

913
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:35,970
...and I always think, stick to the rule,
stick to the rule...

914
01:14:36,054 --> 01:14:40,683
You know, stick to the rule. And... it's
more of a philosophy than a rule, really.

915
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:46,355
I can say...
I've not given my number out to many...

916
01:14:46,773 --> 01:14:47,973
...eminent people in the past.

917
01:14:48,025 --> 01:14:52,278
I once didn't give my number to Sam Mendes.
So you're in good company.

918
01:14:54,907 --> 01:14:58,201
Well if it's good enough for Sam Mendes,
it's good enough for me.

919
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:00,161
Yeah.

920
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:07,043
- I think it's me.
- Oh that's right. Mine doesn't work.

921
01:15:07,127 --> 01:15:08,961
I'm sorry, I got to take this...

922
01:15:11,048 --> 01:15:12,048
Hello?

923
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:14,842
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

924
01:15:16,929 --> 01:15:20,556
Spike, hi... How you doing?

925
01:15:20,724 --> 01:15:22,141
Yeah, you got the message.

926
01:15:22,226 --> 01:15:26,395
My agent just called you, just to
make sure we're all on the same page.

927
01:15:27,648 --> 01:15:30,900
No the producer credit is just so
you and I...

928
01:15:31,235 --> 01:15:32,735
Can sort of keep tabs on everything,

929
01:15:32,861 --> 01:15:34,779
you know, artistic integrity,
all that sort of thing.

930
01:15:34,905 --> 01:15:36,705
Otherwise the whole thing
could just run away.

931
01:15:40,911 --> 01:15:44,580
Oh you bastard, no... Alright.

932
01:15:45,249 --> 01:15:47,667
Yeah, you still okay for Sunday?
Good, alright.

933
01:15:47,876 --> 01:15:49,919
Will I meet you there? Alright.

934
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:53,381
Nice and early. Okay yeah, yeah.
Lots of love.

935
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:54,757
Bye, bye Spike.

936
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:58,761
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's okay, okay... Fine. Fine.

937
01:15:59,304 --> 01:16:01,472
So... Umm... You... Was...

938
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:04,183
Was that Spike Lee?

939
01:16:04,268 --> 01:16:07,186
Oh no, no, no.
I don't even know Spike Lee.

940
01:16:07,271 --> 01:16:08,604
No, that was Spike Jonze.

941
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:10,147
- Spike Jonze!
- Yeah.

942
01:16:10,274 --> 01:16:13,401
- I love him!
- Yeah, he's a good man. Good man, Spike.

943
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:16,779
Yeah, we've been... We've been
friends for a long, long time now.

944
01:16:17,155 --> 01:16:21,075
We're both keen hikers, We've...
Well, it's very boring.

945
01:16:21,159 --> 01:16:22,618
No, no, no, go on.

946
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:27,456
Well we belong to a club.
And we go hiking on weekends.

947
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:31,919
He's a very, very, very committed
environmentalist.

948
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:33,838
Spike Jonze is a tree-hugger...

949
01:16:33,964 --> 01:16:36,132
Jesus, I never had him down as that.

950
01:16:39,469 --> 01:16:43,389
Well, I think he prefers the term,
leaf-people.

951
01:16:43,974 --> 01:16:45,600
As do I.

952
01:16:48,895 --> 01:16:51,939
Right, yeah, no... I mean, that's...
Don't get me wrong...

953
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:56,485
...I think it's great, I love trees.
I think there should be...

954
01:16:57,195 --> 01:17:01,824
there should be more of them.
When I use paper, I use both sides.

955
01:17:02,576 --> 01:17:05,411
Umm... I would love to...

956
01:17:10,834 --> 01:17:15,212
You know, I'm going to tear up
that stupid rule about

957
01:17:15,339 --> 01:17:19,675
phone numbers and... It's such shit.

958
01:17:21,845 --> 01:17:24,764
Would it be shabby of me
to give you my number now?

959
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:29,310
Yeah.

960
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:32,647
Okay.

961
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:36,651
Okay. Okay.

962
01:17:39,363 --> 01:17:42,406
I've... I've got to go. I'm so sorry.

963
01:17:44,701 --> 01:17:47,370
- I'll get the check.
- Good.

964
01:18:00,717 --> 01:18:01,717
Fuck...

965
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:42,299
Damn RZA, where the fuck you at?

966
01:18:54,938 --> 01:18:57,940
- Yo, yo, yo. Peace, yo.
- Bobby...

967
01:18:58,066 --> 01:19:00,151
- Word, man. Word, word.
- Chill.

968
01:19:01,278 --> 01:19:02,611
Pardon me for being late, Fam'.

969
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:04,405
Ain't nothing man, I was about
to hit you on the horn.

970
01:19:04,489 --> 01:19:06,782
Yeah, I had a fucking
emergency house call, yo.

971
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:09,952
- House call?
- Yeah, house call.

972
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:13,539
Sophia and Sifu's children got sick with
the flu and the virus.

973
01:19:13,623 --> 01:19:17,209
So I went by,
scored some herbal medicines for them.

974
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:21,005
I told them, lay off the dairy products.
Chill on the citric acid...

975
01:19:21,131 --> 01:19:22,631
...and they should feel a little better,
you know?

976
01:19:22,716 --> 01:19:25,801
Umm so, you a doctor now, or something?

977
01:19:26,136 --> 01:19:27,428
Yeah, yo. I told you, yo!

978
01:19:27,512 --> 01:19:30,598
I've been studying alternative medicine
for two years now, son.

979
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:33,642
I mean, ancient healing techniques,
and all that, yo.

980
01:19:33,935 --> 01:19:37,146
Check this, yo. I even know
a certain surgical procedure

981
01:19:37,230 --> 01:19:39,190
that I can perform using a drill-gun.

982
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:42,943
Electric drill-gun. I'm dead serious, yo.

983
01:19:43,195 --> 01:19:46,739
But, yo, my hands are nice from being a DJ,
you know what I mean?

984
01:19:46,823 --> 01:19:49,617
To me music and medicine all go together.

985
01:19:49,701 --> 01:19:53,496
It's like two planets revolving
around the same sun. So... bong-bong!

986
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:55,247
- Want some tea?
- Yeah, splash me,

987
01:19:55,332 --> 01:19:56,999
It's all herbals man. No caffeine.

988
01:19:57,125 --> 01:20:01,378
That's what I'm talkin' about, no caffeine.
Caffeine is ridiculous right now, man.

989
01:20:01,713 --> 01:20:03,047
Tell me about it.

990
01:20:03,465 --> 01:20:06,342
That's what I'm saying, caffeine.
Caffeine leads to depression.

991
01:20:06,676 --> 01:20:08,260
Makes you all irritable.

992
01:20:08,428 --> 01:20:11,722
Have your heart beatin' fast,
faster heart rate, you know what I mean?

993
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:15,267
And worse than anything, you drink
that coffee it gives you the shits.

994
01:20:15,352 --> 01:20:18,604
You know what I mean?
So I try to say away from that.

995
01:20:18,855 --> 01:20:20,397
I'm off that shit anyway.

996
01:20:20,732 --> 01:20:22,858
- Crisp and clean, no caffeine.
- Yeah.

997
01:20:23,026 --> 01:20:26,529
- To liquid swords, family.
- Naw, to Bobby Digital.

998
01:20:26,988 --> 01:20:29,114
- Wu-Tang forever.
- Wu-Tang forever.

999
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:33,035
Does anybody need more coffee?

1000
01:20:33,328 --> 01:20:35,871
- Kitchen's closing.
- Naw man, we don't mess with caffeine.

1001
01:20:35,956 --> 01:20:37,998
- You don't?
- Naw, I don't.

1002
01:20:38,291 --> 01:20:40,751
Don't you know caffeine can
cause serious delirium?

1003
01:20:40,877 --> 01:20:43,045
- Delirium?
- Serious delirium.

1004
01:20:43,171 --> 01:20:47,800
Oh now you tell me.
Well that may be my problem. Delirium.

1005
01:20:52,722 --> 01:20:56,475
Aren't you Bill Murray, man?
That's... You Bill Murray?

1006
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:00,688
Yeah, I'm Bill Murray. But ahh,
let's keep that just between us, alright?

1007
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:04,692
Just between us.

1008
01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:10,155
And you guys are, ahh... related.

1009
01:21:10,574 --> 01:21:12,408
Yeah, we're Cousins. We're Family.

1010
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:16,245
No, you're messing with me,
'cause you're both trouble makers.

1011
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:19,415
- Trouble makers!
- The Wu-Tang clan.

1012
01:21:19,583 --> 01:21:20,916
Right, Wu-Tang Clan.

1013
01:21:22,043 --> 01:21:24,086
- You're GZA, the genius.
- That's right.

1014
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:26,630
- And you're RZA...
- A.K. A...

1015
01:21:28,925 --> 01:21:29,675
Bobby Digital.

1016
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:32,303
Yeah, he knows hip-hop, yo,
he knows hip-hop.

1017
01:21:32,429 --> 01:21:34,430
And you're Bill Murray.

1018
01:21:34,598 --> 01:21:38,934
Bill Groundhog Day,
Ghostbustin' ass Murray.

1019
01:21:39,102 --> 01:21:42,021
- Who ya' gonna call!
- I know that. Just don't tell anybody, alright.

1020
01:21:42,105 --> 01:21:44,523
What you mean, don't tell anybody,
Bill Murray? I mean...

1021
01:21:44,608 --> 01:21:45,983
people are going to come in here,
they're gonna see you.

1022
01:21:46,109 --> 01:21:47,860
You're Bill Murray. It's obvious.

1023
01:21:48,111 --> 01:21:50,362
Unless you're wearing
a disguise or something.

1024
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:54,116
Well, I am wearing kind of a disguise.

1025
01:21:56,036 --> 01:21:57,912
Damn that's harsh, money.

1026
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:00,915
You're a real caffeine junkie, aren't you.

1027
01:22:00,999 --> 01:22:03,125
Just keep it down, just between us.
Here, cheers.

1028
01:22:11,635 --> 01:22:13,510
You know, before I gave that up...

1029
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:15,596
...I used to drink it every night,

1030
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:18,849
every single night up
until it was time to go to sleep.

1031
01:22:19,059 --> 01:22:20,976
It was to make me dream faster.

1032
01:22:21,061 --> 01:22:24,772
You know, like when they flash
those cameras on those Indy 500 cars?

1033
01:22:25,023 --> 01:22:26,023
And they just...

1034
01:22:30,153 --> 01:22:32,529
That's how my dreams were.
Just whizzin' by.

1035
01:22:32,906 --> 01:22:35,491
- You're stupid, yo.
- He is stupid, isn't he?

1036
01:22:41,665 --> 01:22:45,584
I know a guy who freezes coffee.
Puts sticks in it...

1037
01:22:46,044 --> 01:22:47,670
Has himself a coffee popsicle.

1038
01:22:47,754 --> 01:22:49,713
- A caf' pop.
- A caf' pop.

1039
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:55,928
Damn...

1040
01:22:56,346 --> 01:22:57,972
That don't sound too good, Bill Murray!

1041
01:22:58,056 --> 01:23:01,558
It's not the flu or anything...
It's just smokers cough.

1042
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:05,521
That's what I'm trying to tell you...
The nicotine, man.

1043
01:23:05,605 --> 01:23:08,023
Nicotine interferes with
the central nervous system.

1044
01:23:08,149 --> 01:23:09,942
Your respiratorial system,

1045
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:13,529
I mean, in very small doses
it causes paralysis.

1046
01:23:17,951 --> 01:23:20,327
- Really?
- Yeah, really man.

1047
01:23:20,412 --> 01:23:23,080
I mean, just 50 milligrams alone...

1048
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:25,791
...have been proven to be fatal
in a few minutes, man.

1049
01:23:26,042 --> 01:23:28,961
- How much is in one cigarette?
- 3 milligrams.

1050
01:23:29,212 --> 01:23:33,215
And did you know they also use nicotine
for an insecticide? To kill bugs.

1051
01:23:33,383 --> 01:23:35,426
It's good that it kills bugs, right?

1052
01:23:36,970 --> 01:23:38,554
Are you a bug, Bill Murray?

1053
01:23:41,141 --> 01:23:44,476
- Jesus, RZA, you sound like my doctor.
- He is a doctor...

1054
01:23:44,602 --> 01:23:48,105
Actually he specializes in
...alternative medicine.

1055
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:51,525
That is, alternative to this planet.

1056
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:59,241
Well... do me a favor and
don't tell anybody you saw me here.

1057
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:03,579
- You can trust us Bill Murray.
- So Bill Murray.

1058
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:06,874
You hiding out or something?

1059
01:24:07,417 --> 01:24:10,419
Yeah, sort of. Something like that.

1060
01:24:11,129 --> 01:24:13,172
Now I'm thinking it may be delirium.

1061
01:24:13,298 --> 01:24:15,174
- Serious delirium.
- Serious.

1062
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:17,676
Well if you're on the low,

1063
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:20,429
I got something
that'll help you with your disguise.

1064
01:24:21,014 --> 01:24:22,139
Take this.

1065
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,040
- Use whatever you want.
- Oh geez...

1066
01:24:25,101 --> 01:24:26,769
Rock that, man. Stay on the low.

1067
01:24:26,853 --> 01:24:29,021
This is nice stuff.
You didn't have to do this. This is great.

1068
01:24:29,147 --> 01:24:30,731
A bag if items for you, Bill.

1069
01:24:30,815 --> 01:24:32,649
- Thank you.
- Don't worry about it.

1070
01:24:32,776 --> 01:24:34,318
I really appreciate this.

1071
01:24:36,446 --> 01:24:37,446
This is great.

1072
01:24:40,033 --> 01:24:41,867
Doc, what could I do for this cough?

1073
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:44,620
Damn I was just thinking about that.
Check this out.

1074
01:24:44,788 --> 01:24:48,832
- You get some hydrogen peroxide.
- We got that. For cuts and stuff.

1075
01:24:48,958 --> 01:24:52,044
Take fifty percent hydrogen peroxide,
fifty percent water.

1076
01:24:52,170 --> 01:24:55,130
You gargle with it.
Do not swallow, spit it out.

1077
01:24:55,215 --> 01:24:56,673
Don't swallow, Bill Murray.

1078
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:59,885
And if that doesn't work...
Try oven cleaner.

1079
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:02,596
I got that in the back too.

1080
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:05,224
- Thank you.
- Cool.

1081
01:25:05,308 --> 01:25:06,975
Thank you. I'm going to try it right now.

1082
01:25:10,730 --> 01:25:11,730
- Word.
- Word.

1083
01:25:11,815 --> 01:25:13,899
- Word man.
- Bill mother-fuckin' Murray!

1084
01:25:14,025 --> 01:25:15,317
It's crazy yo.

1085
01:25:16,736 --> 01:25:19,822
- Yo. Yo. Yo. Yo, Three o'clock.
- What's up?

1086
01:25:19,906 --> 01:25:22,574
I told Ghost to be here by 3 am.

1087
01:25:22,784 --> 01:25:25,953
Don't hold your breath on that one, man.
You know how it is waitin' on Ghost.

1088
01:25:26,162 --> 01:25:26,912
We'll be here all night.

1089
01:25:26,996 --> 01:25:28,413
Think we can smoke a
blunt up in this joint?

1090
01:25:28,498 --> 01:25:31,166
Nah, it's hot up in here with the 5-0.

1091
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:33,001
But we always smoke weed in here though.

1092
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:35,546
That was until Dirt Dog done blew it up.

1093
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:38,841
I told Deflon, never let Dirty
inside this spot, man.

1094
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:40,759
So what's up, what you want to do, yo?

1095
01:25:41,010 --> 01:25:44,012
- Yo, let's slide to the 'udio.
- Hit the 'udio, right. Play some chess?

1096
01:25:44,139 --> 01:25:45,389
- Yeah.
- Alright then.

1097
01:25:45,515 --> 01:25:47,724
Is that the bill... for Murray?

1098
01:25:48,017 --> 01:25:50,644
- He don't need no money, yo.
- Hit him anyway.

1099
01:25:50,895 --> 01:25:52,146
Think I should tip him?

1100
01:25:56,192 --> 01:25:58,110
You think he's using the oven cleaner?

1101
01:25:58,194 --> 01:26:00,114
I don't know, but let's get
the fuck out of here.

1102
01:26:26,055 --> 01:26:27,681
Are you alright, Taylor?

1103
01:26:30,852 --> 01:26:32,436
No, not really.

1104
01:26:33,146 --> 01:26:34,229
What's up?

1105
01:26:36,065 --> 01:26:40,235
I don't know.
I feel so divorced from the world.

1106
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:42,988
I've lost touch with the world.

1107
01:26:44,574 --> 01:26:47,659
Do you know that song by Mahler?

1108
01:26:48,953 --> 01:26:51,330
"I've Lost Track Of The World"?

1109
01:26:51,748 --> 01:26:52,748
No.

1110
01:26:54,083 --> 01:26:55,626
It's one of the most...

1111
01:26:56,544 --> 01:26:59,963
beautiful saddest songs ever written.

1112
01:27:02,592 --> 01:27:06,261
I can almost hear it now.

1113
01:27:11,601 --> 01:27:12,851
Can you hear it?

1114
01:28:03,736 --> 01:28:04,945
Oh...

1115
01:28:05,655 --> 01:28:09,157
It's gone now. But did you hear it?

1116
01:28:09,867 --> 01:28:10,993
I think so.

1117
01:28:14,664 --> 01:28:18,083
It resonated right through
the whole building.

1118
01:28:19,669 --> 01:28:21,253
Where are we?

1119
01:28:21,671 --> 01:28:27,217
In the Armory, Taylor.

1120
01:28:29,178 --> 01:28:32,848
It sounds so heavy and ponderous.

1121
01:28:34,309 --> 01:28:36,393
The Armory.

1122
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:40,647
Nikola Tesla.

1123
01:28:41,816 --> 01:28:45,485
Perceived the Earth as a conductor...

1124
01:28:45,987 --> 01:28:49,531
...of acoustical resonance.

1125
01:28:52,869 --> 01:28:55,704
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1126
01:28:58,041 --> 01:28:59,791
Can you explain it to me?

1127
01:29:00,293 --> 01:29:01,501
No, not really.

1128
01:29:01,586 --> 01:29:06,548
I know. Let's pretend
this coffee is champagne.

1129
01:29:08,468 --> 01:29:09,885
Why would we do that?

1130
01:29:10,928 --> 01:29:13,180
Well, to celebrate life.

1131
01:29:14,682 --> 01:29:18,060
You know, like the rich, elegant people do.

1132
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:21,063
The classy people.

1133
01:29:22,106 --> 01:29:26,735
I prefer coffee,
simple working man's coffee.

1134
01:29:26,903 --> 01:29:31,281
Oh, you're so provincial, Bill.

1135
01:29:31,574 --> 01:29:33,575
Do you know what your problem is?

1136
01:29:34,744 --> 01:29:35,744
What?

1137
01:29:37,622 --> 01:29:41,708
You have no joie de vivre.

1138
01:29:43,669 --> 01:29:44,669
I don't?

1139
01:29:46,589 --> 01:29:50,425
No, besides, this coffee is awful.

1140
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:54,721
You're right, it really is bad isn't it?

1141
01:29:55,098 --> 01:29:56,765
Dreadful.

1142
01:29:57,725 --> 01:29:59,643
I propose a toast.

1143
01:30:01,062 --> 01:30:02,896
So, what should we toast.

1144
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:07,401
Oh God... Paris.

1145
01:30:07,610 --> 01:30:11,029
In the 1920's. Josephine Baker...

1146
01:30:11,114 --> 01:30:12,906
The Moulin Rouge...

1147
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:16,451
Qu'est-ce Que c'est...
ca Va... pa-pa...

1148
01:30:17,328 --> 01:30:22,040
And also, New York. In the 70's.

1149
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:24,209
In the late 70's.

1150
01:30:25,002 --> 01:30:27,129
Really? Alright.

1151
01:30:27,630 --> 01:30:29,589
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1152
01:30:35,054 --> 01:30:36,972
Delicious, isn't it?

1153
01:30:38,349 --> 01:30:42,436
Ahh, champagne. Nectar of the Gods.

1154
01:30:44,188 --> 01:30:47,315
Is that all you're having for lunch,
is a coffee and a cigarette?

1155
01:30:47,442 --> 01:30:49,151
It's not very healthy.

1156
01:30:50,862 --> 01:30:52,529
We had lunch earlier.

1157
01:30:56,117 --> 01:30:57,325
We did?

1158
01:30:59,036 --> 01:31:03,248
We're on, like a break here.
A coffee break here.

1159
01:31:04,750 --> 01:31:06,793
Oh, how depressing.

1160
01:31:07,962 --> 01:31:09,838
How long is our break, anyway?

1161
01:31:10,131 --> 01:31:13,675
About 10 minutes,
and it's nearly over now.

1162
01:31:17,555 --> 01:31:19,389
Say it isn't true.

1163
01:31:22,185 --> 01:31:24,519
- Well...
- What?

1164
01:31:25,062 --> 01:31:28,523
I asked you to say it isn't true.

1165
01:31:28,733 --> 01:31:30,358
Say what isn't true?

1166
01:31:31,861 --> 01:31:34,696
Oh, never, never, never mind.

1167
01:31:35,948 --> 01:31:38,700
Anyway, I have to have a nap.

1168
01:31:39,327 --> 01:31:45,165
So, call me when the break is over.

1169
01:31:47,210 --> 01:31:52,088
Well you have like 2 minutes or less
for your nap.

1170
01:32:09,857 --> 01:32:14,236
Taylor?
