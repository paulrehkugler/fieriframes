That's the last one.

22
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:55,549
Darn. One more and we would've
had a perfect pyramid.

23
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:58,018
Why don't we use this one?
No, Balki, no.

24
00:01:58,085 --> 00:02:00,354
What? Perfect.

25
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:05,293
Obviously, you don't know
the first thing about physics.

26
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:10,898
Morning, gentlemen.
And I use the word incorrectly.

27
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:13,601
Good morning,
Mr. Twinkacetti.

28
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:14,835
Ha.

29
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:19,540
Oh, look what you got,
you lucky son of a goat.

30
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:23,744
It's my driver's license.
I just got it renewed.

31
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,746
Congratulations.

32
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:28,482
Oh, to get an official
document like that

33
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:30,918
must make you so aroused.

34
00:02:36,224 --> 00:02:39,893
Oh, it's a wonderful thing,
a driver's license.

35
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,396
I don't have
a driver's license.

36
00:02:42,463 --> 00:02:44,298
And I want to thank you both

37
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:48,001
for letting me hang out
with you anyway.

38
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:51,239
What are you talking about?
Your driver's license.

39
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:54,408
Your membership card
to the American dream.

40
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:56,477
Balki, it's only
a driver's license.

41
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:59,380
Only a driver's license?

42
00:02:59,447 --> 00:03:02,750
Is the Lincoln Memorial
only a building?

43
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:07,187
Is Mount Rushmore
only a chunk of stone?

44
00:03:07,255 --> 00:03:11,259
Is Merv Griffin
only a talk show host?

45
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:15,796
Well, it's hard to argue
when you put it like that.

46
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:18,266
Didn't you have a driver's
license back in Mypos?

47
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:20,200
Well, we only had one car.

48
00:03:20,268 --> 00:03:24,438
My family only had one car.
My country only had one car.

49
00:03:25,373 --> 00:03:28,909
Which is a good thing

50
00:03:28,976 --> 00:03:32,012
Come on, Twinkacetti, Balki
could get a driver's license.

51
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:38,652
I could?
Sure.

52
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,288
That doesn't
make any difference.

53
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:42,923
You can still get
a driver's license.

54
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,893
You're teasing Balki.
No. It's no big deal.

55
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,597
All you need is someone
to teach you how to drive.

56
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:51,899
Will you teach me?
Well, sure.

57
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,601
I'm your friend.

58
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,102
In your car?

59
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,137
Uh, in my car?

60
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:59,907
Uh, Balki, I don't think
that's a good idea.

61
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:04,945
Why not?

62
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:07,548
I mean, my car
is very special to me.

63
00:04:07,615 --> 00:04:11,452
I spent years saving nickels
and dimes so that I could...

64
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,456
I mean, it's not that
I don't trust you.

65
00:04:15,523 --> 00:04:18,992
It's just that, uh...
Well, see, uh...

66
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:23,196
How can I say this?

67
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,998
That's it.

68
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:30,103
Well, that's not entirely it.

69
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:33,140
Well, that's not true.
Fifty bucks says he can't.

70
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,409
I'm not even gonna
dignify that with a response.

71
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:40,013
Translated, that means your pal
doesn't think you can do it.

72
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:45,753
Put your money
where your mouth is.

73
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:49,156
All right, you got a bet.
And I'll teach him in my car.

74
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,624
You will?
Did I say it?

75
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:52,893
Yes.
Damn.

76
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:55,763
You're on.

77
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:58,432
It's gonna be like
taking candy from a baby.

78
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:00,968
I haven't done that
in a while either.

79
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:04,372
My very own driver's license.

80
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:07,307
I can't wait to hit the highway.

81
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,514
I volunteered my car.

82
00:05:13,581 --> 00:05:16,684
Please, God,
tell me I didn't make a mistake.

83
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:23,524
Was that a yes or a no?

84
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,003
Cousin Larry, I have been
looking at the manuel.

85
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,205
The manuel?
The driving manuel.

86
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:41,675
The driving manuel. Well, you
can't study that too much.

87
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:44,344
I read every day for a week.
That's good.

88
00:05:44,412 --> 00:05:47,648
You said when I have read the
manual and memorized the rules,

89
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:50,484
you would give me my lesson
in front of the wheel.

90
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:51,919
That's behind the wheel.
And see?

91
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:56,657
That's what I'm talking about.

92
00:05:56,724 --> 00:05:59,827
But you promised to teach me.

93
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:03,664
I know, I know.

94
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:06,834
At least until my car
depreciates another year.

95
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,038
Okay. A promise
is a promise.

96
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,073
All right, come on.

97
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:16,444
Okay.

98
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,913
Now, let's pretend
that this is my car.

99
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,015
Oh, poh-poh.

100
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:26,319
You don't trust me
in a real car?

101
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,988
I think we should
get some practice

102
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,323
before we get into
an actual moving

103
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,126
life-threatening motor vehicle.

104
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:35,563
Now, get in the car.

105
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:44,705
Don't you ever,
ever do that again.

106
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,843
What?
You slammed the door.

107
00:06:55,683 --> 00:06:57,918
Well, it's a little
hard to remember

108
00:06:57,985 --> 00:07:00,688
when you're driving
a coffee table.

109
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:03,691
Okay. Now.

110
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:04,958
You got your steering wheel

111
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:07,761
your brake, gear shift,
accelerator.

112
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:10,598
Make sure it's in park
and start it up.

113
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:13,534
Cousin,
there's nothing here.

114
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:16,236
Don't you think it would
be easier in your car?

115
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:18,772
Easier for you,
not for me.

116
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:22,309
All right, look, I'll build you
a little driving simulator.

117
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:25,045
This is your gear shift.

118
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,881
The frozen broccoli
is your accelerator.

119
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:32,586
And the grapefruit
is your brake.

120
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,795
Did you give me the key?

121
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:51,839
What are you doing?
Sunglasses.

122
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:59,012
Buckle up.
Start the car.

123
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:03,551
Okay. Now, put your foot
on the brake.

124
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:06,453
On the brake,
the grapefruit. Good.

125
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,822
Now, put it in drive

126
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:12,693
and slowly, slowly,
give it a little broccoli.

127
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:16,930
And just pull out
into traffic.

128
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,431
Okay. Good.

129
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,601
Now, we're cruising
down the street.

130
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:22,536
A little broccoli,
a little broccoli.

131
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:24,437
Okay, not so fast.
Not so fast.

132
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,739
There's a lot of traffic.

133
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:28,241
This window
too much on you?

134
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:32,212
It's fine.

135
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,681
Now, what I'm gonna do is

136
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:36,717
throw a few emergency
situations your way, okay?

137
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:38,385
Is that all right? Good.

138
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,520
Look out!
Ahhh!

139
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:44,124
Now, that's rule number one.

140
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:47,895
The driver
never ever covers his eyes.

141
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:53,033
Why you did that?

142
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:58,005
I didn't see it.

143
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:01,742
Well, I was busy avoiding
the runaway baby carriage.

144
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:08,481
What runaway baby carriage?

145
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:12,953
All right.

146
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,855
there's no point
in teaching you.

147
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:17,725
I'll do better.
Okay.

148
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:25,398
around the living room before
the accelerator defrosts.

149
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:29,202
And if you don't hit anything,
we'll, uh...

150
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:35,008
Oh, thank you, Cousin Larry.
Don't worry, I'll be careful.

151
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:48,021
Okay.

152
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:51,158
Next time, buckle up.
It's the law.

153
00:09:58,065 --> 00:09:59,399
SUSAN:
Balki, what happened?

154
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:02,369
I had an accident
in Cousin Larry's car.

155
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,404
Oh, no. Was anybody hurt?

156
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:07,040
Unfortunately, I lived.

157
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:12,913
...seven, eight, nine, 10.
Larry, what happened?

158
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,615
Not now, I'm counting
to a thousand.

159
00:10:15,683 --> 00:10:16,984
What happened?
LARRY: What happened?

160
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,419
What happened?
He is what happened.

161
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:21,354
We were practicing parking
at the supermarket

162
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:23,824
when all of a sudden this
runaway shopping cart

163
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:25,893
came hurtling across
the lot right at us.

164
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,229
A shopping cart?
A hurtling shopping cart.

165
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:32,332
I told you to hit the brake.
Yes, but you confused me.

166
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,335
You keep shouting, "Hit the
grapefruit! Hit the grapefruit!"

167
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:38,471
And I cannot remember is it
brake or gas, the grapefruit.

168
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:41,174
Couldn't remember?
It's the brake. It's the brake.

169
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:46,379
Grapefruit is the brake.
Who doesn't know that?

170
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:50,217
The point is the cart plowed
right into my front fender.

171
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:52,986
Oh, cousin, l know you
never can forgive me.

172
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:56,556
I was a fool to think that
ever I could have a license

173
00:10:56,623 --> 00:11:01,895
like a real American.

174
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:03,997
Balki.

175
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:09,269
No. I am the lowest
form of life.

176
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:12,940
I am a car butcher.

177
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:18,245
According to Mypos custom,
I have to go far away

178
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:21,314
and cover my face
in shame.

179
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:24,284
Goodbye.

180
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:31,191
I hate these old customs.

181
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,430
Balki. Balki.

182
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:12,399
Balki, I'm sorry.

183
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:16,269
It's just that it's my car
and it's your fault.

184
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:20,473
No, no, no. I mean,
I didn't mean to say that.

185
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:25,145
I-I overreacted. I owe you
an apology. I'm sorry.

186
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:29,382
I was more concerned
about my car than your feelings.

187
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:31,184
No, you were right.

188
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:35,455
I am a lowly immigrant
who dared to dream.

189
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:39,259
Don't talk like that.

190
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:41,228
I don't deserve
a driver's license.

191
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:44,464
I don't even deserve
a library card.

192
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:49,837
I would probably be arrested
for speed reading.

193
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,107
Things don't always come easy.

194
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:57,477
It wasn't easy for you
to pack up and come to America.

195
00:12:57,544 --> 00:12:59,312
You found me.
You found a job.

196
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:02,149
You found a place to live.
That was tough.

197
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:05,418
And you're not a quitter.
You know why?

198
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:08,521
I give up. Why?

199

201
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:27,374
That's why you came to America.

202
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,478

the American spirit is about.

Cousin Larry, you'll
let me use your car again?

Yes.

224
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:48,721
I'll show it who's boss.
That's the spirit.

225
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:50,290
Cousin Larry?
What?

226
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:54,094
Let go the key.
I'm trying. I'm really trying.

227
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,983
Nervous?

228
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:19,119
Of course not.
Don't be ridiculous.

229
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:25,692
Backwards?
It's a figure of speech.

230
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,795
There's one question I have
to ask you about the manuel.

231
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:31,864
If four persons come to a
four-way stop at the same moment

232
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,535
and the man on my right has the
right of way, who goes first?

233
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:38,638
Because everybody
has somebody on his right.

234
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,543
That's why you buy insurance.
Thank you.

235
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:48,848
I'm very nervous.

236
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:50,583

00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:54,487

No, this my Cousin Larry.

00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:26,253
You, see the eye chart?

247
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:30,390
Yes, I see it.
Boy, that was an easy test.

248
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:34,027
Cover the left eye,
please.

249
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,130
Your left or my left?

250
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:39,632
Your left. My right.

251
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:47,407
Take your hand off my face.

252
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,777

254
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:56,449
Cover the other eye.

255
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:02,021
Uncover the left eye.

256
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,597
What's the last line
you can read?

257
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:15,368
"Copyright 1963. Printed

Okay. I'll give that to you.

00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:26,546
You see, Larry?
I passed the eye test.

261
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:29,449
See? All that
studying paid off.

262
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:32,585
Here's your written test.
Over there.

263
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,960
All right, now take your time.

264
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:45,998
Uh, excuse me. Cousin Larry,
you're getting on my nerves.

265
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,668
I'm sorry, it's just that
getting a driver's license

266
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:52,539
is very important to him.

267
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:56,476
Yes, right. No problem. I know
you live with a lot of stress.

268
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:02,582
What's the matter?

269
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:07,487
Nothing. I have finished.

270
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:10,923
I think my friend here may
have made a hasty act here.

271
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:14,594
Cousin, relax. I may be nervous,
but I know my Gs and Us.

272
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:17,664
That's Ps and Qs.
I didn't know that.

273
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,432
Okay, one wrong.

274
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:22,335
One wrong? One wrong,
Balki, that's great.

275
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:24,637
I got one wrong?
Only one. That's fantastic.

276
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:28,175
I got one wrong?
It's okay. You passed.

277
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:34,181
You must have made a mistake.

278
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:35,448
I demand a recount.

279
00:18:35,515 --> 00:18:38,485
No, Balki.
Balki, let it go.

280
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:46,826
I knew I was right.

281
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:49,529
I'm sorry. All out
of little gold stars.

282
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:52,599
What about a little happy face?

283
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:59,206
Balki, you've gotta
be nice to these people.

284
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:01,140
If that man was your
driving examiner,

285
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,009
you'd be in
a lot of trouble.

286
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,844
Let's go.

287
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:09,282
On this part of the test, you're
only allowed three mistakes.

288
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:11,484
Where's your car?
In front.

289
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:14,821
In the red zone?
That's one.

290
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:32,372
I told you
all sales are final.

291
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:39,912
Listen, sister, look behind
your TV. Do you see me there?

292
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:43,450
There's your answer.

293
00:19:44,451 --> 00:19:47,420
Those nuns are so pushy.

294
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:51,023
Is Balki here?
I can't find him.

295
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,493
He went for his driver's test
two hours ago

296
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,463
and never came back.

297
00:19:56,529 --> 00:20:00,166
You lost your car?
You lost the bet. Pay me.

298
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:02,101
He could be lying out
there injured.

299
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:03,736
How can you think of money?

300
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:07,474
Easy, I'm not a nice person.
Now, pay me.

301
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:10,743
Balki, you're alive.

302
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,446
Yes, I think so.
I have to sit down.

303
00:20:13,513 --> 00:20:17,417
Get the man a chair.
What happened? I was worried.

304
00:20:17,484 --> 00:20:19,552
I tried to call you
from the hospital,

305
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:21,254
but the phones were being used.

306
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:23,323
The hospital?
You were in the hospital?

307
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:27,394
I didn't want to get on the
expressway, but I got confused.

308
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,762
You're not supposed to be
on the expressway.

309
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:33,966
I know, but I said to him,
"You want to take a left?"

310
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:36,603
And he said, "Right." So...

311
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:41,240
Frank and me were
on the expressway

312
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:42,775
in the middle of rush hour.

313
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:45,244
I don't know why
they call it rush hour

314
00:20:45,312 --> 00:20:47,246
because nothing moves.

315
00:20:47,314 --> 00:20:48,915
Who is Frank?

316
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:52,319
That grumpy guy from
the driver's license store.

317
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:54,987
The one who had
a heart attack.

318
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:56,923
Frank had a heart attack?

319
00:20:56,989 --> 00:21:00,793
Well, no. It turns out
what he had was a bad lunch.

320
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:05,698
A salami sandwich, French fries
and two chili dogs.

321
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:09,402
Nice guy, but he had
more gas than Exxon.

322
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:16,809
You're breaking
my heart, eh?

323
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:19,211
You're really enjoying
this, aren't you?

324
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,514
Human suffering is my thing.

325
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:23,783
Suffer this.

326
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,288
You got it?
You got it?

327
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,860
You got it!

328
00:21:33,926 --> 00:21:36,295
Frank was so happy
he wasn't dead

329
00:21:36,363 --> 00:21:38,765
that he gave me
my driver's license.

330
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,604
Excuse me a moment.

331
00:21:49,175 --> 00:21:51,444
Hey, but we had fun, didn't we?

332
00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:54,146
Uh, Mr. Twinkacetti.

333
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:56,849
All right, the money. Okay.

334
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:03,723
So my kid misses Christmas.

335
00:22:06,593 --> 00:22:09,128
Balki, you did it.
I'm proud of you.

336
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:12,298
Thank you,
Cousin Larry.

337
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:15,702
when I was ready
to throw up the towel.

338
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:19,171
Beautifully put. But you're
the one who passed the test.

339
00:22:19,238 --> 00:22:21,574
Yes, but I was ready
to be a quitter

340
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:24,343
and give up my part
of the American dream.

341
00:22:24,411 --> 00:22:26,078
But you wouldn't let me.

342
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:27,614
Instead, you had faith in me

343
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,116
and you trusted me
with your car.

344
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,653
Well, trust is what
friendship is all about.

345
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,822
And you didn't even
worry about your car.

346
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:39,358
I never gave it a thought. Did
you put on the parking brake?

347
00:22:39,426 --> 00:22:42,762
Of course I did.
Don't be ridiculous.

348
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:51,771
Larry Appleton,
you are the best friend

349
00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:55,007
this Mediterranean
sheepherder ever had.

350
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,444
Thanks.

351
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,779
What do you say
we go out and celebrate?

352
00:22:59,846 --> 00:23:02,749
It's on Twinkie.
Where are the car keys?

353
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:06,653
Oh, they're nice and safe.
I locked them in the car.
