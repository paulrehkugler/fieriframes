1
00:00:01,991 --> 00:00:04,960
<i>It all started when a time travel
experiment I was conducting... </i>

2
00:00:05,027 --> 00:00:07,962
<i>went... a little caca. </i>

3
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:11,522
<i>In the blink of a cosmic clock, </i>
<i>I went from quantum physicist... </i>

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,967
<i>To air force test pilot, </i>

5
00:00:15,037 --> 00:00:18,438
<i>which could have been fun</i>
<i>if I knew how to fly. </i>

6
00:00:18,507 --> 00:00:22,341
<i>Fortunately, I had help... </i>
<i>an observer from the project named Al. </i>

7
00:00:22,411 --> 00:00:26,711
<i>Unfortunately, Al's a hologram, </i>
<i>so all he can lend is moral support. </i>

8
00:00:26,782 --> 00:00:29,774
<i>Anyway, here I am, </i>
<i>bouncing around in time, </i>

9
00:00:29,852 --> 00:00:31,786
<i>putting things right</i>
<i>that once went wrong... </i>

10
00:00:31,854 --> 00:00:35,881
<i>a sort of time-traveling Lone Ranger</i>
<i>with Al as my Tonto, </i>

11
00:00:36,959 --> 00:00:39,359
<i>and I don't even need a mask. </i>

12
00:00:39,428 --> 00:00:41,419
Oh, boy.

13
00:01:56,438 --> 00:01:57,871
<i>If you're going to</i>
<i>quantum leap through time, </i>

14
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,408
<i>you have to be ready</i>
<i>to leap at a moment's notice... </i>

15
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:05,046
<i>to help your fellow traveler, </i>

16
00:02:06,548 --> 00:02:08,743
<i>to be open to new friends, </i>

17
00:02:08,817 --> 00:02:11,581
<i>to eat and leap. </i>

18
00:02:17,126 --> 00:02:21,222
<i>And to expect... the unexpected. </i>

19
00:02:48,991 --> 00:02:51,585
<i>Oh, my God, I'm a dork. </i>

20
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,288
<i>A dork with teeth that can</i>
<i>pick up radio transmissions. </i>

21
00:02:59,268 --> 00:03:02,465
Oh, boy.

22
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:17,785
<i>From his driver's license, </i>
<i>I discovered... </i>

23
00:03:17,853 --> 00:03:19,946
<i>I had leaped into one Cam Wilson, </i>

24
00:03:20,022 --> 00:03:22,582
<i>a 17-year-old hot-rod jockey</i>
<i>who loved junk food... </i>

25
00:03:22,658 --> 00:03:24,592
<i>and had the zits to prove it. </i>

26
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,685
<i>Maybe it had nothing to do</i>
<i>with the kid I replaced, </i>

27
00:03:26,762 --> 00:03:29,253
<i>but I suddenly had this urge</i>
<i>for a burger and malt. </i>

28
00:03:35,704 --> 00:03:39,640
It's the Mom-mobile!

29
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,676
Hey.

30
00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:44,007
Word is you got smeared
at the underpass.

31
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:46,172
Hey, shame we
weren't racing for pinks.

32
00:03:46,248 --> 00:03:50,412
I could've wiped this eyesore
off the boulevard. Oh, yeah!

33
00:03:50,486 --> 00:03:52,613
Hey, Bobby!
Hey, Bobby!

34
00:03:52,688 --> 00:03:55,816
Hey, Bobby!
Hey, Bob-a-rino!

35
00:03:55,891 --> 00:03:59,850
Bobby.
Bobby!

36
00:03:59,928 --> 00:04:04,126
Hey, hey!
Hey, watch the car!

37
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:06,963
Cam, come here.

38
00:04:19,848 --> 00:04:21,975
We got accepted to the Peace Corps!
Isn't that fantastic?

39
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:26,316
That's... That's, uh, great, Cheryl.

40
00:04:26,388 --> 00:04:28,856
I can't believe we are going.
We are actually going.

41
00:04:28,924 --> 00:04:30,414
Great.

42
00:04:30,492 --> 00:04:32,517
Promise not to tell Mom
and Dad until I do, okay?

43
00:04:32,594 --> 00:04:34,789
- You got it.
- That's right.

44
00:04:34,863 --> 00:04:39,391
We are going to the middle of the
South Pacific to an island called Tonga.

45
00:04:39,468 --> 00:04:41,402
I'm gonna help set up
a food cooperative,

46
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,802
and Bob is gonna teach
the natives new ways to fish.

47
00:04:43,872 --> 00:04:45,806
Right. I'm bringing the beer.

48
00:04:45,874 --> 00:04:49,139
Hey, hey!

49
00:04:49,211 --> 00:04:52,806
Get a room. Bobby,
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby!

50
00:04:52,881 --> 00:04:56,442
Oh, Bobby!

51
00:04:56,518 --> 00:04:58,543
We're gonna go right after
the honeymoon.

52
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,747
First we're gonna take
a train up to San Francisco,

53
00:05:00,822 --> 00:05:03,188
and then we're gonna take
a Peace Corps plane to Hawaii.

54
00:05:03,258 --> 00:05:05,852
We've got to spend a month
at this training center on Oahu...

55
00:05:05,928 --> 00:05:09,078
learning about the languages and
the customs on the Tonga Islands

56
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,558
before we can actually go there.

57
00:05:10,632 --> 00:05:13,999
- Sounds great.
- Here's to Tonga.

58
00:05:15,003 --> 00:05:17,369
- Hey!
- Boys aren't supposed to carry purses.

59
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,499
- Give it back!
- You guys, leave Jill alone!

60
00:05:20,576 --> 00:05:22,703
Come on. Give me it!

61
00:05:22,778 --> 00:05:26,236
- Come on, you guys. That's not nice!
- Give it back to me!

62
00:05:26,315 --> 00:05:28,306
Just stop it!

63
00:05:37,859 --> 00:05:40,657
When are you guys
gonna grow up, huh?

64
00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:43,357
Instead of acting like
a bunch of JD's?

65
00:05:43,432 --> 00:05:45,627
Ooh!

66
00:06:00,649 --> 00:06:02,879
I'm sorry.

67
00:06:02,951 --> 00:06:06,045
Just... They're always
chopping me down.

68
00:06:08,123 --> 00:06:10,250
They're just insecure.

69
00:06:10,325 --> 00:06:15,285
Repressing their sensitivities
and projecting their unconscious fears.

70
00:06:16,298 --> 00:06:18,630
Really?

71
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,793
How do you know all that?

72
00:06:20,869 --> 00:06:23,895
I took Psych 1.

73
00:06:23,972 --> 00:06:26,770
Wow.
Don't you worry about it.

74
00:06:26,842 --> 00:06:30,573
When you get a little bit older, the
Impalas would die to go out with you.

75
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,879
I wouldn't date
any of those weenies.

76
00:06:36,451 --> 00:06:38,976
But I might go out with your brother. Cam?

77
00:06:39,054 --> 00:06:42,251
Yes. He's pretty tough.

78
00:06:42,324 --> 00:06:44,451
You can't pants
a guy with glasses.

79
00:06:44,526 --> 00:06:47,893
He's right. Stop!

80
00:06:47,963 --> 00:06:49,794
What glasses?
Hey!

81
00:06:49,865 --> 00:06:52,095
He's not wearing any underwear.

82
00:06:55,337 --> 00:06:57,271
Up. Go on, go on.

83
00:06:57,339 --> 00:07:01,366
- Come on, Bob.
- No way. I'm not catching hell from Cheryl.

84
00:07:01,443 --> 00:07:03,206
Let's go. To the Dumpster. To the Dumpster.

85
00:07:06,381 --> 00:07:08,679
Get his shirt off.
His shirt's off. Okay.

86
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,547
Okay. On three.

87
00:07:10,619 --> 00:07:13,952
One, two, three!

88
00:07:16,892 --> 00:07:18,723
Two points.
Let's go.

89
00:07:18,794 --> 00:07:20,728
Let's go!
Oh, yeah!

90
00:07:24,366 --> 00:07:29,201
Nice dive, Sam.
See, I gave you a 9. 5 on that dive.

91
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:36,042
I would've given you a 10, uh, except I got a
little Russian blood in me on my mother's side.

92
00:07:38,947 --> 00:07:41,177
Let's go!

93
00:07:41,249 --> 00:07:44,309
Do you want me to tell Cam?
No, don't you dare say a word.

94
00:07:44,386 --> 00:07:47,321
All right! I'm coming!

95
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:49,857
Maybe just a hint, okay?
No, Cheryl, don't, please.

96
00:07:49,925 --> 00:07:51,984
I'll be so embarrassed.

97
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,392
See you later.

98
00:07:54,463 --> 00:07:58,058
You remind me of a stripper
I know in Vegas.

99
00:07:58,133 --> 00:08:01,500
She starts out with
an empty TV shipping carton,

100
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:05,028
and then she ends up with a little
teeny-weeny Kleenex box right over...

101
00:08:05,107 --> 00:08:08,543
Al. Look, I... I could
use a little help here.

102
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:11,170
What help? I can't help.
I'm a hologram.

103
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:18,715
Cam?

104
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:27,057
- Are you naked?
- Do the initials B. A. Mean anything to you?

105
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:28,596
Sort of.

106
00:08:28,663 --> 00:08:31,393
The Impalas are such juveniles.

107
00:08:31,466 --> 00:08:34,401
You know, all they're doing
is repressing their sensitivities...

108
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:37,233
and projecting their unconscious fears.

109
00:08:37,305 --> 00:08:40,206
- Where are your glasses?
- They're around here.

110
00:08:40,275 --> 00:08:41,970
They're around here somewhere.

111
00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:46,612
Cam, did you get
pantsed because of me?

112
00:08:48,984 --> 00:08:50,918
Oh, Cam!

113
00:08:50,986 --> 00:08:53,716
Uh, excuse me, uh...

114
00:08:59,494 --> 00:09:01,724
Ah, young love.
There's nothing like it.

115
00:09:01,797 --> 00:09:03,822
How would you know?

116
00:09:12,307 --> 00:09:14,434
What's this?
Your usual, silly.

117
00:09:14,509 --> 00:09:18,570
Two Pinky burgers, a large order of fries,
a chocolate shake and a cherry Coke.

118
00:09:18,647 --> 00:09:20,581
When you're finished,
I'll be back with your dessert.

119
00:09:22,517 --> 00:09:26,647
Just put a cherry on top of your head. Al.

120
00:09:26,721 --> 00:09:29,519
Al? What year is this?

121
00:09:29,591 --> 00:09:32,287
1961.
Great.

122
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,420
The tail end of the most
immature period in history.

123
00:09:35,497 --> 00:09:37,431
All the guys still drink malts,

124
00:09:37,499 --> 00:09:40,024
drive hot rods and wear
butch wax in their hair.

125
00:09:40,101 --> 00:09:43,559
And the girls all have pillow fights,

126
00:09:43,638 --> 00:09:47,039
chat on the phone, blind dates
and get their panties raided.

127
00:09:47,108 --> 00:09:49,975
Ah, those were the good old days.

128
00:09:50,045 --> 00:09:52,172
Ooh, man, that looks good!

129
00:09:52,247 --> 00:09:54,715
Want a bite?

130
00:09:54,783 --> 00:09:57,149
Oh, sorry.
You're a hologram.

131
00:09:59,454 --> 00:10:02,821
Oh, look at this mint '60 Corvette.

132
00:10:02,891 --> 00:10:05,018
Did you ever notice that
girls never cuddle up to guys...

133
00:10:05,093 --> 00:10:07,027
unless they're driving a fancy car?

134
00:10:07,095 --> 00:10:12,055
I mean, you've never seen a woman throw
herself at a guy in a Rambler. Never!

135
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:14,192
You gonna let a car like that
rule your life?

136
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:16,430
Yes.

137
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:21,475
You know, maybe I'm here
to clear up this kid's complexion.

138
00:10:21,543 --> 00:10:25,172
Looks like he's gonna die of terminal
acne. You're not here for Cam.

139
00:10:25,247 --> 00:10:28,978
According to Ziggy,
there's an 82. 6% chance...

140
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:32,042
you're here to keep Cheryl
from marrying Bob.

141
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,147
- But they look like the perfect couple.
- Yeah, but Ken and Barbie grow up.

142
00:10:36,224 --> 00:10:39,022
Bob ends up selling
used cars for his father...

143
00:10:39,094 --> 00:10:41,892
and getting arrested a lot of times
for drunken driving.

144
00:10:41,963 --> 00:10:42,686
Cheryl?

145
00:10:42,687 --> 00:10:45,660
She never made it to the Peace
Corps and never saw much of the world.

146
00:10:45,734 --> 00:10:48,202
Ziggy's gotta be wrong.
She's bright and alive.

147
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:51,671
I can't see anything stopping
her. Evidently, Bob did.

148
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,265
He also appears
to have been a mean drunk.

149
00:10:54,342 --> 00:10:56,333
He didn't hit her?

150
00:10:56,411 --> 00:10:58,504
Well, let's just say she had...

151
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,048
more than her share of accidental falls.

152
00:11:12,761 --> 00:11:15,457
What's the matter?

153
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:19,364
The first time my sister got married,
she was 17.

154
00:11:20,802 --> 00:11:23,066
Guess she wanted to
get away from the farm.

155
00:11:24,906 --> 00:11:28,706
He drank a lot,
and when he got drunk...

156
00:11:30,145 --> 00:11:31,772
I'm sorry, Sam.

157
00:11:31,846 --> 00:11:34,781
She was too afraid to leave,

158
00:11:35,817 --> 00:11:38,047
too ashamed to tell anyone.

159
00:11:39,487 --> 00:11:42,650
She was my sister... She is
my sister. I should've known.

160
00:11:42,724 --> 00:11:45,955
Maybe I could've helped her.
Maybe I could've...

161
00:11:46,027 --> 00:11:47,961
saved her from a lot of pain.

162
00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:50,725
Yeah, but it...
it wasn't your fault.

163
00:11:53,435 --> 00:11:55,426
Maybe not.

164
00:11:56,671 --> 00:12:01,472
But if I can't stop Cheryl
from marrying Bob, it will be.

165
00:12:10,885 --> 00:12:14,377
<i>Why don't you tip a guy off when</i>
<i>your old man is pussy footing around?</i>

166
00:12:14,456 --> 00:12:17,755
<i>Why'd you wanna come over
here for? What's up, Eddie?</i>

167
00:12:17,826 --> 00:12:20,488
<i>Nothing. </i>

168
00:12:21,863 --> 00:12:25,629
<i>I guess you haven't heard</i>
<i>about me going steady, huh?</i>

169
00:12:27,469 --> 00:12:32,065
<i>You're going steady?</i>
<i>Sure. It's all over school. </i>

170
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,405
<i> Hey. </i>
<i>You going steady with a girl, Eddie?</i>

171
00:12:35,477 --> 00:12:38,640
<i>Sure. Carolyn Schuster. </i>

172
00:12:40,749 --> 00:12:44,276
<i>Carolyn Schuster?
Man, she's kind of pretty. </i>

173
00:12:44,352 --> 00:12:48,584
<i>Well, sure she's pretty. </i>
<i>I ain't going steady with no owls. </i>

174
00:12:48,657 --> 00:12:51,820
<i>What are you laughing at?</i>

175
00:12:51,893 --> 00:12:54,157
<i>Oh, uh, nothing, Eddie. </i>
<i>Nothing at all. </i>

176
00:12:54,229 --> 00:12:57,392
<i>- Uh, I just thought
something seemed funny. </i>

177
00:12:57,465 --> 00:13:00,662
Hey, kiddo.
Hiya, Dad.

178
00:13:00,735 --> 00:13:02,703
Hey, what's wrong?
You can't take a punch anymore?

179
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:07,631
No, no, I just, uh...
I hurt this arm.

180
00:13:07,709 --> 00:13:11,304
Oh, sorry, kid. Got ya! It's all...

181
00:13:11,379 --> 00:13:14,314
Put the gloves on. Go out in
the backyard, huh? Dad. Dad.

182
00:13:14,382 --> 00:13:16,850
That's okay. Dad, that's all right.
I'll just go into my room...

183
00:13:16,918 --> 00:13:18,977
and just slam my head into the wall.

184
00:13:19,054 --> 00:13:21,784
That's my boy.

185
00:13:21,856 --> 00:13:24,222
Oh!

186
00:13:24,292 --> 00:13:26,453
Your Mom's lookin' for you.

187
00:13:26,528 --> 00:13:28,860
She's on the warpath.

188
00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:35,494
That's my boy.

189
00:13:36,938 --> 00:13:39,406
<i>It's too early in the morning
to go look at girls. </i>

190
00:13:45,647 --> 00:13:49,378
Cameron!

191
00:13:51,553 --> 00:13:55,853
Yeah?
I want to see you...

192
00:13:57,258 --> 00:14:00,625
I- gotta change...
Now!

193
00:14:08,436 --> 00:14:10,734
Uh, M-Mom?

194
00:14:20,682 --> 00:14:23,515
Excuse me.

195
00:14:23,585 --> 00:14:26,486
What is this?

196
00:14:28,189 --> 00:14:30,384
- An old Playboy magazine.
- Old?

197
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:34,087
Miss May looks
pretty fresh to me.

198
00:14:34,162 --> 00:14:36,289
Rosa found that wedged
behind your hamper.

199
00:14:36,364 --> 00:14:37,367
She had a conniption fit.

200
00:14:37,368 --> 00:14:39,492
She started crossing herself
and yammering in Spanish.

201
00:14:39,567 --> 00:14:41,797
She sounded worse than
Scooter choking on a fur ball.

202
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:45,237
- Sorry.
- That's four cleaning ladies since October.

203
00:14:45,306 --> 00:14:48,814
This one quits, mister, and
you're grounded for a year!

204
00:14:48,915 --> 00:14:50,243
Okay.

205
00:14:50,311 --> 00:14:54,304
- Where are you going?
- To my, uh, room?

206
00:14:54,382 --> 00:14:57,909
- Well?
- Well, what?

207
00:14:57,986 --> 00:15:01,513
- Where's my kiss?
- Oh, yeah.

208
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,964
Oh, you little sweet...

209
00:15:11,032 --> 00:15:13,159
Oh, Cameron!

210
00:15:24,846 --> 00:15:26,370
Oh, Cam!

211
00:15:26,447 --> 00:15:29,473
Honey, your sister needs your help
with some errands tomorrow.

212
00:15:29,551 --> 00:15:32,782
Would you stop by after
the bridal shower, about 3:00?

213
00:15:32,854 --> 00:15:35,254
Okay, Mom.

214
00:15:35,323 --> 00:15:36,984
Mom.

215
00:15:37,058 --> 00:15:39,993
Is that Tab Hunter
sneaking at my door there?

216
00:15:40,061 --> 00:15:43,963
Get in here, you little heartbreaker.

217
00:15:44,032 --> 00:15:47,968
Sit down.

218
00:15:50,071 --> 00:15:52,403
I know who's got a crush on you.

219
00:15:53,908 --> 00:15:56,206
- Who?
- Jill.

220
00:15:56,277 --> 00:15:59,576
Jill? Jill?

221
00:15:59,647 --> 00:16:02,514
Oh, right. Last week you were
getting up the guts to ask her out,

222
00:16:02,584 --> 00:16:04,814
and now you hardly
know her, huh?

223
00:16:05,987 --> 00:16:08,649
Are you gonna bring her to the wedding?
I don't know. She's awful young.

224
00:16:09,858 --> 00:16:12,349
Okay, what are you now, Mr. Mature?

225
00:16:12,427 --> 00:16:14,361
She's only a year behind you.

226
00:16:14,429 --> 00:16:17,057
What happened
to your shirt there?

227
00:16:17,131 --> 00:16:19,122
Oh, that's...

228
00:16:25,707 --> 00:16:27,766
This is great. If you had
worked on the campaign...

229
00:16:27,842 --> 00:16:31,471
instead of the Nomad,
you could have met him too, you know.

230
00:16:31,546 --> 00:16:33,537
Don't break it.

231
00:16:38,419 --> 00:16:42,913
Remember that time you were leaping
around in that silly Zorro outfit of yours,

232
00:16:42,991 --> 00:16:45,186
and you broke my
"Love Me Tender" record?

233
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:48,093
Well, that's what you get
for leaving it on the floor.

234
00:16:48,162 --> 00:16:50,960
It was on my hope chest, Cam.

235
00:16:52,033 --> 00:16:54,524
I'd let my fingernails
grow real long,

236
00:16:54,602 --> 00:16:58,663
and I grabbed for you, and I
accidentally scratched your face.

237
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,368
Uh, yeah, mm-hmm. And then
you went straight to Mom.

238
00:17:01,442 --> 00:17:05,435
At last you had visible evidence
of how I abused you.

239
00:17:05,513 --> 00:17:07,743
I was so proud of those nails too.

240
00:17:07,815 --> 00:17:11,649
Then Mom cut 'em all off.
Remember? I wanted to kill you.

241
00:17:11,719 --> 00:17:16,315
Well, I'm glad you didn't.
Me too.

242
00:17:21,963 --> 00:17:24,124
Strange,

243
00:17:24,198 --> 00:17:27,827
now that I'll finally be doing
what I've always dreamed of...

244
00:17:27,902 --> 00:17:30,564
It's a little scary.
How did you know?

245
00:17:30,638 --> 00:17:33,334
Oh, I've had the feeling.

246
00:17:33,408 --> 00:17:35,467
You're gonna do great.
You really think so?

247
00:17:35,543 --> 00:17:39,343
I guarantee it.
Oh, what do you know?

248
00:17:39,414 --> 00:17:43,111
Furthest you've ever been away
from home is the Pomona Hospital.

249
00:17:43,184 --> 00:17:44,845
Oh, God!

250
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:49,117
Whoa. Thanks.

251
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,181
Oh, I'm so jittery lately.

252
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,660
Well, you know, uh,
leaving home, getting married.

253
00:17:54,729 --> 00:17:58,426
You got a lot to be jittery about.
Yeah.

254
00:17:58,499 --> 00:18:00,524
Maybe you ought a...

255
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:03,729
take it, you know,
one step at a time.

256
00:18:03,805 --> 00:18:06,035
Wait to get married
until after the Peace Corps.

257
00:18:06,107 --> 00:18:10,100
You know I can't. Bob won't
go unless we get married first.

258
00:18:10,178 --> 00:18:12,408
Why?

259
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,108
He just won't.
I don't know.

260
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,345
Well, maybe he's not
the guy for you then.

261
00:18:20,121 --> 00:18:22,885
What's wrong with Bob? For
starters, he drinks too much.

262
00:18:22,957 --> 00:18:25,152
Cam, he's just celebrating
our wedding...

263
00:18:25,226 --> 00:18:27,217
and graduating
and everything, that's all.

264
00:18:27,295 --> 00:18:29,229
What if he never
stops celebrating?

265
00:18:29,297 --> 00:18:31,094
He won't have
much a choice, will he?

266
00:18:31,165 --> 00:18:33,463
There's not a whole lot
of liquor stores in Tonga.

267
00:18:33,534 --> 00:18:36,298
If he goes to Tonga.
What do you mean by that?

268
00:18:38,606 --> 00:18:41,268
Just a hunch.
I don't believe you.

269
00:18:41,342 --> 00:18:44,869
One minute you think Bob is the greatest,
and the next, you're tearing him down.

270
00:18:44,946 --> 00:18:47,005
Look, I just want
what's best for you.

271
00:18:47,081 --> 00:18:49,072
It's too late for that, isn't it?

272
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:51,584
I'm getting married in three days.

273
00:19:07,068 --> 00:19:10,299
<i>Sometimes my Swiss cheese
memory plays funny tricks on me. </i>

274
00:19:10,371 --> 00:19:13,534
<i>I knew from the sound of the engine</i>
<i>that the cam shaft had a flat lobe, </i>

275
00:19:13,608 --> 00:19:15,784
<i>but I didn't have the
vaguest idea of where</i>

276
00:19:15,785 --> 00:19:17,704
<i>the cam shaft was or how to remove it. </i>

277
00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:19,886
<i>I felt like a newborn calf
walking around its mother, </i>

278
00:19:19,887 --> 00:19:21,579
<i>knowing there was milk
there... somewhere. </i>

279
00:19:21,649 --> 00:19:23,674
I can't set the timing.

280
00:19:23,751 --> 00:19:25,878
That's because there's
a flat lobe on the cam shaft.

281
00:19:25,953 --> 00:19:28,285
The same problem we had
with that Olds last week.

282
00:19:29,891 --> 00:19:32,257
Yeah, yeah, that old Olds.

283
00:19:33,861 --> 00:19:37,353
Well, guess I'm gonna have to
pull the cam shaft.

284
00:19:37,432 --> 00:19:39,559
You... You probably forgot.

285
00:19:39,634 --> 00:19:42,102
I did not.

286
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:44,934
It's okay if you forgot. It's no... No, I didn't.

287
00:19:46,507 --> 00:19:48,098
Show me.

288
00:19:58,853 --> 00:20:02,380
Oh, Tina would look
good without that on.

289
00:20:02,457 --> 00:20:04,687
Al.

290
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:07,785
Hi, Sam.
Oh, you've missed all the fun.

291
00:20:07,862 --> 00:20:11,127
Check out this black number
in the Frederick's of Hollywood box.

292
00:20:11,199 --> 00:20:14,168
I will not check that out.
What are you doing here?

293
00:20:14,235 --> 00:20:19,400
I'm confirming that Ziggy's data
retrieval circuits are fully functional.

294
00:20:19,474 --> 00:20:21,271
- What?
- You see,

295
00:20:21,342 --> 00:20:23,606
he predicted that Cheryl's
lingerie party...

296
00:20:23,678 --> 00:20:26,340
would start precisely at 2:07...

297
00:20:26,414 --> 00:20:28,348
Pacific Daylight Time.

298
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,350
He was eight seconds off.

299
00:20:30,418 --> 00:20:33,114
Al, you didn't stand in here...

300
00:20:33,187 --> 00:20:36,520
and watch Cheryl trying
all this stuff on?

301
00:20:36,591 --> 00:20:38,616
Well, you know, uh...

302
00:20:38,693 --> 00:20:41,355
If you're gonna publish,
you gotta have data.

303
00:20:42,663 --> 00:20:44,597
What are you gonna publish,
a lingerie catalogue?

304
00:20:44,665 --> 00:20:46,599
That's a good idea, Sam.

305
00:20:46,667 --> 00:20:49,659
I could do some inside research,
if you get my drift.

306
00:20:49,737 --> 00:20:52,672
Yeah, I get your drift.
Wha-What else are you here for?

307
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,368
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

308
00:20:55,443 --> 00:20:57,377
Nothing, no.

309
00:20:57,445 --> 00:21:01,313
I thought lingerie was enough.

310
00:21:09,724 --> 00:21:10,965
How many times have I told you

311
00:21:10,966 --> 00:21:13,820
not to come in through the living
room with that grease all over you?

312
00:21:13,895 --> 00:21:17,092
207.
That is not funny.

313
00:21:17,165 --> 00:21:20,566
Sorry. Um, Mom, where's Cheryl?

314
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:27,000
Trying on Mrs. Thompson's
wedding dress.

315
00:21:33,214 --> 00:21:35,148
Mom? Where's Mom?

316
00:21:35,216 --> 00:21:37,241
Mom!

317
00:21:37,318 --> 00:21:39,252
... Mom!

318
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,345
Mom!

319
00:21:48,896 --> 00:21:50,887
What's going on?

320
00:21:54,035 --> 00:21:56,697
Mom wanted me to wear
her wedding dress.

321
00:21:57,905 --> 00:22:01,636
Bob made such a... big deal
out of my wearing his mother's.

322
00:22:01,709 --> 00:22:03,802
I mean, what was I gonna say?

323
00:22:03,878 --> 00:22:05,812
Whose do you want to wear?

324
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,508
I don't know, and I don't care.

325
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:11,518
Everybody's just driving me crazy
with what I should do.

326
00:22:11,586 --> 00:22:14,555
I just can't wait to get
this thing over with.

327
00:22:14,622 --> 00:22:17,819
- You want some help?
- I can do it!

328
00:22:20,861 --> 00:22:22,852
Damn it!

329
00:22:24,632 --> 00:22:26,623
Now can I help?

330
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,744
How'd you get these bruises
on your neck?

331
00:22:43,985 --> 00:22:45,919
I fell.

332
00:22:46,988 --> 00:22:49,422
Did Bob do it?
Don't be silly.

333
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:51,424
He did, didn't he?
No, he didn't.

334
00:22:51,492 --> 00:22:54,620
Don't lie for him!
Drop it, Cam.

335
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:59,058
I can't. You're my sister.

336
00:23:04,171 --> 00:23:06,639
Man, you look gorgeous.

337
00:23:11,345 --> 00:23:14,337
It's bad luck to see me
in my wedding dress.

338
00:23:18,753 --> 00:23:20,744
Hey, buddy.

339
00:23:24,225 --> 00:23:26,159
What the hell is this?

340
00:23:26,227 --> 00:23:28,991
You trying to make up for the bruise?

341
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,034
What are you talking about?
The bruise on Cheryl's neck.

342
00:23:37,104 --> 00:23:41,541
You know, it's... it's the kind you get
when you grab somebody's neck like this.

343
00:23:56,257 --> 00:23:58,384
Tell Cheryl I'll
pick her up at 6:00.

344
00:24:04,598 --> 00:24:06,589
For the rehearsal.

345
00:24:17,912 --> 00:24:22,076
And by the authority vested in me,
I now pronounce you man and wife.

346
00:24:22,149 --> 00:24:24,140
Now you may kiss the bride.

347
00:24:32,493 --> 00:24:34,769
Then you'll both walk down the
aisle and begin a wonderful life...

348
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:35,223
Yeah.

349
00:24:35,296 --> 00:24:37,389
Full of joy and happiness.

350
00:24:37,465 --> 00:24:41,162
I hope you haven't started yet.
Hey, Bill. Mrs. Bill.

351
00:24:41,235 --> 00:24:45,171
- Where the hell have you been?
- Wheeling and dealing to pay for this party.

352
00:24:45,239 --> 00:24:47,673
You're not gonna know
what to do the day of the wedding.

353
00:24:47,742 --> 00:24:49,972
Sure I am. Drink heavily.

354
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:55,840
Hey, sorry, kid.
Had to close a deal.

355
00:24:55,916 --> 00:24:58,476
Sold two units new,
one used.

356
00:24:58,552 --> 00:25:01,282
Great! That's great!

357
00:25:01,355 --> 00:25:04,847
My God, look at this
pretty little thing.

358
00:25:06,327 --> 00:25:09,763
Boy, if Bob didn't see you first,
I'd sweep you up myself.

359
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:12,162
Let's eat.

360
00:25:17,238 --> 00:25:21,572
I'm sorry, dear. He just started
celebrating a little early.

361
00:25:26,046 --> 00:25:28,037
Like father, like s...

362
00:25:30,217 --> 00:25:32,913
Do me a favor and punch me
somewhere else, okay?

363
00:25:32,987 --> 00:25:35,478
Oh. Okay.

364
00:25:39,693 --> 00:25:42,890
And she said,
"Of course you can.

365
00:25:42,963 --> 00:25:45,227
That's where lawyers come from".

366
00:25:49,537 --> 00:25:54,497
<i>Leaping about in time, I've suffered</i>
<i>some humiliation and abuse. </i>

367
00:25:54,575 --> 00:25:56,600
<i>But I can't recall</i>
<i>anything as horrible... </i>

368
00:25:56,677 --> 00:25:59,339
<i>as being forced to sit</i>
<i>at the children's table. </i>

369
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:16,489
All right. All right, everybody.

370
00:26:16,564 --> 00:26:19,465
Listen up. First of all,

371
00:26:19,533 --> 00:26:21,501
I'd like to thank...

372
00:26:21,569 --> 00:26:24,470
the most important person here.

373
00:26:25,773 --> 00:26:27,764
The wine waiter.

374
00:26:34,415 --> 00:26:37,680
No, but seriously,

375
00:26:37,751 --> 00:26:40,151
we're all here on this
very special occasion...

376
00:26:41,155 --> 00:26:44,716
the marriage of my firstborn, Bob,

377
00:26:44,792 --> 00:26:47,192
and his lovely bride, Cheryl.

378
00:26:49,563 --> 00:26:52,999
So I'd like you all
to raise your glasses...

379
00:26:53,067 --> 00:26:55,001
and join me in a toast...

380
00:26:55,069 --> 00:26:58,505
to these two wonderful, wonderful...

381
00:26:58,572 --> 00:27:01,200
wonderful kids.

382
00:27:01,275 --> 00:27:03,175
May you have all the best.

383
00:27:12,953 --> 00:27:15,513
Bobby!

384
00:27:15,589 --> 00:27:18,251
Speaking for Cheryl and myself,

385
00:27:18,325 --> 00:27:20,520
no one knows what
the future will bring us,

386
00:27:20,594 --> 00:27:24,655
but I'm sure it's going to be filled
with lots of joy and happiness.

387
00:27:24,732 --> 00:27:27,997
- Here's to my lovely bride.
- Yeah.

388
00:27:28,068 --> 00:27:31,902
- May our love live forever and ever.
- Here, here.

389
00:27:38,445 --> 00:27:42,472
Yeah, Bobby!

390
00:27:48,455 --> 00:27:52,755
And now, I would like to present
my wedding gift to Cheryl.

391
00:27:52,826 --> 00:27:56,796
- What is it?
- Open it.

392
00:28:05,439 --> 00:28:08,272
Oh, my God!

393
00:28:08,342 --> 00:28:10,367
It's a color TV.

394
00:28:19,053 --> 00:28:20,884
I'd like to make a toast.

395
00:28:24,959 --> 00:28:27,257
<i>The Mom-mobile's
gonna make a speech!</i>

396
00:28:32,232 --> 00:28:34,325
I'd like to make a toast.

397
00:28:34,401 --> 00:28:37,768
First, to my sister, Cheryl,

398
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:42,002
I just want you to know how proud
I am to have you as my big sister.

399
00:28:43,978 --> 00:28:47,379
You're a person with
incredible strength and vision.

400
00:28:47,448 --> 00:28:51,544
A person brave enough to answer
President Kennedy's call to...

401
00:28:51,619 --> 00:28:53,644
"ask not what your country
can do for you,

402
00:28:53,721 --> 00:28:56,019
but what you can do
for your country. "

403
00:28:57,625 --> 00:29:01,322
I'm so proud of you for having
the courage to go out...

404
00:29:01,395 --> 00:29:05,661
and make a difference in the lives
of people less fortunate than ourselves.

405
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:10,267
So, hum...

406
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,800
I'd also like to
make a toast to Bob.

407
00:29:15,876 --> 00:29:18,310
I understand there's no electricity
on the island of Tonga and...

408
00:29:18,379 --> 00:29:22,839
Well, thanks to your gift,
I'll be watching Bonanza in color.

409
00:29:27,521 --> 00:29:30,285
That was an impressive
little speech, Sam.

410
00:29:30,357 --> 00:29:32,587
I'm touched.

411
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:35,823
Al, I gotta find a way
to get her out of this wedding.

412
00:29:35,896 --> 00:29:38,421
Hey, hey, hey, hey, check it out.
Hey.

413
00:29:38,499 --> 00:29:41,696
Camikazi's lost it, man.
He's talking to himself.

414
00:29:41,769 --> 00:29:43,930
Watch this.

415
00:29:44,004 --> 00:29:46,370
- Oh, man.
- She won't listen to me.

416
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,908
I mean, she thinks of me
as her dorky little bro...

417
00:29:55,115 --> 00:29:58,607
Food fight! Food fight!
I like food fights.

418
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:02,380
Well, some of the time,
not all of the time.

419
00:30:04,825 --> 00:30:08,693
I think we should, uh,
go to the restroom.

420
00:30:08,762 --> 00:30:11,162
But I don't have to go.

421
00:30:16,236 --> 00:30:19,569
That was good.
It came down to the fact...

422
00:30:20,641 --> 00:30:23,235
It started already, Al.

423
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:27,542
I found a bruise on Cheryl's neck, and when
I asked her about it, she said she fell.

424
00:30:27,614 --> 00:30:31,277
I could never understand why women
cover up for monsters like that.

425
00:30:31,351 --> 00:30:33,581
What are you gonna do?
I don't know.

426
00:30:35,355 --> 00:30:40,054
I asked her to delay the wedding
until after the Peace Corps, but...

427
00:30:40,127 --> 00:30:42,118
No go, huh?

428
00:30:44,665 --> 00:30:47,133
Would you listen to me?

429
00:30:47,201 --> 00:30:48,930
I see your point.

430
00:30:51,305 --> 00:30:54,706
Hey, mister, who you talking to?

431
00:30:57,845 --> 00:30:59,779
Uh,

432
00:30:59,847 --> 00:31:01,712
I, uh... I was just...

433
00:31:01,782 --> 00:31:05,115
I'm an actor, and I was just
kind of, you know, doing a scene.

452
00:32:00,474 --> 00:32:03,034
- Nah.
- Hey, is that that new dance?

453
00:32:04,111 --> 00:32:06,807
No, Dad.
The twist goes like this.

454
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,906
Hey, now, I can still
dance you off the floor.

455
00:32:09,983 --> 00:32:12,008
Hey, Dad, take it easy.
Whoa.

456
00:32:12,085 --> 00:32:16,647
You're not as young as you
used to be. Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!

457
00:32:16,723 --> 00:32:20,625
You're right about that. That's
why I took you for a partner, right?

458
00:32:21,695 --> 00:32:23,629
Why, that dirty crumb!
Shh, shh, shh.

459
00:32:23,697 --> 00:32:25,722
What "shh"?
They can't hear me.

460
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:28,529
Al, but...
They can't see me.

461
00:32:28,602 --> 00:32:31,093
When are you gonna tell her?
After the honeymoon.

462
00:32:31,171 --> 00:32:34,698
What about tonight?
I'm taking you into the business.

463
00:32:34,775 --> 00:32:39,178
I'm buying you a house for a
wedding gift, and nobody knows it.

464
00:32:39,246 --> 00:32:41,441
That ain't fair, son.
Dad, I understand.

465
00:32:41,515 --> 00:32:45,076
But Cheryl's gonna go nuts when I tell
her we're not joining the Peace Corps.

466
00:32:45,152 --> 00:32:49,145
Son, she's 22 years old.

467
00:32:49,223 --> 00:32:51,157
She'll own her own house.

468
00:32:51,225 --> 00:32:53,955
She's got a husband
who's a used car manager.

469
00:32:54,027 --> 00:32:58,088
- What girl wouldn't go nuts?
- Dad she's hot about this Peace Corps thing.

470
00:32:58,165 --> 00:33:00,099
- What about you?
- Me?

471
00:33:00,167 --> 00:33:03,159
Teaching a bunch of headhunters
how to fly-fish? No way.

472
00:33:03,237 --> 00:33:05,899
You know, your mother
wanted to go to college.

473
00:33:05,973 --> 00:33:08,066
My getting her pregnant
with you fixed that.

474
00:33:08,141 --> 00:33:11,042
Get the picture?
Yeah!

475
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:19,413
You know, normally I'm against
spreading men's room gossip.

476
00:33:19,486 --> 00:33:22,387
But in this case...
It would be criminal not to.

477
00:33:22,456 --> 00:33:25,687
Women were made to look at.
Impalas were made to drive.

478
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:29,559
- Tequila's made for shooting, so...
- See you on the other side.

479
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:32,019
Bobby, are we going
to the Peace Corps?

480
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:32,895
Yeah.

481
00:33:32,966 --> 00:33:35,560
Then why did you accept
a job with your Dad?

482
00:33:35,636 --> 00:33:38,867
- Who told you that?
- I did.

483
00:33:38,939 --> 00:33:41,066
I overheard you and your dad
talking in the men's room.

484
00:33:41,141 --> 00:33:44,372
Oh, hiding in the john
Apeeping pervert.

485
00:33:44,444 --> 00:33:46,241
Is it true?

486
00:33:46,313 --> 00:33:48,247
My dad offered me a partnership.

487
00:33:48,315 --> 00:33:51,250
But I didn't want to spoil
the wedding for him, so...

488
00:33:51,318 --> 00:33:53,252
I told him I'd think about it.

489
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,811
- That's a lie.
- Brat, I'm...

490
00:33:55,889 --> 00:33:58,551
Hey, hey! Hey!

491
00:33:58,625 --> 00:34:02,459
Unless you tell me the truth right now,
I'm canceling the wedding. Stop it.

492
00:34:02,529 --> 00:34:05,123
The truth is...

493
00:34:05,198 --> 00:34:08,224
that I'm gonna tell him no
after the wedding.

494
00:34:08,302 --> 00:34:10,497
You gonna turn down the house
after the wedding too?

495
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:14,597
Go ahead and ruin that now.
That was supposed to be a surprise.

496
00:34:17,577 --> 00:34:19,511
Come here.

497
00:34:19,579 --> 00:34:21,638
Look, Dad got us a house,

498
00:34:21,715 --> 00:34:23,842
and I thought we could
rent it while we're away.

499
00:34:23,917 --> 00:34:27,478
That way we could have
a beautiful place to come back to,

500
00:34:27,554 --> 00:34:29,818
a place to start a family.

501
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:33,519
- Honey.
- What?

502
00:34:33,593 --> 00:34:34,568
Honey, I love you.

503
00:34:34,569 --> 00:34:37,495
Cheryl, he has no intention
of joining the Peace Corps.

504
00:34:37,564 --> 00:34:40,397
Little brother, I don't know
why you're acting like this.

505
00:34:40,467 --> 00:34:43,834
I guess you think you're
helping out your sister here.

506
00:34:43,904 --> 00:34:45,963
But you're way off base.

507
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:49,202
- Race him for pinks, Sam.
- What?

508
00:34:49,276 --> 00:34:52,837
He said, "You're way off base, " punk.

509
00:34:55,515 --> 00:35:00,953
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey! Let him go. Let him go.

510
00:35:01,021 --> 00:35:04,889
Cam here's just saying
what he thinks is right.

511
00:35:04,958 --> 00:35:07,051
Cam, okay.
Now, that's enough.

512
00:35:07,127 --> 00:35:10,221
Now, I believe him, okay?

513
00:35:10,297 --> 00:35:12,231
Sam, race him for pinks.

514
00:35:12,299 --> 00:35:17,100
I'll race you for pinks.

515
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:19,400
- What?
- Cam, don't be stupid.

516
00:35:19,473 --> 00:35:24,308
Okay, I'm stupid. But I think
the Mom-mobile can take him.

517
00:35:24,378 --> 00:35:27,711
Okay, um,

518
00:35:27,781 --> 00:35:32,809
how about 3:00 pm. Tomorrow
afternoon... at the underpass?

519
00:35:43,797 --> 00:35:46,823
What's so funny? I don't
think this is funny. It's...

520
00:35:51,538 --> 00:35:53,472
Why am I racing for pinks?

521
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,065
I've been up against hot shots
like this Bob before.

522
00:35:56,143 --> 00:35:59,203
As long as they're in control,
you can't shake 'em.

523
00:35:59,279 --> 00:36:02,273
But if he loses to a hunk
of junk like the Mom-mobile,

524
00:36:02,274 --> 00:36:04,342
I guarantee you that Cheryl will see...

525
00:36:04,418 --> 00:36:07,751
the monster behind
that pretty boy mask.

526
00:36:10,257 --> 00:36:13,420
- I think you're right.
- Of course I'm right.

527
00:36:13,493 --> 00:36:17,793
There's one problem. Everybody knows
Bob has the fastest car on the boulevard.

528
00:36:17,864 --> 00:36:21,265
- But he doesn't have nitrous oxide.
- Laughing gas?

529
00:36:21,334 --> 00:36:23,734
Yeah, these guys don't
even know about it yet.

530
00:36:23,804 --> 00:36:26,671
During the race, you shoot it into
the car's intake manifold,

531
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:29,106
and you get a huge
10-second burst of power.

532
00:36:29,176 --> 00:36:31,644
- Ka-za-zoom!
- That's great.

533
00:36:31,711 --> 00:36:34,145
Of course, if you inject
too much, you blow up.

534
00:36:34,214 --> 00:36:37,741
- Blow up?
- Yeah, you know.

535
00:36:37,818 --> 00:36:40,286
Big bang, fire, smoke.

536
00:36:47,194 --> 00:36:50,628
- Are you sure this is gonna work?
- Positive.

537
00:36:51,098 --> 00:36:53,089
Sort of.

538
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:55,157
Okay, come here.

539
00:37:01,174 --> 00:37:04,337
Okay, I made the stopwatch
the on-off switch.

540
00:37:04,411 --> 00:37:08,711
So pressing this button starts
the stopwatch and the laughing gas.

541
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:14,242
Sounds like we got a leak.

542
00:37:16,857 --> 00:37:21,021
There it is. Hand me
that crescent wrench, Cam.

543
00:37:22,429 --> 00:37:25,421
Here you go.

544
00:37:25,499 --> 00:37:30,368
If this works the way you say,
it could be dangerous.

545
00:37:30,437 --> 00:37:32,371
That's why we got the stopwatch.

546
00:37:32,439 --> 00:37:34,703
More than ten seconds and...

547
00:37:34,774 --> 00:37:38,801
This... This thing il blow up.

548
00:37:47,587 --> 00:37:49,578
Here he is.

549
00:37:57,197 --> 00:37:59,859
Didn't think you'd have
the "ganachos" to show.

550
00:38:01,668 --> 00:38:03,659
Where's your pink, man?

551
00:38:07,941 --> 00:38:10,466
Say bye-bye
to the Mom-mobile.

552
00:38:10,544 --> 00:38:15,038
Hey, gonna miss not having
this wreck around anymore.

553
00:38:15,115 --> 00:38:17,106
Where's Bob's pink?

554
00:38:28,295 --> 00:38:31,162
I'll count off the seconds for you.

555
00:38:31,231 --> 00:38:33,358
Out.

556
00:38:39,372 --> 00:38:41,363
Kick butt.

557
00:38:43,143 --> 00:38:45,134
Okay.

558
00:38:46,213 --> 00:38:48,147
Hey, hey, hey,
where you going?

559
00:38:48,215 --> 00:38:50,149
I'm gonna get out and watch.

560
00:38:50,217 --> 00:38:52,447
The best seat in the house
is right here.

561
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:56,250
Okay. I'm not racing if Cheryl's in the car.

562
00:38:56,323 --> 00:38:58,757
She's staying.
Let's go.

563
00:38:58,825 --> 00:39:02,420
- No way.
- What, are you forfeiting?

564
00:39:02,495 --> 00:39:05,953
You chicken to race alone?

565
00:39:06,032 --> 00:39:08,023
Get out.
What?

566
00:39:08,101 --> 00:39:10,160
I said, get out.

567
00:39:10,237 --> 00:39:12,228
All right.

568
00:39:14,307 --> 00:39:16,298
Kiss it good-bye, drip.

569
00:39:20,814 --> 00:39:24,272
All right. Come on, come on,
come on, come on. Let's go!

570
00:39:36,229 --> 00:39:39,995
Ready, get set, go!

571
00:39:46,172 --> 00:39:48,402
Go!

572
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,951
Not yet!
You'll peak too soon!

573
00:40:04,024 --> 00:40:07,357
- Al, I love you.
- Just drive.

574
00:40:11,998 --> 00:40:13,522
Now!

575
00:40:28,748 --> 00:40:31,012
Yeah!

576
00:40:31,084 --> 00:40:35,180
- The Mom-mobile rules.
- I just don't believe it!

577
00:40:35,255 --> 00:40:38,088
Wasn't that a kick in the butt?

578
00:40:49,069 --> 00:40:52,061
Wow!

579
00:40:52,138 --> 00:40:53,833
Cam, look out!

580
00:41:00,714 --> 00:41:02,773
There's your car, pizza face!

581
00:41:02,849 --> 00:41:05,422
You tried to kill him!
You tried to kill my little brother!

582
00:41:05,423 --> 00:41:06,751
- What are you...
- I didn't, did I?

583
00:41:11,491 --> 00:41:14,483
Let's go home, Cam.

584
00:41:14,561 --> 00:41:17,155
Now, wait a minute, baby.
You're staying here with me!

585
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:19,357
The hell I will!

586
00:41:26,005 --> 00:41:28,337
Don't you ever touch
my sister again.

587
00:41:43,757 --> 00:41:47,124
Get him. Get him!

588
00:41:50,764 --> 00:41:53,198
That was definitely
an uncool move.

589
00:42:41,714 --> 00:42:45,309
Still scared?
Uh-huh.

590
00:42:45,385 --> 00:42:48,946
But I'll get over it.
My little brother guaranteed it.

591
00:42:51,357 --> 00:42:54,224
You saved my life.

592
00:42:54,294 --> 00:42:57,229
No, no.
You saved yourself.

593
00:42:59,666 --> 00:43:03,500
<i>Coastliner for Santa Barbara, </i>
<i>San Luis Obispo, and San Francisco... </i>

594
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:05,834
<i>now boarding on track four. </i>

595
00:43:16,182 --> 00:43:18,377
I got a going-away present
for you in the courtyard.

596
00:43:18,451 --> 00:43:21,818
A present?
But... you're the one going away.

597
00:43:21,888 --> 00:43:26,222
Just go to the shoe-shine stand
in the courtyard, okay?

598
00:43:28,828 --> 00:43:30,819
I love you, Cam.

599
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,691
I love you too.

600
00:43:41,307 --> 00:43:46,745
<i>I bless the day I found you</i>

601
00:43:46,813 --> 00:43:52,376
<i>I want to stay around you</i>

602
00:43:52,452 --> 00:43:57,856

603
00:43:57,924 --> 00:44:00,256

00:44:22,348 --> 00:44:24,475
Hi, Sammy.

610
00:44:24,551 --> 00:44:28,612
Hello, Allie boy. Hey, look
what I picked up this morning.

611
00:44:28,688 --> 00:44:31,054
The girl or the car?

612
00:44:31,124 --> 00:44:33,592
Both.

613
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:37,027
I met her at the car auction.
She offered to wax my hood.

614
00:44:37,096 --> 00:44:39,997
Well, she looks like
she does good work.

615
00:44:42,135 --> 00:44:45,104
So tell me, Al.
What happened to Cheryl?

616
00:44:45,171 --> 00:44:50,006
Oh, Cheryl, she's still in the Peace Corps.
She made it a lifetime commitment.

617
00:44:50,076 --> 00:44:52,579
She's in Africa with her
husband at the moment,

618
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:55,241
and they're organizing a
food cooperative in Chad.

619
00:44:55,315 --> 00:44:57,306
That's great.

620
00:44:59,052 --> 00:45:02,385
So?
So... why haven't you leaped?

621
00:45:02,455 --> 00:45:04,446
- Yeah.
- Cam?

622
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:11,428
I think maybe she's the reason.

623
00:45:17,837 --> 00:45:20,806
Cheryl insisted
on the eyelashes.

624
00:45:21,941 --> 00:45:24,637
Feels like they're gonna
fall off. They look great.

625
00:45:24,711 --> 00:45:27,077
You look great.

626
00:45:30,617 --> 00:45:33,677
You know,

627
00:45:33,753 --> 00:45:37,917
I always wished... that you
would be my first real guy friend.

628
00:45:39,626 --> 00:45:42,322
Your... first guy friend?

629
00:45:42,395 --> 00:45:44,329
Well, yeah.

630
00:45:44,397 --> 00:45:48,629
Well, the first one I didn't want
to sock or shoot with spitballs.

631
00:45:48,701 --> 00:45:51,135
Are you trying to
tell me you never...

632
00:45:51,204 --> 00:45:53,399
kissed anyone?

633
00:45:55,274 --> 00:45:57,265
Sam?

634
00:45:57,343 --> 00:45:59,436
Go ahead, do it.

635
00:46:08,054 --> 00:46:10,045
What's wrong?
Sorry.

636
00:46:10,123 --> 00:46:13,650
I just don't want to get
this stuff all over you.

637
00:46:14,894 --> 00:46:18,694
Okay.

638
00:46:18,765 --> 00:46:20,858
I'm ready.

639
00:46:20,933 --> 00:46:23,959
<i>And that you'll always</i>

640
00:46:29,542 --> 00:46:35,642
<i>Let it be me</i>

641
00:46:49,829 --> 00:46:51,520
Oh, boy.
