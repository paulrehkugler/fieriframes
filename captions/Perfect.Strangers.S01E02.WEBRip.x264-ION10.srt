00:01:47,408 --> 00:01:49,210

Hi, Mr. Twinkacetti.

24
00:01:58,252 --> 00:02:00,120
The handicapped
harassing you again?

25
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,658
Boy, Chicago is a big place.

26
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:07,661
If I walked as far
on my little island of Mypos

27
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:12,065
as I just walked I'd be drowning
in the ocean right now.

28
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,834
I'm so lucky to be here.

29
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:17,037
You're so lucky
the Statue of Liberty

30
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:18,872
didn't wave you away.

31
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:22,910
Where have you been?

32
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,746
She said to me, "Would you take
this to my house?"

33
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:29,417
And I said, "of course,"
because it's only 93 blocks.

34
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:30,851
And...

35
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:33,921
And so, when we got there,
I had to hook up the antenna

36
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:40,494
which was on the roof.

37
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:44,298
And they were coming toward me
because they want to peck me.

38
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:50,438
And then they come
and sit on my neck

39
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:53,607
and I don't like that.

40
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,843
And then
the old lady had to come up

41
00:02:55,909 --> 00:03:00,047
and drag me off the roof
like Tippi Hedren.

42
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:02,516
But the TV works like a charm.

43
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,755
What, uh,
what TV did she buy?

44
00:03:08,956 --> 00:03:10,591
Oh, not one from here.

45
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:16,530
It's obvious in his country

46
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:25,739
Balki, that little old lady
took advantage of you.

47
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:29,510
Every panhandler on the block
knows you by your first name.

48
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:30,578
"Sucker."

49
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,681
You gotta stop being so nice.

50
00:03:34,382 --> 00:03:36,617
Okay, you're right.

51
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:38,085
I'll never be nice again.

52
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,854
Let me get that for you.

53
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:42,390
I'll get it.

54
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:44,124

55
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:46,026
Oh, hi, Gus.

56
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:47,895
You're kidding.

57
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,764
Gus, this means a lot to me.
Thanks.

58
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:53,634
Cousin Larry, you were nice
to that person on the phone.

59
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:56,937
I hope he didn't
take advantage of you.

60
00:03:57,004 --> 00:04:01,342
I finally got a break.

61
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:03,277
Dolly Parton
is staying in town secretly.

62
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:05,513

Anyway, iff I can get
a picture of her

68
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:21,295

she's in town

00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:27,701
Cousin Larry, you know, someday
I'm gonna look at you and say

71
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:30,237
"That's my cousin,

73
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,042
And do you know why?

74
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,678
Because you're cracked.

75
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:42,316

TV ANNOUNCER: Door three.
Door number two.

80
00:05:00,568 --> 00:05:02,436
Uh! Unbelievable.

81
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:04,705
BALKI: Cousin Larry,
did you get the picture?

82
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:07,941
I got to the hotel just
as her cab was pulling away.

83
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:10,611
I jumped into another cab
and said, "Follow that car."

84
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:13,046
And in case you're wondering,
they don't do that.

85
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:16,650
BALKI: You've had
a busy day.

86
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:20,854
I gotta get this picture.

87
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:24,157
She checked into a room with
a man who is not her husband.

88
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:26,226
This is a sure sale.

89
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:29,630
If he's not her husband,
what's he doing in her room?

90
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:33,567
Balki, she's having an affair.

91
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:44,445
Dolly Parton wouldn't do that.

92
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,917
Maybe it's her brother.
Yeah.

93
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:52,352
Well, there are newspapers
who'll buy a picture of them,

94
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,087
whoever he is.

95
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:56,490
What if they don't want
their picture taken?

96
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:59,092
They don't. That's what makes
newspapers wanna buy it.

97
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:02,029
Well, don't you think you're
stepping on her privacy?

98
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,965
Look, Balki, in America

99
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:07,568
a famous person gives up
their right to privacy.

100
00:06:07,635 --> 00:06:09,803
And if I'm gonna make it
as a photojournalist,

101
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,139
it's gonna take
a lot of talent and luck.

102
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,676
I've got the talent,
and Dolly Parton is my luck.

103
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:18,378
You want to get lucky
with Dolly Parton?

104
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:25,653
What I'm saying is that people
have a right to know

105
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:29,122
about every aspect
of a public figure's life.

106
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:32,693
Taking a picture of Dolly Parton
is photojournalism?

107
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,898
The journalism
will have to come later.

108
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:44,472
How you did that?

109
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:47,575
Well, it's,
it's a pop-top can.

110
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:49,910
Haven't you ever seen
one of these before?

111
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:53,947
Of course I have,
don't be ridiculous.

112
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,456
I did it.

113
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,760
Now how do I close that?

114
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:16,870
Oh, hi, Linda,
I forgot you were coming.

115
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,306
Oh, well, I hope
you're still gonna be able

116
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:23,511
to look after Gorbachev.

117
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:25,278
Well, I'm flattered.

118
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:28,348
Now, remember, he likes
to be walked at 10 o'clock.

119
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:32,853
If you wait too long

120
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,188
Ten it is.
Maybe 9:30.

121
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:42,162
Well, I'm sure
we can think of something.

122
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:44,665
My flight gets back Tuesday.
Yeah, okay.

123
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:46,900
Bye.
Bye-bye.

124
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:53,040
Great, just what I need.

125
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:55,876
Come on, Gorbachev. If you're
good, we'll feed you a mailman.

126
00:07:55,943 --> 00:07:58,178
Yeah, good boy.
Yeah, good boy.

127
00:07:58,245 --> 00:07:59,547
Okay, stay off the bed.

128
00:08:00,748 --> 00:08:02,315
Yeah, all right.

129
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:03,717
Stretch out.

130
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:08,756
Let me ask you something.

131
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,825
Linda just gave you
a big dog to take care of.

132
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:13,927
Isn't she taking
advantage of you?

133
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,863
Well, there's a difference.

134
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:18,298
See, I'm letting her
take advantage of me

135
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:22,069
in the hope that it will help
bond our relationship.

136
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:26,339
You want to bond with her?

137
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:28,676
Well, she is a stewardess.

138
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:34,414
Whoo!
Whoo.

139
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:36,817
Oh!
Oh.

140
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:42,790
What are we talking about?

141
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:48,696
I'll explain it
some other time, huh?

142
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,735
I thought you were going
to your citizenship class.

143
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:56,570
Well, I'll make it up
on Saturday.

144
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:58,872
I'm sewing
Mr. Twinkacetti's pants.

145
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:00,808
You're sewing
Twinkacetti's pants?

146
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,476
Sure. You want me to sew
something for you?

147
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,914
There you go, letting people
take advantage of you.

148
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,651
You've got to learn to say no.
I can't say no.

149
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:14,054
Balki, would you shine my shoes?

150
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:16,957
Sure.
There, see? You did it again.

151
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:19,459
You've gotta
stand up for yourself.

152
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:21,428
Sit down.

153
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:24,464
Just say no.
No. I'm sorry.

154
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:27,868
No. No, don't say you're sorry.
It takes the edge off.

155
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:29,637
Now, come on, try it again.

156
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:32,840
Balki, would you
please shine my shoes?

157
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:40,714
It would help
if you didn't say "please."

158
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:42,582
Say it.
No.

159
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:43,851
Good.

160
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:50,658
No, I won't
shine your shoes.
Good, keep it going.

161
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:54,227
I would not shine your shoes
if my life depend on it.

162
00:10:00,668 --> 00:10:03,603
You tried to trick Balki.

163
00:10:03,671 --> 00:10:06,907
No shoes, no mustard.

164
00:10:07,675 --> 00:10:09,342
Good, huh?
Very good.

165
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:12,412
I'm very proud of you.
And you'll never do this again.

166
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:14,214
Never again.

167
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:30,330
You bet you will, buddy.

168
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,668
This is fun.

169
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,040
Hello?

170
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:42,575
They did

171
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,078
You're the greatest, Gus.
Thanks.

172
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,513
Balki, Dolly Parton just went

173
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,315
for a walk
with the guy she's with.

174
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:58,291
I gotta hurry
if I wanna catch them.

175
00:10:58,358 --> 00:10:59,793
Balki?

176
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,263
You want me to walk the dog?
Yes.

177
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,033
Don't be ridiculous.

178
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:07,868
No, no.
Now, Balki, Balki.

179
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:09,903
Now, I am desperate,
I am in need.

180
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,139
Aren't we all?
What? No, no.

181
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:15,743
Balki, this is not a test.
I repeat, this is not a test.

182
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:18,045
I am begging you.

183
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:21,348
No way. Uh-uh.

184
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,086
I'm going
to my citizenship class.

185
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:27,955
Balki, you can't do this to me.

186
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:31,258
Who do you think you're
talking to

187
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:32,692
Ha!

188
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,972
Come here, Susan.

189
00:11:46,774 --> 00:11:50,110
Look this.
Hello, Cousin Larry.

190
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:52,179
Hello, Susan.
Hi.

191
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,384
Larry, why aren't you
talking to Balki?

192
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,419
I only talk to my friends.

193
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:05,926
All I know is last night,
he taught me how to say no

194
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:08,095
until I was
very good at saying no.

195
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:10,730
And then I said, "no,"
and he got mad.

196
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:14,234
That's not quite what happened.

197
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:16,669
I had the chance
to get an exclusive photograph

198
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:20,073
of a famous person.

199
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:25,913
And all he had to do was take
Gorbachev for a walk, but no.

200
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:29,983
Gorbachev?
A dog the size of a Buick.

201
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,019
The point...

202
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:36,089
The point is I had
to take the beast with me.

203
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:38,325
When I got close
to take the picture

204
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:39,793
she saw me and took off.

205
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,930
Gorbachev took off after her

206
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:45,232
I tore my clothes.
I sprained my ankle.

207
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:47,234
I probably would've
been dragged to my death

208
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,102
if Gorbachev
hadn't met a stray poodle

209
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:51,939
who was coming off
a bad relationship.

210
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:58,045
All because of this person
who I am not talking to.

211
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,132
Did you like Mypos food?

212
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:27,274
Cousin Larry,
I don't know what you want.

213
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:29,877
I cook all day for you

214
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:31,411
and still you're
not talking to me.

215
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,882
You told me to say no.

216
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:40,854
I'll make an exception
just to say this.

217
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:42,555
I don't wanna talk about it.

218
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,527
You know, now
you're making Balki mad.

219
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,730
You know, I can pout too.

220
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:52,632
Pouting was invented on Mypos.

221
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:54,902
You haven't seen pouting
until you've seen

222
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:57,137
the Mypos kiss of silence.

223
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:03,476
Okay, wise eyes,
you asking for it.

224
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:21,995
Don't you ever,
ever do that again.

225
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:30,403
Hello.

226
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,939
Hello, Gus.

227
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:34,975
No, he's in the bathroom,
not talking.

228
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,077
What?

229
00:14:37,144 --> 00:14:39,179
What is that about Dolly Parton?

230
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:41,848
Oh, my Cousin Larry
would love to hear that.

231
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:43,516
...Dolly Parton. Bye.

232
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,954
Who was that?
Was that Gus from the hotel?

233
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,355
He say something
about Dolly Parton?

234
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:50,223
Did he say she's going out?

235
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:12,112
What do you think, huh?

236
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:14,147
You're not dealing
with a dimwit here.

237
00:15:18,185 --> 00:15:20,253
Gus went on his break.

238
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:36,103
Balki, I'd like to apologize.

239
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:39,006
I was wrong,
I'm sorry I pouted. There.

240
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:42,642
Now, tell me what he said.

241
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:45,545
Balki, I apologized.

242
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:48,315
You didn't mean it.

243
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:57,224
You know, on Mypos,
we have a way

244
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,891
of showing an apology is real.

245
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,627
Tell me. I'll do it.

246
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,029
Well, first you pluck a chicken.

247
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:03,430
Balki.

248
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:06,699
Okay, we skip the chicken.

249
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,074
I can grovel.

250
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:19,912
The sorry person says,
"I am dirt.

251
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,515
"I am the sweat of a pig.

252
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:29,989
"I am sorry forever."

253
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,160
But it better be convincing.

254
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:38,765
I am dirt.

255
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,333
I am--

256
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,503
What What

257
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:47,107
It's not groveling unless
your head is lower than mine.

258
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:51,478
I am dirt.

259
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:04,391
I am dirt.

260
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:07,026
I am...
The sweat of a pig.

261
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:09,396
The sweat of a pig.
I've got it, I've got it.

262
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:12,899
I am sorry forever.

263
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,267
There. Is that good enough?

264
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:19,106
It's just not the same
without the chicken.

265
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,243
Balki, Balki, please.

266
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,612
Oh, I forgive you.

267
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,418
So we have to do
the Dance of Joy.

268
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,154
All right, good.

269
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:37,023
Now, tell me what Gus said
about Dolly Parton.

270
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,458
She's on the plane to Nashville.

271
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:40,427
No. Ugh!
Just kidding.

272
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:45,365
Cousins should joke more.
Yes, yes, they should.

273
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:48,501
Now tell me what he said.

274
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:53,906
She's in the lounge with the man
who must be her brother.

275
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:55,542
The lounge.

276
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:59,679
Can I come with you?
Okay, okay.

277
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:05,585
I wanna get close enough
to get the picture this time.

278
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:07,487
Why can't I say,
"watch the birdie?"

279
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,667
It's so dark in here.

280
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:24,137
You can't even see your own nose
in front of your face.

281
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,710
There she is.

282
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,980
Oh no, he's leaving. I've gotta
get a picture of them together.

283
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:38,851
Don't you see what's happened?

284
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:42,522
She's going back to her husband
because she's a good person.

285
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:46,626
And now no one will ever know
that they came here together.

286
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:50,930
Until you take
a picture of them

287
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:52,732
and then her life is ruined.

288
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:59,939
What are you doing?

289
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:03,510
I don't think it's right just
because she has a public figure.

290
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:07,214
Balki, give me my camera.
No.

291
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:10,517
Good, huh?

292
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,786
Let's be adult about this.
Give me my camera.

293
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:14,921
No, no, no.

294
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:18,124
Stop. Stop. Don't. Don't.

295
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:19,826
Would you stop?

296
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:26,299
She's not going back
to her husband.

297
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:29,135
They are going to Mexico
to live in sin.

298
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:30,903
Now give me my camera.

299
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:46,819
Balki, get out of my way.
No.

300
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:49,422
I can't let you
invade her privacys.

301
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,998
MAN: Somebody call the police.

302
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:02,602
You're not Dolly Parton.
She's not? But I was told...

303
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,805
You're not Dolly Parton.

304
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:08,475
All right, wise guy, why you've
been following us all over town?

305
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,209
Scared my wife half to death.

306
00:20:10,277 --> 00:20:12,845
I did? I, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

307
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:14,447
I, I just wanted
to get a picture

308
00:20:14,514 --> 00:20:16,616
of a famous person
committing adultery.

309
00:20:19,286 --> 00:20:20,720
I am dirt.

310
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:24,991
I am the sweat of a pig.

311
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:38,305
Why couldn't I see
what I was doing?

312
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:41,374
Well, because it was
very dark at that hotel.

313
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:47,246
I was willing to destroy
a person's reputation

314
00:20:47,314 --> 00:20:50,450
by selling a picture
to a sleazy newspaper...

315
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:56,889
Just to get
my career started.

316
00:20:56,956 --> 00:21:00,560
You tried to tell me that,
but I wouldn't listen.

317
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,737
I have no integrity.
Of course you do.

318
00:21:11,538 --> 00:21:13,406
You full of it.

319
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:17,344
What is integrity?

320
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:21,481
Refusing to sell out
to get where you wanna go.

321
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:24,817
If I wanted to be
a photojournalist with integrity

322
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:27,454
what made me think
I could start out this way?

323
00:21:33,192 --> 00:21:35,462
that makes a better person.

324
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:37,897
I learned I was a sleaze.

325
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:40,767
But you can build on that.

326
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,241
In my country, when somebody
learns something

327
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,310
about himself
that is not good

328
00:21:51,378 --> 00:21:53,079
then he changes that.

329
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:57,650
That means he has
what you call integrity.

330
00:21:57,717 --> 00:21:59,752
You should be proud of yourself.

331
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,058
Well, that makes me feel better.

332
00:22:07,527 --> 00:22:09,061
A little better.

333
00:22:18,638 --> 00:22:22,208
Now, cousin,
it would make me happy

334
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:25,077
to do something for you
because you are my friend.

335
00:22:25,144 --> 00:22:26,813
But if I do that for you

336
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:29,015
are you taking advantage of me?

337
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,752
What I meant about that was

338
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:35,855
if you wanna help people,
you should.

339
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:38,625
But you shouldn't do it
because you feel you have to.

340
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:41,761
Oh.

341
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,666
What a wonderful day we've had.

342
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:50,269
You have learned something,
and I have learned something.

343
00:22:50,336 --> 00:22:51,971
Too bad
we didn't learn it sooner

344
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:54,574
we could have gone
to the movies instead.

345
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:01,714
Cousin Larry?
What?

346
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:03,950
Goodnight.

347
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,119
Goodnight, Balki.
