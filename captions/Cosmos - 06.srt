1
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,564
SAGAN: Imagine that we are travelers
from the stars...

2
00:00:54,767 --> 00:00:57,099
...bound for the sun.

3
00:00:57,303 --> 00:01:02,240
We would discover it surrounded by
four giant, cloudy, gas worlds:

4
00:01:02,742 --> 00:01:06,269
Blue Neptune and its
frozen moon, Triton.

5
00:01:09,148 --> 00:01:13,346
And then farther in, Uranus
and its dark rings...

6
00:01:13,553 --> 00:01:16,852
...made perhaps of organic matter.

7
00:01:32,204 --> 00:01:36,766
Saturn, the jewel
of the solar system...

8
00:01:37,209 --> 00:01:41,111
...set within concentric rings...

9
00:01:41,314 --> 00:01:46,013
...composed of a billion icy moons.

10
00:01:57,797 --> 00:02:02,496
And finally, flanked by massive
satellites...

11
00:02:02,702 --> 00:02:06,001
...the largest planet, Jupiter.

12
00:02:06,472 --> 00:02:08,337
Its multicolored clouds...

13
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:11,806
...studded with flashes of lightning.

14
00:02:16,782 --> 00:02:18,613
Still farther in...

15
00:02:18,985 --> 00:02:21,249
...closer to the sun...

16
00:02:21,621 --> 00:02:24,215
...there are no more
giant planets...

17
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:27,957
...only a host of lesser worlds...

18
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,492
...made of rock and metal...

19
00:02:30,696 --> 00:02:34,291
...some with a thin envelope of air.

20
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,127
They huddle about the sun...

21
00:02:36,335 --> 00:02:39,600
...with almost no internal heat of
their own...

22
00:02:40,172 --> 00:02:43,471
...tiny places with solid surfaces...

23
00:02:43,676 --> 00:02:47,544
...one of which is a blue
and pretty world...

24
00:02:47,747 --> 00:02:49,305
...called Earth.

25
00:02:50,383 --> 00:02:52,010
Half-covered with clouds...

26
00:02:52,218 --> 00:02:54,277
...it is the home planet
of travelers...

27
00:02:54,487 --> 00:02:57,820
...who have just learned to sail
the sea of space...

28
00:02:58,157 --> 00:03:00,455
...to investigate close-up...

29
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,356
...Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and
Neptune...

30
00:03:03,562 --> 00:03:08,329
...its brothers and sisters
in the family of the sun.

31
00:03:15,241 --> 00:03:18,733
Human voyages of exploration
to the outer solar system...

32
00:03:18,944 --> 00:03:23,210
...are controlled, so far, from a
single place on the planet Earth...

33
00:03:23,783 --> 00:03:25,444
...the Jet Propulsion Laboratory...

34
00:03:25,651 --> 00:03:28,211
...of the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration...

35
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:30,981
...in Pasadena, California.

36
00:03:36,162 --> 00:03:40,121
Here on Sunday, July 8th, 1979...

37
00:03:40,332 --> 00:03:42,266
...the Voyager 2 spacecraft...

38
00:03:42,468 --> 00:03:45,926
...began its close passage
by Jupiter and its moons.

39
00:03:52,478 --> 00:03:53,968
General science systems...

40
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,943
JPL MAN:
...are you ready with status check?

41
00:03:56,148 --> 00:03:57,206
Yes, I am.

42
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,483
SAGAN:
The spacecraft had been instructed...

43
00:03:59,685 --> 00:04:01,448
...how to explore
the Jupiter system...

44
00:04:01,654 --> 00:04:03,622
...by a sequence of commands
radioed earlier...

45
00:04:03,823 --> 00:04:05,484
...to its onboard computers.

46
00:04:05,691 --> 00:04:07,625
Power, 450 watts.

47
00:04:07,893 --> 00:04:09,360
Power is go at this time.

48
00:04:09,562 --> 00:04:11,154
DSE systems.

49
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:16,860
LACP mode is far and counter.

50
00:04:17,136 --> 00:04:18,967
We are at take 21 0.

51
00:04:19,171 --> 00:04:22,572
Direction last recorded was reversed,
and the track is track one.

52
00:04:22,775 --> 00:04:26,142
Here we check how faithful
an emissary Voyager is.

53
00:04:27,012 --> 00:04:28,946
Does it understand the commands?

54
00:04:29,148 --> 00:04:31,309
How is its health, its temperature...

55
00:04:31,584 --> 00:04:32,983
...its brains...

56
00:04:33,185 --> 00:04:34,174
...its heart?

57
00:04:35,087 --> 00:04:37,180
Yes, detailed science is coming up...

58
00:04:37,957 --> 00:04:39,822
"A" systems...

59
00:04:40,226 --> 00:04:42,160
...completed the status check...

60
00:04:42,361 --> 00:04:44,386
...and the spacecraft is go.

61
00:04:44,597 --> 00:04:45,586
Roger. Thank you.

62
00:04:45,798 --> 00:04:50,235
SAGAN: The modern ships that sail to
the planets are unmanned.

63
00:04:50,436 --> 00:04:52,165
They are beautifully constructed...

64
00:04:52,371 --> 00:04:55,636
...semi-intelligent robots.

65
00:04:56,242 --> 00:04:58,972
Voyager's eyes are
two television cameras...

66
00:04:59,178 --> 00:05:03,808
...designed to take many thousands
of pictures in the solar system.

67
00:05:04,016 --> 00:05:07,747
Along with other instruments, they are
mounted on a scan platform...

68
00:05:07,953 --> 00:05:10,615
...which points at passing planets.

69
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:15,791
Voyager's brains are three integrated
computers set amidships.

70
00:05:15,995 --> 00:05:18,896
It communicates with Earth
through a radio antenna...

71
00:05:19,098 --> 00:05:21,032
...mounted like a sail.

72
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:24,100
Voyager bears a message
for any alien civilization...

73
00:05:24,303 --> 00:05:27,795
...it may one day encounter
in interstellar space.

74
00:05:28,641 --> 00:05:33,010
Its louvers open and shut to help
control the onboard temperature.

75
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,944
But Voyager cruises
so far from the sun...

76
00:05:37,149 --> 00:05:39,310
...that it cannot depend
on solar power.

77
00:05:39,518 --> 00:05:43,079
Instead, it has a small
nuclear power plant...

78
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:46,417
...quarantined from the rest
of the ship.

79
00:05:55,901 --> 00:05:58,870
Many things can go wrong
in such pioneering missions.

80
00:05:59,338 --> 00:06:01,533
So people are a little uneasy...

81
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,072
...at Voyager mission control.

82
00:06:04,476 --> 00:06:08,037
Jupiter is surrounded by a shell of
invisible but extremely dangerous...

83
00:06:08,247 --> 00:06:10,238
...high-energy charged particles.

84
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,747
If Voyager flies too close...

85
00:06:12,952 --> 00:06:16,080
...its delicate electronics
will be fried.

86
00:06:16,288 --> 00:06:19,485
A collision with a small boulder
in the rings of Jupiter...

87
00:06:19,692 --> 00:06:22,855
...could send the spacecraft tumbling
wildly out of control...

88
00:06:23,062 --> 00:06:26,793
...its antenna unable to find
the Earth, its data lost forever.

89
00:06:32,004 --> 00:06:34,131
Voyager 1 and Voyager 2...

90
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:38,436
...were launched a month apart
in late summer of 1977.

91
00:06:38,644 --> 00:06:40,942
After many alarms and close calls...

92
00:06:41,146 --> 00:06:44,877
...they successfully arrived months
apart at the Jupiter system...

93
00:06:45,084 --> 00:06:46,608
...where they worked brilliantly...

94
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:49,686
...providing the first close-up views
of mighty Jupiter...

95
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:52,722
...and its four large
and mysterious moons:

96
00:06:52,925 --> 00:06:56,554
Io, the innermost of the four...

97
00:06:57,096 --> 00:06:58,586
...Europa...

98
00:06:58,831 --> 00:07:02,096
...and moving away from Jupiter...

99
00:07:02,301 --> 00:07:03,768
...Ganymede...

100
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:08,571
...and the outermost big moon...

101
00:07:08,774 --> 00:07:10,139
...Callisto.

102
00:07:11,844 --> 00:07:16,144
In a mission that costs
a penny a world...

103
00:07:16,348 --> 00:07:19,681
...for every human
on the planet Earth.

104
00:07:26,091 --> 00:07:28,355
Voyager's passage by Jupiter...

105
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,757
...accelerated it towards
the planet Saturn.

106
00:07:31,964 --> 00:07:35,024
Saturn's gravity will
propel it on to Uranus...

107
00:07:35,234 --> 00:07:39,000
...and in this game of cosmic
billiards, after Uranus...

108
00:07:39,204 --> 00:07:43,402
...it will plunge on past Neptune,
leaving the solar system...

109
00:07:43,609 --> 00:07:46,009
...and becoming
an interstellar spacecraft...

110
00:07:46,211 --> 00:07:49,009
...destined to wander forever...

111
00:07:49,214 --> 00:07:51,808
...the great ocean between the stars.

112
00:07:52,017 --> 00:07:55,817
And if Voyager should,
sometime in its distant future...

113
00:07:56,021 --> 00:08:00,720
...encounter beings from
some other civilization in space...

114
00:08:00,926 --> 00:08:03,360
...it bears a message.

115
00:08:03,562 --> 00:08:07,430
A phonograph record.
Golden, delicate...

116
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,195
...with instruction for use.

117
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:15,099
And on this record are a sampling of
pictures, sounds, greetings...

118
00:08:15,741 --> 00:08:18,005
...and an hour and a half
of exquisite music...

119
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,770
...the Earth's greatest hits.

120
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,914
A gift across the cosmic ocean...

121
00:08:23,115 --> 00:08:27,279
...from one island of civilization
to another.

122
00:08:28,887 --> 00:08:32,015
The record bears in English...

123
00:08:32,224 --> 00:08:35,125
...an additional handwritten
greeting that says:

124
00:08:35,694 --> 00:08:40,427
"To the makers of music,
all worlds, all times."

125
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:44,134
These voyages of exploration
and discovery...

126
00:08:44,503 --> 00:08:47,404
...are the latest in a long series
which have characterized...

127
00:08:47,606 --> 00:08:50,973
...and distinguished
the human species.

128
00:08:51,176 --> 00:08:53,406
In the 1 5th and 16th centuries...

129
00:08:53,612 --> 00:08:56,979
...you could travel from Spain
to the Azores in a few days.

130
00:08:57,182 --> 00:09:00,151
The same time it takes now
to cross that little channel...

131
00:09:00,352 --> 00:09:02,411
...from the Earth to the moon.

132
00:09:03,422 --> 00:09:06,789
It took, then, a few months
to traverse the Atlantic Ocean...

133
00:09:06,992 --> 00:09:09,654
...and reach what was called
the "New World"...

134
00:09:09,862 --> 00:09:10,851
...the Americas.

135
00:09:11,063 --> 00:09:14,829
Today it takes a few months
to cross the inner solar system...

136
00:09:15,034 --> 00:09:18,094
...and reach Mars and Venus,
truly and literally...

137
00:09:18,303 --> 00:09:20,498
...new worlds awaiting us.

138
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,637
In the 1 7th and 18th centuries...

139
00:09:23,842 --> 00:09:28,074
...you could travel from Holland
to China, say, in a year or two...

140
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,339
...the same time
it takes now for Voyager...

141
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:32,949
...to travel from the Earth
to Jupiter.

142
00:09:36,722 --> 00:09:40,214
And in comparison to the resources
of the society...

143
00:09:40,426 --> 00:09:43,759
...it cost more then to send
sailing ships to the Far East...

144
00:09:43,962 --> 00:09:47,489
...than it does now
to send spaceships to the planets.

145
00:09:51,236 --> 00:09:53,227
The passion to explore...

146
00:09:53,439 --> 00:09:55,771
...is at the heart of being human.

147
00:09:55,974 --> 00:09:58,704
This impulse to go,
to see, to know...

148
00:09:58,911 --> 00:10:01,436
...has found expression
in every culture.

149
00:10:03,182 --> 00:10:06,640
Africa was circumnavigated
by Phoenician sailors...

150
00:10:06,852 --> 00:10:09,446
...in the employ
of an Egyptian pharaoh...

151
00:10:09,655 --> 00:10:12,681
...in the 7th century B.C.

152
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:16,393
The islands of the Pacific
were settled...

153
00:10:16,595 --> 00:10:20,031
...by skilled and heroic navigators
from Indonesia.

154
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,094
Great fleets of ocean-going junks...

155
00:10:24,303 --> 00:10:27,170
...left the ports
of Ming Dynasty China...

156
00:10:27,372 --> 00:10:30,136
...to explore India and Africa.

157
00:10:30,843 --> 00:10:33,539
A century later,
three ships left Spain...

158
00:10:33,745 --> 00:10:36,111
...under the command
of an Italian navigator...

159
00:10:36,315 --> 00:10:38,408
...to discover the Americas.

160
00:10:39,284 --> 00:10:42,151
And then a Portuguese
expedition succeeded...

161
00:10:42,354 --> 00:10:45,983
...in sailing all the way
around this blue globe.

162
00:10:47,426 --> 00:10:50,020
These voyagers of many cultures...

163
00:10:50,229 --> 00:10:52,891
...were the first planetary explorers.

164
00:10:53,098 --> 00:10:56,192
They have bound the Earth up
into one world.

165
00:10:56,401 --> 00:10:58,460
In our exploration
of other worlds...

166
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:01,298
...we follow in their footsteps.

167
00:11:03,408 --> 00:11:06,468
Our present spaceships
are the harbingers...

168
00:11:06,678 --> 00:11:11,615
...the vanguard of future human
expeditions to the planets.

169
00:11:12,217 --> 00:11:15,186
We have traveled this way before...

170
00:11:15,387 --> 00:11:18,550
...and there is much to be learned...

171
00:11:18,757 --> 00:11:22,659
...by studying those great voyages of
a few centuries ago.

172
00:11:36,808 --> 00:11:38,366
In the 1 7th century...

173
00:11:38,577 --> 00:11:41,045
...the citizens of the new Dutch
Republic...

174
00:11:41,246 --> 00:11:45,808
...pursued a course of vigorous
planetary exploration.

175
00:11:47,486 --> 00:11:49,886
Holland was then
a revolutionary society.

176
00:11:50,088 --> 00:11:53,057
It had just declared its
independence from the powerful...

177
00:11:53,258 --> 00:11:55,249
...but stagnant Spanish empire...

178
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,655
...and with a newfound
self-confidence...

179
00:11:57,863 --> 00:12:00,798
...Holland embraced, more fully than
any other nation of its time...

180
00:12:00,999 --> 00:12:04,457
...the spirit of the European
Enlightenment.

181
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:12,837
It was a rational, orderly
and creative society.

182
00:12:13,045 --> 00:12:16,446
But because Spanish ports and vessels
were closed to the Dutch...

183
00:12:16,648 --> 00:12:18,809
...the economic survival
of the tiny republic...

184
00:12:19,017 --> 00:12:23,249
...depended on its ability to
construct, man and operate...

185
00:12:23,455 --> 00:12:26,185
...a great fleet of commercial
sailing vessels.

186
00:12:30,495 --> 00:12:32,326
The Dutch East India Company...

187
00:12:32,531 --> 00:12:35,625
...was a combined governmental
and commercial enterprise...

188
00:12:35,834 --> 00:12:38,462
...which sent shipping
to the far corners of the world...

189
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:43,164
...to acquire rare commodities and
resell them at a profit in Europe.

190
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:46,970
Such voyages were the life's blood
of the republic.

191
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:55,181
Navigational charts and maps
were classified as state secrets.

192
00:12:55,554 --> 00:12:58,682
Ships sometimes left
with sealed sailing orders...

193
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:01,882
...the crews embarking
for an unknown destination...

194
00:13:02,094 --> 00:13:05,894
...more than a year away
on the far side of the planet.

195
00:13:08,734 --> 00:13:11,999
These expeditions were not only
commercial exploitations...

196
00:13:12,204 --> 00:13:14,263
...although there was certainly
plenty of that.

197
00:13:14,473 --> 00:13:17,704
Beside the usual appeals
of ambition, greed...

198
00:13:17,909 --> 00:13:20,639
...national pride
and the thirst for adventure...

199
00:13:21,013 --> 00:13:24,847
...the Dutch were also motivated
by a powerful scientific curiosity...

200
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,678
...and a fascination with
all things new.

201
00:13:27,886 --> 00:13:30,821
New lands, new peoples...

202
00:13:31,023 --> 00:13:32,650
...new plants and animals.

203
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:41,731
This building,
then the Amsterdam town hall...

204
00:13:41,933 --> 00:13:45,061
...still attests
to the hardy self-assurance...

205
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,204
...of its 1 7th-century architects.

206
00:13:47,406 --> 00:13:50,864
Its lavish crystal adornments
still reflect...

207
00:13:51,076 --> 00:13:54,068
...the glittering pride they felt
in their accomplishments...

208
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:55,712
...and their prosperity.

209
00:13:55,914 --> 00:13:59,315
It took shiploads of marble
to build this place.

210
00:13:59,518 --> 00:14:03,614
Constantin Huygens, a poet
and diplomat of the time...

211
00:14:03,822 --> 00:14:07,280
...said that this town hall
dispelled what he called...

212
00:14:07,492 --> 00:14:10,859
..."the Gothic squint and squalor."

213
00:14:12,664 --> 00:14:17,499
The Middle Ages had ended,
the Enlightenment had begun.

214
00:14:21,073 --> 00:14:23,303
Up there, do you see...

215
00:14:23,508 --> 00:14:27,945
...is Atlas supporting the heavens
on his shoulders.

216
00:14:28,547 --> 00:14:30,174
And beneath...

217
00:14:31,616 --> 00:14:34,585
...is Justice with a golden sword...

218
00:14:34,786 --> 00:14:37,448
...and golden scales flanked...

219
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:41,450
...by Death and Punishment.

220
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:46,158
And who is it that Justice
is trampling underfoot?

221
00:14:46,365 --> 00:14:50,734
Why, it's Avarice and Envy...

222
00:14:50,936 --> 00:14:53,666
...the gods of the merchants.

223
00:14:53,872 --> 00:14:57,933
The Dutch knew that the unrestrained
pursuit of profit...

224
00:14:58,143 --> 00:15:01,874
...posed serious threats
to the soul of the nation.

225
00:15:03,081 --> 00:15:05,549
A less allegorical symbol...

226
00:15:05,751 --> 00:15:08,447
...is down here, on the floor.

227
00:15:11,757 --> 00:15:14,954
It is a great inlaid map...

228
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,859
...stretching from West Africa
to the Pacific Ocean.

229
00:15:20,065 --> 00:15:23,933
The whole world was then
Holland's arena.

230
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:28,337
In a typical year, many sailing
vessels...

231
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,839
...set out halfway around the world
for the Far East...

232
00:15:32,043 --> 00:15:36,104
...on voyages of exploration
and discovery, of trade...

233
00:15:36,314 --> 00:15:39,112
...journeys taking years
to accomplish.

234
00:15:39,317 --> 00:15:43,276
Down the west coast of Africa, through
what they called the Ethiopian sea...

235
00:15:43,488 --> 00:15:46,286
...skirting the southern coast
of Africa...

236
00:15:46,491 --> 00:15:49,221
...through the Straits
of Madagascar...

237
00:15:49,428 --> 00:15:53,228
...and on past the southern tip
of India...

238
00:15:53,432 --> 00:15:58,335
...to the Spice Islands
and present-day Indonesia.

239
00:16:03,442 --> 00:16:07,037
Another set of voyages went south
then east, to New Holland...

240
00:16:07,245 --> 00:16:09,770
...later renamed Australia.

241
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,381
And still other journeys ventured
through the Straits of Malacca...

242
00:16:19,858 --> 00:16:22,486
...to the Empire of China.

243
00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:28,998
But Holland was a small country
forced to live by its wits.

244
00:16:29,201 --> 00:16:31,897
There was a strong pacifist element
in its foreign policy.

245
00:16:32,704 --> 00:16:36,435
Never before or since
has Holland boasted such a galaxy...

246
00:16:36,641 --> 00:16:40,338
...of scientists, mathematicians,
philosophers and artists.

247
00:16:42,347 --> 00:16:45,783
This was the time of the great
painters, Rembrandt...

248
00:16:46,952 --> 00:16:48,647
...and Vermeer.

249
00:16:50,155 --> 00:16:54,922
Because Holland was tolerant
of unorthodox opinions...

250
00:16:55,126 --> 00:16:57,890
...it was a refuge
for intellectuals...

251
00:16:58,096 --> 00:17:02,430
...fleeing the thought control and
censorship of other parts of Europe...

252
00:17:02,767 --> 00:17:06,533
...much as the United States benefited
enormously in the 1 930s...

253
00:17:06,738 --> 00:17:09,400
...from the exodus of intellectuals...

254
00:17:09,608 --> 00:17:11,803
...from Nazi-dominated Europe.

255
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:14,604
And so it was that
17th-century Holland...

256
00:17:14,813 --> 00:17:18,374
...was the home of the great
Jewish philosopher Spinoza...

257
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:20,983
...who Einstein admired so much...

258
00:17:21,186 --> 00:17:24,019
...of Ren? Descartes,
a pivotal figure...

259
00:17:24,222 --> 00:17:27,282
...in the history of philosophy
and of mathematics...

260
00:17:27,492 --> 00:17:31,758
...and the home of a political
scientist named John Locke...

261
00:17:31,963 --> 00:17:35,194
...who was to have a powerful...

262
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,265
...and profound influence...

263
00:17:37,469 --> 00:17:41,565
...on a group of philosophically
inclined revolutionaries...

264
00:17:41,773 --> 00:17:45,573
...named Paine, Hamilton, Adams...

265
00:17:45,777 --> 00:17:47,938
...Franklin and Jefferson.

266
00:17:50,649 --> 00:17:53,117
The Dutch University of Leyden...

267
00:17:53,318 --> 00:17:58,119
...offered a professorship to an
Italian scientist named Galileo...

268
00:17:58,323 --> 00:18:01,156
...who had been forced
by the Catholic Church...

269
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:03,122
...under threat of torture...

270
00:18:03,328 --> 00:18:06,229
...to recant the heretical position...

271
00:18:06,431 --> 00:18:10,959
...that the Earth went around the sun
and not vice versa.

272
00:18:11,269 --> 00:18:13,703
Galileo had close ties
with Holland.

273
00:18:13,905 --> 00:18:15,736
His first astronomical telescope
was based...

274
00:18:15,941 --> 00:18:18,933
...on a spyglass
of Dutch manufacture.

275
00:18:19,144 --> 00:18:23,205
And with it, he discovered
the craters of the moon...

276
00:18:23,415 --> 00:18:28,114
...the phases of Venus and the
four large moons of Jupiter.

277
00:18:30,522 --> 00:18:32,649
Becoming an exploratory power...

278
00:18:32,857 --> 00:18:36,953
...made Holland a vital intellectual
and cultural center as well.

279
00:18:37,162 --> 00:18:41,724
The improvement of sailing technology
spurred technology in general.

280
00:18:42,334 --> 00:18:46,361
A key problem in navigation was
the determination of longitude.

281
00:18:46,571 --> 00:18:48,539
Latitude could be determined
easily...

282
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,709
...the farther south, the more
southern constellations you could see.

283
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:56,303
But longitude required precise
timekeeping.

284
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,717
An accurate shipboard clock...

285
00:18:59,918 --> 00:19:02,478
...would continue to keep time
in your home port.

286
00:19:02,687 --> 00:19:05,815
The rising and setting of stars
would give you the local time...

287
00:19:06,024 --> 00:19:08,515
...and the difference
between the two...

288
00:19:08,727 --> 00:19:11,218
...would tell you how far
east or west you had gone.

289
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:17,227
Technological advance
required the freest...

290
00:19:17,435 --> 00:19:18,925
...possible pursuit of knowledge.

291
00:19:19,337 --> 00:19:23,273
So Holland became the leading
publisher and bookseller in Europe...

292
00:19:23,475 --> 00:19:25,534
...translating works written
in other languages...

293
00:19:25,744 --> 00:19:28,941
...and printing books
that had been censored elsewhere.

294
00:19:30,615 --> 00:19:33,140
Adventures into exotic lands...

295
00:19:33,351 --> 00:19:35,785
...and encounters
with strange societies...

296
00:19:35,987 --> 00:19:37,545
...shook complacency.

297
00:19:39,724 --> 00:19:41,954
They challenged
the prevailing wisdom...

298
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,561
...and showed that ideas accepted
for thousands of years...

299
00:19:45,764 --> 00:19:47,959
...might be fundamentally in error.

300
00:20:00,278 --> 00:20:04,271
In a time when kings and emperors
ruled much of the planet...

301
00:20:04,482 --> 00:20:07,940
...the Dutch Republic was governed,
more than any other world power...

302
00:20:08,153 --> 00:20:09,552
...by the people.

303
00:20:15,794 --> 00:20:19,321
They enjoyed a certain
material well-being.

304
00:20:19,531 --> 00:20:21,624
But the interiors of their houses...

305
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:24,563
...celebrated by a generation
of Dutch painters...

306
00:20:24,769 --> 00:20:28,796
...suggest restraint and discretion.

307
00:20:35,447 --> 00:20:38,814
The officers of these ships
of exploration and trade...

308
00:20:39,017 --> 00:20:41,315
...would return from their long
voyages...

309
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:43,817
...share in the goods
they had acquired...

310
00:20:44,255 --> 00:20:48,419
...and discuss the wonders
they had encountered.

311
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:58,625
Holland prospered
in its freedom of thought.

312
00:21:11,783 --> 00:21:15,241
In Italy, Galileo
had announced other worlds.

313
00:21:15,453 --> 00:21:19,412
Giordano Bruno had speculated
on intelligent life elsewhere.

314
00:21:19,624 --> 00:21:23,116
For this they were
made to suffer brutally.

315
00:21:24,729 --> 00:21:27,789
But in Holland, the astronomer
Christiaan Huygens...

316
00:21:27,999 --> 00:21:32,527
...who strongly supported both ideas,
was showered with honors.

317
00:21:34,773 --> 00:21:38,573
Christiaan was the son
of Constantin Huygens.

318
00:21:40,044 --> 00:21:42,535
The elder Huygens
distinguished himself...

319
00:21:42,747 --> 00:21:46,046
...as a master diplomat of the age,
a man of letters...

320
00:21:46,251 --> 00:21:50,312
...a close friend and translator
of the English poet, John Donne.

321
00:21:52,724 --> 00:21:57,661
Constantin was also an accomplished
composer and musician.

322
00:22:10,441 --> 00:22:12,875
It was Constantin who had discovered
a young painter...

323
00:22:13,077 --> 00:22:15,068
...named Rembrandt van Rijn...

324
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,613
...in several of whose works
he subsequently appears.

325
00:22:19,684 --> 00:22:21,584
He opened the doors of his house...

326
00:22:21,786 --> 00:22:23,651
...to artists, musicians, writers...

327
00:22:23,855 --> 00:22:26,255
...statesmen and scientists.

328
00:22:27,025 --> 00:22:29,050
A feast of goods and ideas...

329
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,093
...from all over the world
awaited them.

330
00:22:34,465 --> 00:22:37,263
The philosopher Descartes,
who visited him here...

331
00:22:37,468 --> 00:22:39,163
...said of Constantin Huygens...

332
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:42,032
..."I could not believe
that a single mind...

333
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,970
...could occupy itself
with so many things...

334
00:22:45,176 --> 00:22:48,475
...and acquit itself so well
in all of them."

335
00:22:49,514 --> 00:22:51,948
He even excelled
at the art of parenthood.

336
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:54,414
He was a tender and loving father.

337
00:22:54,619 --> 00:22:58,111
His son, Christiaan, flourished
in this rich environment...

338
00:22:58,323 --> 00:23:01,724
...demonstrating extraordinary talents
for languages, drawing...

339
00:23:01,926 --> 00:23:05,726
...law, science, engineering
mathematics and music.

340
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,528
"The world is my country," he said...

341
00:23:12,737 --> 00:23:15,763
..."science my religion."

342
00:23:20,879 --> 00:23:24,110
Light was the motif of the age...

343
00:23:24,315 --> 00:23:28,479
...the symbolic enlightenment of
freedom of thought and religion...

344
00:23:28,686 --> 00:23:31,951
...the light that suffused
the paintings of the time...

345
00:23:32,156 --> 00:23:35,421
...and light as an object
of scientific study.

346
00:23:35,727 --> 00:23:38,662
The microscope was invented in Holland
at this time...

347
00:23:38,863 --> 00:23:42,697
...and became
a drawing-room curiosity.

348
00:23:43,701 --> 00:23:45,896
Its inventor was a friend
of Christiaan Huygens...

349
00:23:46,104 --> 00:23:48,197
...a man named Anton Leeuwenhoek.

350
00:23:57,782 --> 00:24:00,512
The first microscopes
were developed from...

351
00:24:00,718 --> 00:24:02,845
...magnifying glasses
used by drapers...

352
00:24:03,054 --> 00:24:06,285
...to examine the quality of cloth.

353
00:24:12,931 --> 00:24:14,421
Leeuwenhoek and Huygens...

354
00:24:14,632 --> 00:24:17,362
...are the grandfathers of much of
modern medicine.

355
00:24:18,836 --> 00:24:21,828
Because, to his amazement...

356
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,668
...Leeuwenhoek discovered a
universe...

357
00:24:24,876 --> 00:24:26,366
...in a drop of water:

358
00:24:26,577 --> 00:24:30,445
The microbes, which he described
as "animalcules"...

359
00:24:30,648 --> 00:24:33,208
...and thought "cute."

360
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:43,054
Leeuwenhoek and Huygens...

361
00:24:43,261 --> 00:24:46,025
...were among the first people to see
human sperm cells...

362
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:50,132
...a hitherto hidden microcosm
of the human life cycle.

363
00:24:51,202 --> 00:24:54,330
Leeuwenhoek had discovered
the microbial world.

364
00:24:54,906 --> 00:24:58,364
Huygens had argued
from his telescopic observations...

365
00:24:58,576 --> 00:25:00,601
...that Mars was another world...

366
00:25:00,812 --> 00:25:03,804
...and probably, an inhabited one.

367
00:25:10,054 --> 00:25:12,545
What a waste of a planet,
he thought...

368
00:25:12,757 --> 00:25:15,191
...if Mars were barren.

369
00:25:17,929 --> 00:25:21,296
So the Viking search
for microbes on Mars...

370
00:25:21,499 --> 00:25:25,458
...can be traced directly back
to Huygens and Leeuwenhoek...

371
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:28,138
...in 1 7th-century Holland.

372
00:25:32,677 --> 00:25:36,135
The telescope and the microscope
developed here...

373
00:25:36,347 --> 00:25:39,111
...represent an extension
of human vision...

374
00:25:39,317 --> 00:25:41,717
...to the realms of the very small...

375
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,944
...and the very large.

376
00:25:47,191 --> 00:25:51,025
Our observations of atoms
and galaxies...

377
00:25:51,229 --> 00:25:54,130
...were launched
in this time and place.

378
00:25:57,769 --> 00:26:00,237
From the bending of light
through a lens...

379
00:26:00,438 --> 00:26:02,235
...Huygens advanced the idea...

380
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,931
...that light was a kind of wave.

381
00:26:05,143 --> 00:26:07,111
He ground and polished lenses...

382
00:26:07,311 --> 00:26:10,712
...for the successively larger
telescopes he constructed...

383
00:26:10,915 --> 00:26:14,248
...although it did take him
a time to figure out...

384
00:26:14,452 --> 00:26:16,443
...how to use them properly.

385
00:26:25,863 --> 00:26:28,354
Huygens was the first person
to see a surface feature...

386
00:26:28,566 --> 00:26:30,124
...on the planet Mars.

387
00:26:30,601 --> 00:26:32,364
He was the first person
to speculate...

388
00:26:33,071 --> 00:26:35,369
...that Venus is completely
covered with clouds.

389
00:26:36,174 --> 00:26:40,076
He was the first person to understand
the nature of the rings of Saturn.

390
00:26:40,278 --> 00:26:42,371
"Saturn is surrounded," he wrote...

391
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,207
..."by a thin, flat ring...

392
00:26:44,415 --> 00:26:47,907
...which nowhere touches
the body of the planet."

393
00:26:59,197 --> 00:27:01,028
His discoveries with the telescope...

394
00:27:01,232 --> 00:27:03,996
...who by themselves
have ensured his place...

395
00:27:04,202 --> 00:27:06,796
...in the history
of human accomplishment.

396
00:27:15,513 --> 00:27:19,108
Huygens was the discoverer of Titan...

397
00:27:19,317 --> 00:27:21,581
...the largest moon of Saturn.

398
00:27:28,526 --> 00:27:32,587
The immense size and changing clouds
of Jupiter entranced him.

399
00:27:35,967 --> 00:27:38,231
Astronomers, as well as navigators...

400
00:27:38,436 --> 00:27:42,338
...need accurate clocks to time
the movement of the heavens.

401
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:45,907
Huygens was the inventor
of many precision timepieces...

402
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:48,510
...including the pendulum clock.

403
00:27:56,654 --> 00:28:00,750
To illustrate the sun-centered
universe of Copernicus...

404
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:04,587
...he built computers that reproduced
the clockwork of the heavens...

405
00:28:05,363 --> 00:28:07,524
...from Mercury to Saturn.

406
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:15,532
The machines he designed, he signed...

407
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:18,732
..."Christiaan Huygens, inventor."

408
00:28:21,345 --> 00:28:23,313
He was delighted that
the Copernican system...

409
00:28:23,514 --> 00:28:26,005
...was widely accepted
in everyday life in Holland...

410
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:30,118
...and acknowledged by astronomers,
except those, he wrote...

411
00:28:30,321 --> 00:28:33,119
...who "were a bit slow-witted or
under the superstitions...

412
00:28:33,324 --> 00:28:37,021
...imposed by merely human authority.

413
00:28:39,597 --> 00:28:43,624
Across the sea of space...

414
00:28:44,068 --> 00:28:46,059
...the stars...

415
00:28:46,671 --> 00:28:48,605
...are other suns."

416
00:28:48,806 --> 00:28:52,367
A point which Huygens appreciated
perfectly well.

417
00:28:53,344 --> 00:28:58,281
He reasoned that if
our planetary system...

418
00:28:58,583 --> 00:29:01,780
...involved the sun
and planets going around it...

419
00:29:01,986 --> 00:29:05,444
...that those other suns should
likewise have a retinue...

420
00:29:05,656 --> 00:29:07,385
...of planets going around them...

421
00:29:07,592 --> 00:29:11,528
...and also that many of the other
planets were inhabited.

422
00:29:11,796 --> 00:29:13,764
He set forth these conclusions...

423
00:29:13,965 --> 00:29:16,957
...in a remarkable book...

424
00:29:17,168 --> 00:29:19,830
...bearing the triumphant title...

425
00:29:20,037 --> 00:29:23,473
...The Celestial Worlds Discovered.

426
00:29:23,674 --> 00:29:25,141
The subtitle is...

427
00:29:25,343 --> 00:29:27,402
..."Conjectures Concerning...

428
00:29:27,612 --> 00:29:32,447
...the Inhabitants, Plants
and Productions...

429
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:35,915
...of the Worlds in the Planets."

430
00:29:36,921 --> 00:29:40,755
He wrote this book sometime shortly
before his death...

431
00:29:40,958 --> 00:29:44,724
...in the year 1 690, in this study.

432
00:29:51,836 --> 00:29:52,996
By and large...

433
00:29:53,571 --> 00:29:56,631
...he imagined that the environments
of the other planets...

434
00:29:56,841 --> 00:29:59,639
...and also the inhabitants
of the other planets...

435
00:29:59,844 --> 00:30:04,304
...were pretty much like those
of 17th-century Europe.

436
00:30:04,715 --> 00:30:06,910
I wonder if he imagined...

437
00:30:07,118 --> 00:30:09,848
...traveling to those other worlds
which he had been...

438
00:30:10,054 --> 00:30:12,352
...the first to examine close-up...

439
00:30:12,556 --> 00:30:14,490
...through the telescope.

440
00:30:15,126 --> 00:30:18,892
Perhaps he dreamt that voyages
of discovery to the planets...

441
00:30:19,096 --> 00:30:22,793
...would one day be like the
voyages of geographical discovery...

442
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,434
...in his time and place.

443
00:30:27,905 --> 00:30:31,033
He did imagine of
extraterrestrial beings...

444
00:30:32,243 --> 00:30:35,144
..."that their whole bodies,
and every part of them...

445
00:30:35,346 --> 00:30:38,907
...may be quite distinct
and different from ours.

446
00:30:39,116 --> 00:30:42,108
'Its a very ridiculous opinion,"
he says...

447
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,447
..."that it is impossible
a rational soul...

448
00:30:44,655 --> 00:30:48,113
...should dwell in any other shape
than ours."

449
00:30:48,859 --> 00:30:51,157
You could be smart,
Huygens was saying...

450
00:30:51,362 --> 00:30:53,091
...even if you looked funny.

451
00:30:53,397 --> 00:30:55,262
But he then went on to argue...

452
00:30:55,466 --> 00:30:57,832
...that they didn't look
all that funny...

453
00:30:58,035 --> 00:31:00,503
...that extraterrestrial beings
must have...

454
00:31:00,705 --> 00:31:03,105
...hands and feet and stand upright...

455
00:31:03,307 --> 00:31:05,172
...and have writing and geometry.

456
00:31:05,376 --> 00:31:07,844
Even that the four
moons of Jupiter...

457
00:31:08,045 --> 00:31:12,175
...the Galilean satellites,
were there in order to provide...

458
00:31:12,383 --> 00:31:15,045
...a navigational aid,
a convenience...

459
00:31:15,252 --> 00:31:17,812
...for the sailors
in the Jovian oceans.

460
00:31:18,155 --> 00:31:20,749
Well, maybe.

461
00:31:20,958 --> 00:31:22,892
(WOOD CREAKS)

462
00:31:27,832 --> 00:31:31,962
That bit of speculation
is probably wrong, but...

463
00:31:32,169 --> 00:31:34,603
...think of a citizen
of the 1 7th century...

464
00:31:34,805 --> 00:31:37,273
...with the courage and insight...

465
00:31:37,475 --> 00:31:41,138
...to imagine other landscapes
and other intelligences.

466
00:31:41,345 --> 00:31:44,075
Might there really be mariners...

467
00:31:44,281 --> 00:31:46,442
...on a million other worlds?

468
00:31:49,487 --> 00:31:51,387
In his book, Huygens wrote:

469
00:31:51,589 --> 00:31:55,548
"What a wonderful and amazing scheme
have we here...

470
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,059
...of the magnificent vastness
of the universe.

471
00:31:59,263 --> 00:32:02,926
So many suns. So many earths.

472
00:32:03,134 --> 00:32:07,332
And every one of them
stocked with so many animals.

473
00:32:07,605 --> 00:32:10,005
Adorned with so many seas.

474
00:32:10,207 --> 00:32:12,801
How must our wonder and admiration
be increased...

475
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:17,610
...when we consider the prodigious
distance and multitude...

476
00:32:17,815 --> 00:32:19,112
...of the stars?"

477
00:32:25,956 --> 00:32:29,722
The Dutch called their ships
"flying boats"...

478
00:32:29,927 --> 00:32:32,828
...and the Voyager spacecraft
are their descendants...

479
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:35,328
...true flying boats...

480
00:32:35,533 --> 00:32:38,263
...bound for the stars,
and on the way...

481
00:32:38,469 --> 00:32:41,768
...exploring some of those worlds
which Christiaan Huygens...

482
00:32:41,972 --> 00:32:43,405
...a man from Earth...

483
00:32:43,607 --> 00:32:46,474
...knew and loved so well.

484
00:32:48,345 --> 00:32:50,210
Travelers' tales:

485
00:32:50,414 --> 00:32:51,813
A main commodity...

486
00:32:52,016 --> 00:32:56,214
...returned by those sailing ship
voyages of centuries ago...

487
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,820
...were stories.

488
00:32:59,156 --> 00:33:03,490
Stories of alien lands
and exotic creatures.

489
00:33:06,931 --> 00:33:10,594
They evoked a sense of wonder
and stimulated further exploration.

490
00:33:10,801 --> 00:33:13,395
Those tales of strange worlds...

491
00:33:13,604 --> 00:33:16,835
...enabled some Europeans
to see themselves anew.

492
00:33:17,274 --> 00:33:20,710
There had been accounts
of headless people, foot people...

493
00:33:20,911 --> 00:33:22,344
...cyclops people.

494
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,281
Now the Dutch brought back
fantastic stories...

495
00:33:26,517 --> 00:33:28,280
...of giant hunters...

496
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,847
...dodoes...

497
00:33:31,355 --> 00:33:33,414
...rhinos...

498
00:33:33,924 --> 00:33:35,448
...leopards...

499
00:33:35,659 --> 00:33:38,924
...and other creatures.

500
00:33:41,732 --> 00:33:46,328
Modern voyagers
also return travelers' tales:

501
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:51,607
Tales of a world shattered
like a crystal sphere.

502
00:33:52,376 --> 00:33:54,867
A place where the ground is covered...

503
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:59,641
...with what looks like
a network of giant cobwebs.

504
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:06,080
A world with an underground ocean.

505
00:34:07,424 --> 00:34:10,359
Tiny moons shaped like potatoes.

506
00:34:11,762 --> 00:34:14,458
A yellow and red pockmarked land...

507
00:34:14,665 --> 00:34:16,496
...with lakes of molten sulfur...

508
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:20,693
...and volcanic eruptions
300 kilometers high.

509
00:34:24,475 --> 00:34:26,102
And a place called Jupiter...

510
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:29,643
...so large that a thousand Earths
would fit inside.

511
00:34:29,847 --> 00:34:33,078
There are no mountains, valleys,
volcanoes or rivers there.

512
00:34:33,284 --> 00:34:36,014
Just a vast ocean of gas and clouds.

513
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:39,883
Everything we see on Jupiter
is floating in the sky.

514
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,293
But there's much that is fascinating
about Jupiter.

515
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:50,066
As the solar system condensed
out of interstellar gas and dust...

516
00:34:50,267 --> 00:34:54,704
...Jupiter acquired most of the matter
not ejected into interstellar space...

517
00:34:54,905 --> 00:34:58,204
...and which didn't fall inwards
to form the sun.

518
00:34:58,409 --> 00:35:03,312
Jupiter is made mostly of hydrogen
and helium, just like the sun...

519
00:35:03,514 --> 00:35:08,110
...and had Jupiter been a few dozen
times more massive...

520
00:35:08,319 --> 00:35:09,786
...the matter in it...

521
00:35:09,987 --> 00:35:14,424
...might have undergone thermonuclear
reactions in the interior...

522
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:18,857
...and Jupiter would have begun
to shine by its own light.

523
00:35:19,063 --> 00:35:23,056
Jupiter is a star that failed.

524
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,799
Had it become a star...

525
00:35:25,002 --> 00:35:27,562
...we would be living
in a double-star system...

526
00:35:27,771 --> 00:35:29,864
...with two suns in our sky...

527
00:35:30,074 --> 00:35:33,737
...and the nights
would come more rarely.

528
00:35:33,944 --> 00:35:38,040
Deep below the clouds of Jupiter, the
weights of the layers of atmosphere...

529
00:35:38,248 --> 00:35:41,115
...produce pressures
which are much greater...

530
00:35:41,318 --> 00:35:44,116
...than any that are found
anywhere on the Earth.

531
00:35:44,355 --> 00:35:46,255
The clouds are this layer here.

532
00:35:46,457 --> 00:35:49,517
The deep interior
is this high-pressure place.

533
00:35:49,727 --> 00:35:51,354
The pressure is so large...

534
00:35:51,562 --> 00:35:56,090
...that electrons are squeezed off
hydrogen atoms, producing...

535
00:35:57,101 --> 00:36:01,162
...liquid metallic hydrogen.

536
00:36:01,472 --> 00:36:06,171
But at the very core of Jupiter,
there may be a lump...

537
00:36:06,377 --> 00:36:07,435
...of rock and iron...

538
00:36:07,645 --> 00:36:12,082
...a giant Earth-like world
under astonishing pressures...

539
00:36:12,282 --> 00:36:16,912
...hidden forever at the center
of the largest planet.

540
00:36:19,223 --> 00:36:20,690
Just before Voyager...

541
00:36:20,891 --> 00:36:25,658
...encountered Jupiter, you could see
that giant planet at night...

542
00:36:25,863 --> 00:36:30,800
...shining in the sky as our ancestors
have for the last million years.

543
00:36:31,101 --> 00:36:33,831
And on my way to study
the Voyager data...

544
00:36:34,038 --> 00:36:36,506
...arriving at the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory...

545
00:36:36,707 --> 00:36:39,801
...I thought that Jupiter
would never be the same again.

546
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:43,969
Never again just a point of light
in the night sky...

547
00:36:44,181 --> 00:36:48,515
...but forever after, a place
to be explored and known.

548
00:36:51,655 --> 00:36:56,183
To see the first close-up images
of a world never before known...

549
00:36:56,393 --> 00:37:00,591
...is a great joy in the life
of a planetary scientist.

550
00:37:02,833 --> 00:37:07,236
In the early morning hours of
July 9th, 1979, on the real-time...

551
00:37:07,438 --> 00:37:10,407
...television monitors at the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory...

552
00:37:10,607 --> 00:37:13,735
...we began to learn
about a world called Europa.

553
00:37:13,977 --> 00:37:16,036
These are the modern explorers.

554
00:37:16,246 --> 00:37:17,975
Men and women trained...

555
00:37:18,182 --> 00:37:21,117
...in astronomy, physics,
geology or engineering.

556
00:37:21,318 --> 00:37:24,287
Many devoting five to eight years
to this single mission.

557
00:37:24,488 --> 00:37:28,049
JPL MAN: Cassen's model for Europa
says if you start with a liquid...

558
00:37:28,258 --> 00:37:31,022
...you can put in enough energy
to keep it liquid.

559
00:37:32,429 --> 00:37:36,490
But Cassen said in order for there
to be enough heating going on...

560
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:40,932
...you had to start the heating
before Europa basically cooled off.

561
00:37:42,339 --> 00:37:44,671
But what about relief
from the cracks?

562
00:37:47,845 --> 00:37:51,679
...and Europa there's a twin,
a pair there...

563
00:37:52,683 --> 00:37:56,016
You can't look at a world
so different from ours...

564
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,279
...without wondering
how both were made.

565
00:37:58,489 --> 00:38:00,514
Just rotate it out a little bit.

566
00:38:01,959 --> 00:38:05,827
Voyager presented us with six new
worlds in the Jupiter system alone.

567
00:38:06,797 --> 00:38:10,858
The more you learn about other worlds,
the better you understand our own.

568
00:38:11,068 --> 00:38:16,005
We speculate, criticize, argue,
calculate, reflect and wonder.

569
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:20,106
We return again to the astonishing
data, and slowly...

570
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:22,676
...we begin to understand.

571
00:38:33,757 --> 00:38:37,124
The Dutch sailing ships brought back
rare and valuable commodities...

572
00:38:37,327 --> 00:38:39,318
...from the new worlds they visited.

573
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:41,464
Our Voyager spaceships...

574
00:38:41,665 --> 00:38:44,327
...return rare and valuable
information...

575
00:38:44,535 --> 00:38:48,266
...to computerized wharves on this
shore of the sea of space.

576
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:53,942
Here the data are stored,
enhanced, processed and treasured.

577
00:38:54,645 --> 00:38:58,240
Maps of alien lands will be generated
from this information.

578
00:38:58,448 --> 00:39:02,544
In this electric warehouse
are tens of thousands of images...

579
00:39:02,753 --> 00:39:05,586
...of previously unknown worlds.

580
00:39:07,758 --> 00:39:11,159
How does a picture from
the outer solar system get to us?

581
00:39:11,361 --> 00:39:14,728
Sunlight shines on Europa,
and is reflected back to space...

582
00:39:14,932 --> 00:39:16,763
...where some strikes the phosphors...

583
00:39:16,967 --> 00:39:20,232
...of the Voyager television cameras,
generating an image.

584
00:39:20,437 --> 00:39:23,668
The image is radioed back
across the immense distance...

585
00:39:23,874 --> 00:39:26,035
...of half a billion kilometers...

586
00:39:26,243 --> 00:39:29,440
...to a radio telescope on Earth.
One in Australia, say.

587
00:39:29,646 --> 00:39:32,410
The telescope then passes
the information...

588
00:39:32,616 --> 00:39:35,608
...via communications satellite
in Earth orbit...

589
00:39:35,819 --> 00:39:37,514
...to Southern California.

590
00:39:37,721 --> 00:39:41,680
There, it's transmitted
by a set of microwave relay towers...

591
00:39:41,892 --> 00:39:45,259
...to a computer
at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory...

592
00:39:46,096 --> 00:39:48,997
...and there it is processed.

593
00:39:56,273 --> 00:39:58,867
The picture is like
a newspaper wire photo...

594
00:39:59,076 --> 00:40:02,978
...made of a million individual dots
of differing shades of gray...

595
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,910
...so fine and close together
that at a distance...

596
00:40:06,116 --> 00:40:08,949
...the constituent dots
are invisible.

597
00:40:09,152 --> 00:40:11,780
We see only
their cumulative effect.

598
00:40:13,023 --> 00:40:16,083
The information specifies
how bright or dark...

599
00:40:16,293 --> 00:40:17,920
...each dot is to be.

600
00:40:18,128 --> 00:40:21,188
After processing, the dots
are stored on a magnetic disk...

601
00:40:21,398 --> 00:40:23,832
...something like a phonograph record.

602
00:40:24,067 --> 00:40:27,901
By this day, there were already 1 1,000
pictures from Voyager 2 in our...

603
00:40:28,105 --> 00:40:29,766
...electronic library.

604
00:40:30,774 --> 00:40:34,505
Finally, the end product
of this remarkable set...

605
00:40:34,711 --> 00:40:36,941
...of links and relays...

606
00:40:38,048 --> 00:40:41,643
...is a hard copy which comes
out of this machine showing...

607
00:40:42,052 --> 00:40:44,987
...in this case,
the wonders of Europa...

608
00:40:45,188 --> 00:40:49,420
...which were recorded for the first
time in human history, today.

609
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,986
It is absolutely astonishing.

610
00:40:53,964 --> 00:40:58,526
Voyager 1 got very good pictures
of the other three big moons...

611
00:40:58,735 --> 00:41:02,102
...Galilean satellites of Jupiter,
but not of Europa.

612
00:41:02,306 --> 00:41:05,241
It was left to Voyager 2 today...

613
00:41:05,442 --> 00:41:08,536
...to get the first
close-up pictures of Europa...

614
00:41:08,745 --> 00:41:12,272
...where we see things that are only
a few kilometers across.

615
00:41:12,482 --> 00:41:15,645
At first glance, it looks like
nothing so much as...

616
00:41:15,852 --> 00:41:20,789
...the canal network of Mars that
Lowell imagined existed on that planet.

617
00:41:21,258 --> 00:41:26,195
We see an amazing, intricate network
of crisscrossing...

618
00:41:26,463 --> 00:41:28,761
...straight and curved lines.

619
00:41:28,966 --> 00:41:31,025
Are these straight lines ridges?

620
00:41:31,234 --> 00:41:32,326
Are they troughs?

621
00:41:32,536 --> 00:41:35,562
Is it connected with plate tectonics
on the Earth?

622
00:41:35,772 --> 00:41:40,072
How does it illuminate the other
satellites of the Jovian system?

623
00:41:40,377 --> 00:41:43,676
At this moment,
the vaunted technology...

624
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,178
...has produced something
astonishing.

625
00:41:46,383 --> 00:41:48,681
But it remains for...

626
00:41:49,186 --> 00:41:53,555
...the limitations and cleverness
of another device...

627
00:41:53,757 --> 00:41:56,692
...the human brain, to figure it out.

628
00:41:58,862 --> 00:42:02,923
Fortunately, we have plenty
of pictures to help us.

629
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:07,927
What about Gene's idea of geysers
down the troughs?

630
00:42:08,138 --> 00:42:10,265
Geysers down the troughs?

631
00:42:11,475 --> 00:42:13,534
LARR Y SODERBLOM:
You need a mechanism to drive it.

632
00:42:13,744 --> 00:42:17,043
SAGAN:
Larry Soderblom, Voyager imaging team.

633
00:42:17,247 --> 00:42:22,150
LARR Y: An idea was proposed a while
ago that we might have a sort of...

634
00:42:22,352 --> 00:42:24,547
...champagne-bottle model.
And that's...

635
00:42:24,755 --> 00:42:28,088
You seal the crust and have liquid
underneath that solid crust.

636
00:42:28,592 --> 00:42:32,028
Do you have then a condition which
is an explosive effervescence?

637
00:42:32,362 --> 00:42:34,523
SAGAN:
Lonnie Lane, deputy project scientist.

638
00:42:35,799 --> 00:42:39,530
You have enough resolution
in some of these pictures that...

639
00:42:39,736 --> 00:42:42,170
...you don't see anything
spread laterally.

640
00:42:42,372 --> 00:42:45,000
Do we have the high-resolution piece?

641
00:42:45,275 --> 00:42:47,869
-It was right here.
-There it is.

642
00:42:48,078 --> 00:42:51,013
We'll pick out the relief,
and if we're going to see...

643
00:42:51,214 --> 00:42:52,511
...the things we recognize...

644
00:42:52,716 --> 00:42:55,412
SAGAN: Weeks after the pictures
from Europa were received...

645
00:42:55,619 --> 00:42:57,712
...we were still debating
what was in them.

646
00:42:57,921 --> 00:43:00,890
It's as if we almost got to the...

647
00:43:01,725 --> 00:43:03,158
Look at the mesas here.

648
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,923
We almost got the resolution
needed to see the craters.

649
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:10,566
The craters which would last
indefinitely on a crust this thin.

650
00:43:10,767 --> 00:43:12,291
Apart from the r?seaus...

651
00:43:12,502 --> 00:43:17,337
...there's a set of very fine
small dots, markings...

652
00:43:17,541 --> 00:43:19,736
...mostly in the mottled terrain.

653
00:43:19,943 --> 00:43:23,538
Like those guys. Do you think
those are...

654
00:43:23,747 --> 00:43:27,205
...sites of outgassing, calderas,
fumaroles, solfataras?

655
00:43:27,417 --> 00:43:30,545
I don't know, but I'll tell you
one thing I just found...

656
00:43:32,789 --> 00:43:34,188
Look right here.

657
00:43:35,759 --> 00:43:37,124
It disappeared.

658
00:43:38,228 --> 00:43:40,389
See the central peak?

659
00:43:40,597 --> 00:43:42,497
See the little hole?

660
00:43:45,168 --> 00:43:47,636
I think it's an impact crater.
Look at the central peak.

661
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:49,931
SAGAN:
There are almost no impact craters.

662
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:51,767
Wait, we just found one.

663
00:43:51,975 --> 00:43:53,203
Almost none.

664
00:43:54,311 --> 00:43:58,441
Therefore, finding one which is
alleged to be the exception...

665
00:43:58,648 --> 00:44:01,640
...maybe it's not the exception,
but something else.

666
00:44:01,852 --> 00:44:06,016
Perhaps, but you asked about those
little holes that we can't make out.

667
00:44:08,158 --> 00:44:11,525
The big craters go away by some
rheological deformation...

668
00:44:11,728 --> 00:44:14,561
...and the little ones stay
but are out of our resolution.

669
00:44:14,764 --> 00:44:18,666
That's because they're one-tenth
the depth of the rigid crust.

670
00:44:18,869 --> 00:44:20,063
Well, maybe.

671
00:44:21,304 --> 00:44:24,000
SAGAN: Computer processing of
the pictures has revealed...

672
00:44:24,207 --> 00:44:27,438
...a few features on Europa
which seem to be impact craters.

673
00:44:27,644 --> 00:44:28,702
But something...

674
00:44:28,912 --> 00:44:31,210
...has wiped out the big craters.

675
00:44:31,414 --> 00:44:33,746
Computer processing
also played a major role...

676
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:37,977
...in an amazing Voyager discovery
made on the moon next to Europa...

677
00:44:38,188 --> 00:44:40,952
...a world called lo.

678
00:44:42,492 --> 00:44:45,791
Even from Earth we could tell
that lo had a strange color.

679
00:44:45,996 --> 00:44:49,363
We knew that somehow sulfur
had been removed from its surface...

680
00:44:49,566 --> 00:44:53,229
...and ejected into a great
doughnut of gas orbiting Jupiter.

681
00:44:53,436 --> 00:44:57,304
Then Voyager 1 sailed close to lo.

682
00:44:59,709 --> 00:45:03,941
There were a few places on lo which
looked like the mouths of volcanoes...

683
00:45:04,147 --> 00:45:05,842
...but it was hard to be sure.

684
00:45:06,716 --> 00:45:10,208
Then, Linda Morabito, a member
of the Voyager navigation team...

685
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:13,287
...used a computer
to enhance the edge of lo...

686
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:16,015
...in order to bring out
the stars behind.

687
00:45:16,226 --> 00:45:20,128
Four days after the Voyager 1
encounter with Jupiter...

688
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:24,130
...I was looking at an
optical navigation frame.

689
00:45:24,334 --> 00:45:28,464
In enhancing this particular quadrant,
what became very evident to me...

690
00:45:28,672 --> 00:45:30,731
...was an anomalous crescent...

691
00:45:30,941 --> 00:45:34,308
...in the upper left-hand corner,
just off the limb of lo.

692
00:45:34,511 --> 00:45:35,705
SAGAN:
What was it?

693
00:45:35,912 --> 00:45:38,312
The plume was in exactly
the position...

694
00:45:38,515 --> 00:45:40,540
...of one of the suspected volcanoes.

695
00:45:40,951 --> 00:45:44,352
We realized then that
what we were observing...

696
00:45:44,554 --> 00:45:48,615
...was a volcanic plume and,
in fact, a volcanic eruption.

697
00:45:50,694 --> 00:45:55,393
SAGAN: Voyager had discovered the
first active volcano beyond the Earth.

698
00:45:57,767 --> 00:46:00,201
We then found that lo
has many volcanoes.

699
00:46:00,403 --> 00:46:03,497
There are at least nine
intermittently active plumes...

700
00:46:03,707 --> 00:46:06,335
...and hundreds, maybe thousands,
of extinct ones.

701
00:46:06,543 --> 00:46:10,536
The plumes can eject sulfur
and other atoms off lo altogether...

702
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,441
...and account for the sulfur clouds
surrounding Jupiter.

703
00:46:15,185 --> 00:46:19,952
Rivers of molten sulfur flow down
the sides of the volcanic mountains...

704
00:46:20,156 --> 00:46:23,216
...and are the probable source
of Io's distinctive colors.

705
00:46:23,426 --> 00:46:28,159
The volcanoes may be tapping some vast
underground ocean of liquid sulfur...

706
00:46:28,365 --> 00:46:32,734
...beneath a surface
that is only a few thousand years old.

707
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,098
So far, in our voyages
to the outer solar system...

708
00:46:40,343 --> 00:46:42,811
...we humans have stayed home...

709
00:46:43,013 --> 00:46:46,244
...and sent robots and computers
to explore in our stead.

710
00:46:46,449 --> 00:46:49,509
Someday, perhaps, we'll go ourselves.

711
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:51,814
But suppose...

712
00:46:52,422 --> 00:46:55,357
...like those Dutch sea captains
of the 1 7th century...

713
00:46:55,558 --> 00:46:58,994
...the computers aboard Voyager
could keep a ship's log.

714
00:46:59,195 --> 00:47:03,291
That log, a combination of the events
of Voyagers 1 and 2...

715
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:06,367
...might read something like this:

716
00:47:08,805 --> 00:47:13,504
Day 1: After much concern
about provisions and instruments...

717
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:17,942
...we successfully lift off from
Cape Canaveral on our long journey...

718
00:47:18,148 --> 00:47:20,742
...to the planets and the stars.

719
00:47:29,159 --> 00:47:33,357
Day 13: We have taken the first
photograph of the Earth and moon...

720
00:47:33,563 --> 00:47:37,090
...as worlds together in space.
A pretty pair.

721
00:47:41,104 --> 00:47:44,631
Day 1 70: A problem
in the deployment of the boom...

722
00:47:44,841 --> 00:47:47,139
...that supports
the science scan platform.

723
00:47:47,344 --> 00:47:49,141
If the problem is not solved...

724
00:47:49,346 --> 00:47:51,940
...we will be unable to take
most of our pictures.

725
00:47:56,186 --> 00:48:01,123
Day 207: Boom problem solved, but
failure of main radio transmitter.

726
00:48:01,658 --> 00:48:03,751
If the backup transmitter
also fails...

727
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:07,225
...no one on Earth
will ever hear from us again.

728
00:48:08,264 --> 00:48:09,458
Day 21 5:

729
00:48:09,666 --> 00:48:11,964
We cross the orbit of Mars...

730
00:48:12,168 --> 00:48:14,295
...and enter the main asteroid belt.

731
00:48:15,905 --> 00:48:20,171
Day 570: We can now make out
finer detail on Jupiter...

732
00:48:20,377 --> 00:48:24,040
...than the largest telescopes
on Earth have ever obtained.

733
00:48:29,052 --> 00:48:30,679
Day 640:

734
00:48:30,887 --> 00:48:34,618
The cloud patterns are distinctive
and gorgeous.

735
00:48:34,824 --> 00:48:36,451
No painter trapped on Earth...

736
00:48:36,659 --> 00:48:39,457
...ever imagined a world
so strange and lovely.

737
00:48:42,699 --> 00:48:46,226
The white clouds are ammonia
crystals, high and cold.

738
00:48:46,436 --> 00:48:49,166
We do not know the nature
of the red-brown clouds.

739
00:48:49,372 --> 00:48:51,966
Maybe phosphorous or sulfur
as a stain.

740
00:48:52,175 --> 00:48:56,612
Perhaps organic molecules of the sort
that led, four billion years ago...

741
00:48:56,813 --> 00:48:59,680
...back on Earth,
to the origin of life.

742
00:48:59,883 --> 00:49:02,579
And what is the great red spot?

743
00:49:03,086 --> 00:49:04,075
(COMPUTER HUMS)

744
00:49:05,355 --> 00:49:08,449
It is an immense swirling column
of gas...

745
00:49:08,658 --> 00:49:10,853
...reaching high above adjacent
clouds.

746
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:13,893
So large that it could hold
half a dozen Earths.

747
00:49:14,097 --> 00:49:17,533
Its motion hypnotizes us.

748
00:49:21,304 --> 00:49:25,104
Some think that the red spot
is a great spinning storm...

749
00:49:25,308 --> 00:49:27,674
...a million years old.

750
00:49:30,914 --> 00:49:35,851
Day 650: Encounter.
A day of wonders.

751
00:49:39,055 --> 00:49:41,148
The ship maneuvers
so we can take pictures...

752
00:49:41,357 --> 00:49:43,985
...of the multi-ringed basin
on Callisto.

753
00:49:48,965 --> 00:49:53,493
Images of the astonishing
lined surface of Ganymede.

754
00:49:58,074 --> 00:50:00,804
A close passage by Europa.

755
00:50:03,179 --> 00:50:05,647
And, a view of volcanic lo.

756
00:50:09,419 --> 00:50:12,855
We successfully negotiate
the treacherous radiation belts...

757
00:50:13,056 --> 00:50:16,492
...and accomplish
the ring plane crossing.

758
00:50:17,627 --> 00:50:20,095
Looking back, we marvel
at the rings...

759
00:50:20,296 --> 00:50:25,063
...and see the sun emerge
from behind the giant planet.

760
00:50:30,039 --> 00:50:34,976
We are outward bound on our mission
to explore the outer solar system.

761
00:50:35,879 --> 00:50:37,870
Ten thousand years from now...

762
00:50:38,081 --> 00:50:41,608
...Voyager will plunge onward
to the stars.

763
00:50:42,752 --> 00:50:47,382
We have made the ships
that sail the sea of space.

764
00:50:51,261 --> 00:50:52,888
We travel past Jupiter...

765
00:50:53,096 --> 00:50:56,395
...three quarters of a billion
kilometers from the sun...

766
00:50:56,933 --> 00:50:59,959
...Saturn, one and a half billion,
Uranus, three billion...

767
00:51:00,169 --> 00:51:04,799
...and Neptune, four and a half
billion kilometers away.

768
00:51:07,877 --> 00:51:09,276
In our ship of the mind...

769
00:51:09,479 --> 00:51:13,745
...we retrace the itinerary
of the two Voyager spacecraft...

770
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:17,647
...on their journeys to Saturn
and beyond.

771
00:51:19,722 --> 00:51:22,987
Saturn was first glimpsed
through the telescope by Galileo.

772
00:51:23,192 --> 00:51:26,127
Its rings first understood by Huygens.

773
00:51:26,329 --> 00:51:30,698
But only now do we begin to penetrate
its deeper mysteries.

774
00:51:36,673 --> 00:51:40,575
Saturn is the second largest planet
in the solar system.

775
00:51:41,444 --> 00:51:45,676
Like Jupiter, it is cloud-covered,
and rotates once every 10 hours.

776
00:51:45,882 --> 00:51:49,215
It has a weaker magnetic field,
a weaker radiation belt...

777
00:51:49,419 --> 00:51:51,683
...and a grand, magnificent...

778
00:51:51,888 --> 00:51:55,085
...exquisite system of rings.

779
00:51:56,793 --> 00:51:59,557
The rings are composed of billions
of tiny moons...

780
00:51:59,762 --> 00:52:02,560
...each circling Saturn
in its own orbit.

781
00:52:03,266 --> 00:52:07,498
The biggest gap in the rings
is called the Cassini Division...

782
00:52:07,704 --> 00:52:10,798
...after the colleague of Huygens
who first discovered it.

783
00:52:11,741 --> 00:52:13,299
There are many other gaps...

784
00:52:13,509 --> 00:52:16,535
...each produced by the periodic
gravitational tugs...

785
00:52:16,746 --> 00:52:18,737
...of one of the larger outer moons.

786
00:52:35,865 --> 00:52:38,356
From just beneath the ring plane...

787
00:52:38,568 --> 00:52:42,231
...we see a sky full of moons.

788
00:53:02,058 --> 00:53:06,654
Within the rings,
the individual moons become visible.

789
00:53:08,531 --> 00:53:12,092
They are orbiting chunks
of snow and ice...

790
00:53:13,436 --> 00:53:15,802
...each perhaps a meter across.

791
00:53:21,344 --> 00:53:24,939
In young parts of the ring system,
there hasn't been enough time...

792
00:53:25,148 --> 00:53:29,517
...for collisions to round the edges
of these fragments...

793
00:53:29,719 --> 00:53:32,210
...the snowballs of Saturn.

794
00:54:18,234 --> 00:54:23,001
Far from the rings,
bathed in its red light...

795
00:54:24,307 --> 00:54:28,073
...we encounter Saturn's immense
cloud-covered moon...

796
00:54:28,277 --> 00:54:29,505
...Titan.

797
00:54:42,458 --> 00:54:44,892
It has an atmosphere
denser than that of Mars...

798
00:54:45,695 --> 00:54:47,526
...and a thick layer of red clouds...

799
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:51,291
...which are probably composed
of complex organic molecules...

800
00:54:51,501 --> 00:54:55,164
...produced by solar ultraviolet light
and other energy sources...

801
00:54:55,371 --> 00:54:57,066
...from the methane-rich air.

802
00:55:04,413 --> 00:55:07,678
No ship from Earth
has ever penetrated those clouds...

803
00:55:07,884 --> 00:55:12,446
...and viewed, close-up,
the surface of this tantalizing world.

804
00:55:18,795 --> 00:55:22,162
It seems likely that the ground
is covered, encrusted...

805
00:55:22,365 --> 00:55:26,426
...with organic molecules
raining from the sky.

806
00:55:32,408 --> 00:55:36,708
There may be volcanoes
and valleys of ice...

807
00:55:36,913 --> 00:55:39,711
...and, just perhaps...

808
00:55:39,916 --> 00:55:44,785
...hiding in the warm places,
some very different kind of life.

809
00:55:52,862 --> 00:55:54,921
Near an ice cliff of Titan...

810
00:55:55,131 --> 00:55:58,498
...through a rare break
in the clouds of organic molecules...

811
00:55:58,701 --> 00:56:03,536
...we can see, looming and lovely,
the ringed planet, Saturn.

812
00:56:05,007 --> 00:56:09,341
It is a view that will still be
appreciated centuries from now...

813
00:56:09,579 --> 00:56:11,740
...by our descendants,
who will know it well.

814
00:56:11,948 --> 00:56:14,348
As well as we have come to know...

815
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:17,883
...Hudson's Bay and the Barents Sea...

816
00:56:18,087 --> 00:56:22,080
...Indonesia, and Australia
and New York.

817
00:56:22,925 --> 00:56:27,521
They will look back to when Titan was
first seen by Voyager spaceships...

818
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:30,893
...on their epic journeys
past the giant planets...

819
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:32,795
...out of the solar system...

820
00:56:33,002 --> 00:56:36,802
...to the great dark
between the stars.

821
00:56:54,257 --> 00:56:56,282
Since Cosmos was first shown...

822
00:56:56,492 --> 00:57:00,394
...Voyager spacecraft have explored
the systems of the planets...

823
00:57:00,596 --> 00:57:03,360
...Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune...

824
00:57:03,566 --> 00:57:08,435
...and have now passed the outermost
planets on their way to the stars.

825
00:57:08,871 --> 00:57:12,568
We inserted the flavor of those
encounters in our captain's log.

826
00:57:13,342 --> 00:57:15,367
But with image processing...

827
00:57:15,578 --> 00:57:19,810
...we've been able to reconstruct
astonishing movies...

828
00:57:20,082 --> 00:57:21,743
...of some of these worlds.

829
00:57:21,951 --> 00:57:25,352
Here, for example, is Jupiter,
with its great red spot.

830
00:57:26,923 --> 00:57:30,188
And volcanic lo, spinning before us.

831
00:57:31,193 --> 00:57:36,130
Icy Enceladus, a tiny moon of Saturn,
on much of which, somehow...

832
00:57:36,599 --> 00:57:38,533
...the craters have melted.

833
00:57:39,735 --> 00:57:42,101
And Miranda, of Uranus.

834
00:57:43,639 --> 00:57:46,369
Austere, blue Neptune.

835
00:57:48,711 --> 00:57:52,112
Or consider Titan,
the giant moon of Saturn.

836
00:57:52,315 --> 00:57:55,682
We've taken the nitrogen and methane
in its atmosphere...

837
00:57:55,885 --> 00:57:59,377
...irradiated it in the lab with
electrons of the sort that are...

838
00:57:59,588 --> 00:58:02,250
...beamed at Titan from
Saturn's magnetic field...

839
00:58:02,458 --> 00:58:05,154
...and we made this stuff...

840
00:58:05,761 --> 00:58:10,198
...which matches, almost perfectly, the
observed properties of the Titan haze.

841
00:58:10,399 --> 00:58:11,491
What is it?

842
00:58:11,701 --> 00:58:14,135
It's a mixture of
complex organic molecules.

843
00:58:14,337 --> 00:58:17,534
You drop some into water and,
among other things, you make...

844
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:20,334
...amino acids,
the building blocks of proteins.

845
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:23,478
So the starting materials of life...

846
00:58:23,679 --> 00:58:27,877
...are raining from the skies
of Titan, like manna from heaven.

847
00:58:28,084 --> 00:58:30,746
I can't wait
until the Cassini mission...

848
00:58:30,953 --> 00:58:35,219
...sends an entry probe
through the organic haze of Titan...

849
00:58:35,424 --> 00:58:37,551
...to its enigmatic surface.

850
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:42,897
The Voyager spacecraft rush on
past the planets and to the stars...

851
00:58:43,132 --> 00:58:45,259
...still returning data.

852
00:58:45,801 --> 00:58:48,463
As it left the planetary part
of the solar system...

853
00:58:48,671 --> 00:58:50,935
...Voyager 1 turned back...

854
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:55,008
...to take one last portrait
of the planets of the solar system.

855
00:58:55,678 --> 00:58:58,613
...and one of those pictures
was of the Earth.

856
00:58:58,814 --> 00:59:03,251
A tiny blue dot, set in a sunbeam.

857
00:59:03,886 --> 00:59:05,217
Here it is.

858
00:59:05,421 --> 00:59:07,946
That's where we live. That's home.

859
00:59:08,157 --> 00:59:12,025
We humans are one species,
and this is our world.

860
00:59:12,528 --> 00:59:14,860
It is our responsibility
to cherish it.

861
00:59:15,064 --> 00:59:19,023
Of all the worlds in our solar system,
the only one, so far as we know...

862
00:59:19,235 --> 00:59:21,135
...graced by life.
