Why?

170
00:19:15,391 --> 00:19:19,012
- Hey, buddy. How the hell are you doing?
- You tell me.

171
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,578
115 over 70, great.

172
00:19:25,658 --> 00:19:27,543
Thank you, Debbie.

173
00:19:32,324 --> 00:19:34,811
No broken bones. That's good.

174

CT scan was negative, no sign of concussion.

- I don't know, maybe one.

00:19:48,249 --> 00:19:50,823
Well, I really have no explanation for that.

179
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:54,376
It's a mystery,
some sort of scientific anomaly.

180
00:19:54,456 --> 00:19:57,342
All I can figure is it's a combination
of genetic good luck...

181
00:19:57,422 --> 00:19:59,311
...and you're one tough son of a bitch.

182
00:19:59,391 --> 00:20:01,344
I would try to get you to quit smoking...

183
00:20:01,424 --> 00:20:03,878
...but I'm afraid it would
do you more harm than good.

184
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,257
You're the only person I would say that to.

185
00:20:07,357 --> 00:20:09,210
So, that's it?

186
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,152
To be clear...

187
00:20:11,604 --> 00:20:13,807
...you were just standing there
and you got light-headed?

188
00:20:13,887 --> 00:20:16,476
- I didn't get light-headed.
- So you just fell down?

189
00:20:16,556 --> 00:20:18,931
Yeah. It was weird.

190
00:20:20,724 --> 00:20:22,017
Well...

191
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:25,950
...I'll wait for these lab tests to come back
and then I'll let you know about that.

192
00:20:26,991 --> 00:20:28,806
That's it?

193
00:20:28,886 --> 00:20:31,376
- That's it.
- I'm not dying?

194
00:20:31,456 --> 00:20:34,590
When it comes to most things like
heart disease or cancer, at your age...

195
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:37,511
- ...if it was gonna kill you, it would've.
- So?

196
00:20:37,591 --> 00:20:41,045
Short of shooting you with a silver bullet
or stabbing you with a wooden stake...

197
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:44,832
...it seems the older you get,
the longer you're gonna live.

198
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:47,228
So, but why did I fall down?

199
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:50,877
- Were you drunk?
- No.

200
00:20:50,957 --> 00:20:54,583
- Do you get light-headed often?
- I don't get light-headed.

201
00:20:54,663 --> 00:20:58,210
- Now do you get much exercise?
- Yeah, I walk around all the time.

202
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:03,474
I do five yoga exercises every day,
twenty-one repetitions each, for years.

203
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:06,623
- Do your knees ever give out?
- No.

204
00:21:09,657 --> 00:21:12,310
I could do a lot more tests,
but I think it's gonna turn out to be...

205
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:15,258
- ...exactly what I think it is.
- What's that?

206
00:21:15,338 --> 00:21:18,544
You're old, and you're getting older.

207
00:21:18,624 --> 00:21:21,300
- That's your diagnosis?
- It's all I got.

208
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,810
Well, that's bullshit.

209
00:21:24,757 --> 00:21:27,277
The body is gonna break down at some point.

210
00:21:27,357 --> 00:21:30,710
As far as I know, nobody has lived forever.
It's gonna happen to all of us.

211
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:35,310
I can do more tests, but I don't want to
do that and you don't want to have it done.

212
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:38,222
So what am I supposed to do?

213
00:21:38,556 --> 00:21:41,344
At this point,
I think it might be a good idea...

214
00:21:41,424 --> 00:21:43,701
...to get an assisted
living person hooked up.

215
00:21:43,781 --> 00:21:45,670
- What?
- Assisted living.

216
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,945
They come by and they help you
cook meals, help you bathe.

217
00:21:49,025 --> 00:21:51,711
Oh, I don't know, I'm on my own.

218
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,143
You never get lonely being alone?

219
00:21:54,223 --> 00:21:58,470
There is a difference between
being lonely and alone.

220
00:22:00,091 --> 00:22:02,744
You know, I saw this happen with my father.

221
00:22:03,024 --> 00:22:06,444
He started to lose his eyesight,
and with it his ability to drive.

222
00:22:06,524 --> 00:22:10,812
It wasn't getting older that bothered him,
it was the loss of his freedom, his mobility.

223
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:15,111
It's all fine as long as you realize
it's all part of the process.

224
00:22:17,157 --> 00:22:18,977
Well, how is your old man?

225
00:22:19,057 --> 00:22:21,856
Oh, buddy, he died a year ago.

226
00:22:23,243 --> 00:22:24,791

227
00:22:26,691 --> 00:22:28,491

don't get to where you are.

or get leukemia or something.

...I wanted to share with you, man.

289

You got a minute?

290
00:29:01,674 --> 00:29:04,964
Yeah. When I was a kid living in Kentucky...

291
00:29:05,646 --> 00:29:08,310
...I had this BB gun.

292
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:10,424
It didn't shoot straight.

293
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:16,610
So I was out one day shooting
at things, trees, leaves.

294
00:29:18,722 --> 00:29:23,521
And there was a mockingbird
up in a tree singing his heart out.

295
00:29:25,856 --> 00:29:27,356
And...

296
00:29:27,823 --> 00:29:31,690
I aimed my gun just to scare him away...

297
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,570
...pulled the trigger...

298

...and the singing stopped.

299

It was the saddest moment in my whole life.

...was devastating.

00:31:26,357 --> 00:31:28,376
...that you're gonna open up
at the end of the game.

318
00:31:28,456 --> 00:31:31,376
And then you systematically
open up all the briefcases...

319
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:34,111
...and the hot chicks show you
how much money you could have won.

320
00:31:34,191 --> 00:31:37,010
And the whole time,
there's this hidden guy...

321
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:41,043
...and he's sitting off stage and he's
offering to buy the case that you chose.

322
00:31:41,123 --> 00:31:45,443
So by the end of the game,
you've opened up all the cases except two.

323
00:31:45,522 --> 00:31:48,874
And you have to decide whether to take
the money from the hidden guy...

324
00:31:48,954 --> 00:31:52,877
...the money that's already in your case
or the case that you haven't chosen yet.

325
00:31:52,957 --> 00:31:56,425
But you don't know what's in your case
or the case you haven't chosen...

326
00:31:56,504 --> 00:31:59,156
...until you actually open it.

327
00:32:00,589 --> 00:32:05,844
So a guy picks a case and I've gotta
wait a fucking hour to see what's in it?

328
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,391
Yeah.

329
00:32:08,522 --> 00:32:11,989
It's a convoluted piece of shit.

330
00:32:25,423 --> 00:32:27,894
Lucky, how you doing, buddy?

331
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:30,810
I haven't a clue, man.

332
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:34,371
- Someone's in a mood.
- Leave him be. He'll snap out of it.

333
00:32:34,451 --> 00:32:36,109
Right, pal?

334
00:32:36,189 --> 00:32:38,776
- ELAINE: Two more cases?
- VINCENT: Yeah, that'll do.

335
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:41,675
- If you want, I can...
- Watch me lift stuff?

336
00:32:41,755 --> 00:32:45,024
Can I help it if I have a strong mind,
but a weak back?

337
00:32:46,455 --> 00:32:48,023
Sit.

338
00:32:56,256 --> 00:33:00,209
I know that look.
Used to see it all the time.

339
00:33:00,289 --> 00:33:04,709
You know where? In the mirror,
my reflection staring back at me.

340
00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:08,311
- VINCENT: And then he met Elaine.
- Hey, who's telling the story?

341
00:33:08,391 --> 00:33:10,943
I'm sorry, but it hasn't exactly
been un-told.

342
00:33:11,023 --> 00:33:13,609
I've told this? You've heard this
before from me? When?

343
00:33:13,689 --> 00:33:16,776
All the time, that's when.
I bet he's heard it, too.

344
00:33:16,856 --> 00:33:20,277
- I've told this? You've heard this?
- <i>Ungatz.</i>

345
00:33:20,956 --> 00:33:24,223
Holy shit, that's right! <i>Ungatz.</i>

346
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:26,985
- Nothing. I was nothing.
- You were a bum.

347
00:33:27,065 --> 00:33:30,043
PAULIE: I was a bum.
I had no plans. I had no ambitions.

348
00:33:30,123 --> 00:33:31,877
- A two-bit hustler.
- PAULIE: That was me.

349
00:33:31,957 --> 00:33:33,876
- And you knew it.
- PAULIE: I did.

350
00:33:33,956 --> 00:33:37,554
I'd look into the mirror
and all I'd see was <i>ungatz.</i>

351
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,924
I hated myself.

352
00:33:41,689 --> 00:33:44,884
- And then what happened?
- You met Elaine.

353
00:33:44,964 --> 00:33:47,943
Jesus, I can't believe it,
you really listen to me.

354
00:33:48,023 --> 00:33:50,028
- That's amazing.
- (LAUGHTER)

355
00:33:50,957 --> 00:33:54,844
Anyway, I met... I met this fantastic woman.

356
00:33:54,924 --> 00:33:59,509
And she met a bum, a deadbeat.
Did she try to change me? No.

357
00:33:59,589 --> 00:34:02,842
Did she expect me to change myself? No.

358
00:34:02,922 --> 00:34:05,829
- She accepted me for who I was.
- Who you are.

359
00:34:05,909 --> 00:34:07,859
Who I am.

360
00:34:07,939 --> 00:34:10,475
I'm still <i>ungatz,</i> nothing.

361
00:34:10,555 --> 00:34:13,641
But I've got everything.

362
00:34:13,721 --> 00:34:16,744
- Isn't that something?
- Something for you.

363
00:34:16,824 --> 00:34:20,997
No, what I'm trying to say is,
if this could happen, you know, to me...

364
00:34:21,077 --> 00:34:22,710
...then it could happen to anyone.

365
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,619
- Even you.
- (SNICKERS)

366
00:34:25,099 --> 00:34:26,622
Bullshit.

367
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:43,375
Jesus Christ.

368
00:34:43,455 --> 00:34:48,076
MAN: I believe we can just get by with
a will and a medical power of attorney.

369
00:34:48,156 --> 00:34:51,189
Howard, where have you been?
I've been waiting for you.

370
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:53,509
Who's this?

371
00:34:53,589 --> 00:34:57,309
Hey, Lucky. This here
is my attorney Bobby Lawrence.

372
00:34:57,388 --> 00:34:59,495
- Nice to meet you, Lucky.
- LUCKY: Hello.

373
00:35:00,355 --> 00:35:02,981
You know why sharks don't eat attorneys?

374
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:06,823
- Uh...
- Professional courtesy.

375
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:11,224
Right, that's an oldie but a goodie.

376
00:35:12,816 --> 00:35:14,976
So did you come here to help find Roosevelt?

377
00:35:15,056 --> 00:35:17,876
No, he's here to help me with my plan.

378
00:35:17,956 --> 00:35:20,676
- What plan?
- End-of-life plan.

379
00:35:20,956 --> 00:35:22,543
Are you dying?

380
00:35:22,623 --> 00:35:25,295
No, he's just preparing for the unexpected.

381
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:27,623
What's unexpected?

382
00:35:28,757 --> 00:35:32,442
Well, I mean, none of us
make it out of this thing alive.

383
00:35:32,522 --> 00:35:35,849
So, knowing that, it'd be a sin
not to prepare for the well-being...

384
00:35:35,929 --> 00:35:37,788
...of your loved ones.

385
00:35:42,156 --> 00:35:44,443
What loved ones do you have, anyway?

386
00:35:44,523 --> 00:35:49,388
When I go, I want to leave all
my possessions to President Roosevelt.

387
00:35:50,173 --> 00:35:52,781
- Your turtle?
- Well, you know, this might not...

388
00:35:52,861 --> 00:35:57,430
Tortoise! And he's still got
at least 100 years left in him.

389
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:00,610
- A hundred years?
- HOWARD: Yeah.

390
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:04,638
- You know, Lucky, you remind me...
- Shut the fuck up!

391
00:36:11,289 --> 00:36:12,790
Okay.

392
00:36:21,489 --> 00:36:23,710
Didn't Roosevelt just run away?

393
00:36:24,389 --> 00:36:28,542
Yeah, but this is for, you know,
when he comes back.

394
00:36:29,089 --> 00:36:32,542
- Is he a homing turtle?
- Tortoise. And no, he's not.

395
00:36:32,622 --> 00:36:36,211
He's gone, Howard, and you're all alone.

396
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:39,214
We come in alone, and we go out alone.

397
00:36:39,293 --> 00:36:41,276
That's awfully bleak.

398
00:36:41,356 --> 00:36:43,576
It's beautiful.

399
00:36:44,255 --> 00:36:47,943
"Alone" comes from two words, all-one.

400
00:36:48,023 --> 00:36:50,976
- It's in the dictionary.
- I miss him!

401
00:36:51,056 --> 00:36:52,878
It'll be okay, Howie.

402
00:36:53,657 --> 00:36:56,542
A tortoise is an amazing creature, Lucky.

403
00:36:56,622 --> 00:37:00,876
They're as noble as a king,
and as kindhearted as a grandmother.

404
00:37:00,956 --> 00:37:04,243
I miss my friend, his company.

405
00:37:04,323 --> 00:37:05,876
I miss his personality.

406
00:37:05,956 --> 00:37:08,243
He's not missing, Howard. He's just not here.

407
00:37:08,323 --> 00:37:10,675
He's there, wherever the fuck that is.

408
00:37:10,755 --> 00:37:13,043
And if he's not there, then he's nowhere.

409
00:37:13,123 --> 00:37:16,906
- Well, I'm sure he's okay.
- Why don't you go fuck yourself?

410
00:37:16,986 --> 00:37:18,199
Oh!

411
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:21,371
You don't give a shit about him.
You're just here to suck him dry.

412
00:37:21,451 --> 00:37:25,543
You lamprey, leach, vulture.

413
00:37:26,023 --> 00:37:29,780
Con him out of his last dime,
just to leave everything to a turtle.

414
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:33,010
Tortoise! He's a tortoise!

415
00:37:33,369 --> 00:37:35,675
You know that saguaro near your yard?

416
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:38,876
That thing was barely a twig
when Roosevelt was born.

417
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:43,455
They're contemporaries, you know?
They watched each other grow up.

418
00:37:45,089 --> 00:37:48,676
President Roosevelt was born
in a hole in the desert.

419
00:37:48,756 --> 00:37:52,154
At that time, a little creature
smaller than my thumb.

420
00:37:52,889 --> 00:37:56,010
And something clicked inside
that little Roosevelt brain...

421
00:37:56,090 --> 00:38:00,356
...and he scampered up out
of that hole and faced the world.

422
00:38:01,689 --> 00:38:04,709
You all think of a tortoise
as something slow.

423
00:38:04,789 --> 00:38:08,077
But I think about the burden
he has to carry on his back.

424
00:38:08,856 --> 00:38:11,009
Yeah, it's for protection.

425
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:14,511
But ultimately, it's the coffin
he's gonna get buried in...

426
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:18,657
...and he has to drag that thing
around his entire life?

427
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:21,895
Go ahead and laugh...

428
00:38:21,975 --> 00:38:23,829
...but he affected me.

429
00:38:24,373 --> 00:38:27,635
You know what I'm saying? He affected me.

430
00:38:28,622 --> 00:38:31,073
There are some things in this universe,
ladies and gentlemen...

431

No. I don't think it's a good idea for you.

00:45:47,523 --> 00:45:48,823
There you go.

470
00:45:50,189 --> 00:45:52,644
So, what do you want?

471
00:45:53,223 --> 00:45:56,405
Well, I was worried about you so I thought
I'd come by and check on you.

472
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,529
You're welcome.

473
00:46:00,609 --> 00:46:02,861
Nice outfit there, cowboy.

474
00:46:07,589 --> 00:46:09,589
Thanks for coming by.

475
00:46:23,623 --> 00:46:27,243
Jesus Christ. How'd you get in here?
I thought you'd left.

476
00:46:27,323 --> 00:46:30,809
I'm sorry, I knocked, the door was unlocked.

477
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:33,322
You scared me to death.

478
00:46:36,789 --> 00:46:39,040
You were such a cute, little boy.

479
00:46:42,246 --> 00:46:45,355
And such a handsome young man in uniform.

480
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:51,845
This photo at the beach, are these your kids?

481
00:46:52,355 --> 00:46:53,922
No.

482
00:46:55,423 --> 00:46:57,804
- Were you ever married?
- No.

483
00:46:59,193 --> 00:47:00,799
Were you?

484
00:47:02,055 --> 00:47:03,625
No.

485
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:10,392
- You got somewhere to be, sailor?
- Uh... no.

486
00:47:13,655 --> 00:47:15,489
Do you like game shows?

487
00:47:18,189 --> 00:47:19,893
Do you smoke grass?

488
00:47:35,256 --> 00:47:37,575
LORETTA: This isn't a game show.

489
00:47:37,655 --> 00:47:39,455
LUCKY: It's ended.

490
00:47:51,721 --> 00:47:55,877
This... he is amazing. Who is this?

491
00:47:55,957 --> 00:47:58,042
Liberace. Didn't you ever hear of him?

492
00:47:58,122 --> 00:48:01,171
Yes, I've heard of him.

493
00:48:01,251 --> 00:48:03,050
He's wonderful.

494
00:48:03,655 --> 00:48:05,943
LUCKY: I feel like such an asshole.

495
00:48:06,572 --> 00:48:08,805
When this guy first came on the scene...

496
00:48:09,755 --> 00:48:12,988
...I wrote him off as just another
extravagant fruit.

497
00:48:14,072 --> 00:48:17,212
If you stop and listen to him,
you'll see he's brilliant!

498
00:48:17,621 --> 00:48:21,282
And I don't know how the hell he plays
with all those rings on his fingers...

499
00:48:21,362 --> 00:48:23,343
...that's even more impressive.

500
00:48:24,722 --> 00:48:26,569
Look at him.

501
00:48:28,156 --> 00:48:33,222
I don't know why I ever gave a shit about
who he was screwing in the first place.

502
00:48:34,522 --> 00:48:36,986
If he was getting laid, more power to him.

503
00:48:41,357 --> 00:48:43,989
Hmm, I can hardly get it up anymore.

504
00:48:47,554 --> 00:48:49,992
LIBERACE: (OVER TV)
<i>I hope I didn't leave anybody out.</i>

505
00:48:50,989 --> 00:48:53,975
<i>Oh, we did leave out somebody.
All you kids...</i>

506
00:48:54,055 --> 00:48:57,363
Oh, shit, I gotta go. I'm late.
I gotta get back to the diner.

507
00:48:57,443 --> 00:48:59,456
Joe is going to kill me.

508
00:49:01,956 --> 00:49:03,688
All right.

509
00:49:12,754 --> 00:49:14,590
LIBERACE: <i>Bunch of liars.</i> (LAUGHTER)

510
00:49:17,089 --> 00:49:19,199
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

511
00:49:19,279 --> 00:49:20,808
Bye.

512
00:49:21,288 --> 00:49:23,342
- Hey.
- Yeah?

513
00:49:24,188 --> 00:49:26,444
Can I tell you a secret?

514
00:49:26,923 --> 00:49:28,522
LORETTA: Absolutely.

515
00:49:29,888 --> 00:49:32,688
You won't tell anyone?

516
00:49:40,323 --> 00:49:42,155
I'm scared.

517
00:49:47,489 --> 00:49:49,322
I know.

518
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:53,522
I know.

519
00:50:24,488 --> 00:50:27,175
Did you ever think about
before you were born?

520
00:50:28,555 --> 00:50:30,842
JOE: No, never did.

521
00:50:31,466 --> 00:50:33,321
What are you talking about?

522
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:36,323
New beginning.

523
00:50:38,655 --> 00:50:42,291
Is that... in the crossword today?

524
00:50:42,722 --> 00:50:44,217
No.

525
00:50:45,347 --> 00:50:49,050
I was just thinking about something that
happened to me when I was about...

526
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:51,555
...12 or 13 years old.

527
00:50:52,323 --> 00:50:54,588
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

528
00:50:56,222 --> 00:50:58,908
I was at my Aunt Beulah's house, alone.

529
00:50:58,988 --> 00:51:00,821
I don't remember why.

530
00:51:02,521 --> 00:51:06,576
And only once, I got this anxiety attack.

531
00:51:06,656 --> 00:51:10,708
I panicked and I was scared to death.
I started thinking there's nothing out there.

532
00:51:10,788 --> 00:51:13,222
It's all black, there's nothing.

533
00:51:14,855 --> 00:51:18,295
And I was... I was scared shitless, man.

534
00:51:19,589 --> 00:51:21,242
13?

535
00:51:21,322 --> 00:51:22,821
Yeah.

536
00:51:26,589 --> 00:51:28,421
What happened?

537
00:51:29,555 --> 00:51:33,180
I don't know, my aunt came back
and that was the end of it.

538
00:51:35,454 --> 00:51:37,475
(DOOR OPENS)

539
00:51:37,555 --> 00:51:41,276
- Hey, Bob, how we doing?
- BOBBY: Little bit worse, I'd be perfect.

540
00:51:41,355 --> 00:51:43,188
JOE: Sit anywhere you like.

541
00:51:52,022 --> 00:51:55,674
Hey, you know what, Joe?
I'll just take a coffee to go.

542
00:51:55,754 --> 00:51:58,676
Oh, okay. Well, I got a pot brewing.

543
00:51:58,756 --> 00:52:00,555
It'll be a minute.

544
00:52:01,388 --> 00:52:03,188
All right.

545
00:52:08,622 --> 00:52:10,191
Morning.

546
00:52:11,185 --> 00:52:12,769
Hi.

547
00:52:14,189 --> 00:52:15,755
Howdy.

548
00:52:22,673 --> 00:52:25,788
So, no, uh... no sign of The President yet.

549
00:52:26,522 --> 00:52:29,147
I hope he turns up soon,
for Howard's sake. The two of them...

550
00:52:29,227 --> 00:52:31,592
- ...are like heterosexual partners.
- Only one thing worse...

551
00:52:31,672 --> 00:52:33,871
...than awkward silence...

552
00:52:34,554 --> 00:52:36,358
...small talk.

553
00:52:40,956 --> 00:52:42,823
Okay, I hear you.

554
00:52:58,254 --> 00:53:00,056
So you doing okay?

555
00:53:01,955 --> 00:53:03,541
Fragile.

556
00:53:03,621 --> 00:53:05,188
Oh.

557
00:53:06,989 --> 00:53:08,076
Why is that?

558
00:53:09,654 --> 00:53:11,676
I fell down.

559
00:53:11,756 --> 00:53:15,008
Ooh, yeah, yeah, that's... that's bad.

560
00:53:15,088 --> 00:53:17,517
Yup. It rung my bell.

561
00:53:21,588 --> 00:53:23,674
A couple years ago...

562
00:53:23,754 --> 00:53:27,241
...I was heading to my daughter's
school to pick her up.

563
00:53:27,321 --> 00:53:31,185
And as I'm turning around the corner,
you know, going to the parking lot...

564
00:53:31,264 --> 00:53:33,308
...there's a garbage truck that...

565
00:53:33,388 --> 00:53:36,078
...I mean, just barely missed me.

566
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:40,570
There was no more room between my car
and that truck than between me and this tie.

567
00:53:41,022 --> 00:53:42,857
A half a second...

568
00:53:43,738 --> 00:53:46,380
...a half a second made all the difference.

569
00:53:48,389 --> 00:53:52,864
Two minutes later, my daughter hops into
the car as if nothing's happened, and...

570
00:53:54,322 --> 00:53:56,388
...I guess nothing has.

571
00:53:57,455 --> 00:53:59,288
But, uh...

572
00:54:03,855 --> 00:54:05,863
...it really shook me to the core.

573
00:54:09,023 --> 00:54:13,428
Yeah, I got hair standing up
on my arms just thinking about it.

574
00:54:15,088 --> 00:54:18,409
- Here we go, Bob.
- Oh, thank you.

575
00:54:18,489 --> 00:54:20,375
Gratis, counselor.

576
00:54:20,855 --> 00:54:22,688
Thanks, Joe.

577
00:54:23,755 --> 00:54:25,548
Do you mind if I sit down?

578
00:54:27,022 --> 00:54:28,685
Well, sit down.

579
00:54:31,422 --> 00:54:33,605
Do you have any kids, Lucky?

580
00:54:34,722 --> 00:54:37,787
None that I'm totally sure of, no.

581
00:54:38,589 --> 00:54:41,309
- You married?
- Never been married.

582
00:54:41,389 --> 00:54:43,254
Ever in love?

583
00:54:44,188 --> 00:54:46,009
Yeah, I guess so.

584
00:54:46,089 --> 00:54:48,462
Ah, so it goes, huh?

585
00:54:54,122 --> 00:54:56,195
Well, "The future's not ours to see."

586
00:54:57,654 --> 00:54:59,875
Hell, I've made a whole career out of that.

587
00:55:00,654 --> 00:55:04,209
Wills and trusts, you know, it's about
planning for things that you can't foresee.

588
00:55:04,289 --> 00:55:07,809
Just because you can't see 'em,
doesn't mean they're not gonna happen.

589
00:55:07,889 --> 00:55:11,833
- It is written.
- Mm-hm, somewhere.

590
00:55:14,288 --> 00:55:17,341
You know, I came home
with my daughter that day...

591
00:55:17,421 --> 00:55:19,626
...and I sat down, I made a will.

592
00:55:19,856 --> 00:55:23,662
I wrote end-of-life directives,
I upped my life insurance.

593
00:55:24,121 --> 00:55:26,387
I paid up front for my cremation.

594
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:29,638
So now, if something happens to me...

595
00:55:34,756 --> 00:55:37,076
...when something happens to me...

596
00:55:38,055 --> 00:55:43,139
...my family doesn't have to worry
about the bureaucracy of death.

597
00:55:43,821 --> 00:55:45,654
You know?

598
00:55:46,088 --> 00:55:48,108
They just call one number...

599
00:55:48,988 --> 00:55:50,784
...and my body's gone
by the end of the day...

600
00:55:50,864 --> 00:55:54,679
...and they don't have to worry about
anything for the rest of their life.

601
00:55:54,989 --> 00:55:58,909
Well, this doesn't change
anything for you, this scenario.

602
00:55:58,989 --> 00:56:02,655
- Why not?
- You're still dead.

603
00:57:05,121 --> 00:57:08,987
How are you doin'?
Hey, how you doing, sweetheart?

604
00:57:14,922 --> 00:57:16,862
Hey, Lucky.

605
00:57:17,621 --> 00:57:20,075
- What's her name?
- Fiona.

606
00:57:20,555 --> 00:57:24,175
Hey, Fiona, you're a fine cut of a dog.

607
00:57:24,855 --> 00:57:26,607
- Yeah.
- Do you have any pets?

608
00:57:26,687 --> 00:57:29,172
- No.
- You ever think about adopting one?

609
00:57:29,252 --> 00:57:30,458
No.

610
00:57:30,538 --> 00:57:33,175
I got plenty inside who need a forever home.

611
00:57:33,255 --> 00:57:35,341
A what? What's a forever home?

612
00:57:35,421 --> 00:57:39,202
That's when someone adopts an animal and
then they have a permanent place to live.

613
00:57:40,688 --> 00:57:42,338
Nothing is permanent.

614
00:57:43,522 --> 00:57:45,721
Come inside, I'll show you around.

615
00:57:52,654 --> 00:57:54,768
It's like the wild kingdom in here.

616
00:57:55,187 --> 00:57:56,836
Aren't they beautiful?

617
00:57:56,916 --> 00:57:59,855
Yeah, and loud.

618
00:58:05,234 --> 00:58:09,207
- Do you have any mockingbirds?
- No, but I can order you one.

619
00:58:09,287 --> 00:58:11,120
No, thanks.

620
00:58:18,489 --> 00:58:22,108
- LUCKY: Are these tortoises?
- FRANCES: No, they're baby turtles.

621
00:58:23,187 --> 00:58:25,641
My friend Howard's tortoise ran away.

622
00:58:25,721 --> 00:58:28,342
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

623
00:58:28,875 --> 00:58:31,174
He said they could live to be 100 years.

624
00:58:31,254 --> 00:58:34,275
Oh, absolutely. In some cases,
I've heard of 200 years.

625
00:58:34,355 --> 00:58:36,008
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

626
00:58:36,088 --> 00:58:37,655
Wow.

627
00:58:41,856 --> 00:58:44,305
- And what are these?

Anywhere you like.

634
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:01,117

635

Yes, sir.

- You?
- Navy.

01:01:09,021 --> 01:01:11,993
Okay, okay. You guys are great.

638

You always gave us a lift to the fight.

639
01:01:17,054 --> 01:01:20,608

didn't have the mental capacity...

the inner workings of a ship.

656
01:02:23,854 --> 01:02:28,922
I was a cook. On paper, that's supposed
to be the easiest job in the Navy.

01:02:39,055 --> 01:02:41,943
We called it a large, slow target.

661

We were hauling ammunition
for the big battleships.

662

More like riding a stick of dynamite.

663
01:02:50,655 --> 01:02:54,008
You ever get a ship shot out
from underneath you?

664
01:02:54,088 --> 01:02:55,942
Almost once.

665
01:02:56,721 --> 01:02:59,242
Every day in the evening glare...

666
01:02:59,322 --> 01:03:02,909
...the suicide planes
came in low over the water...

667
01:03:03,389 --> 01:03:06,476
...with the sun behind them,
to hit our ships.

668
01:03:07,155 --> 01:03:10,907
So one day, this suicide plane was coming...

669
01:03:10,987 --> 01:03:14,009
...right towards our ammunition ship.

670
01:03:14,589 --> 01:03:17,212
And all at once...

671
01:03:17,292 --> 01:03:19,440
...about 100 yards away...

672
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:23,787
...it went up into the air
and slid back down into the water.

673
01:03:23,921 --> 01:03:26,474
Some of our small arms fire
had hit the pilot.

674
01:03:26,554 --> 01:03:29,787
- Lucky shot.
- Not for the pilot.

675
01:03:31,288 --> 01:03:34,288
Did you go straight to
the Philippines from boot camp?

676
01:03:35,122 --> 01:03:38,308
No, we stopped in Tarawa
and Okinawa on the way...

677
01:03:38,388 --> 01:03:40,272
...just to show them what <i>fer.</i>

- Oh, thank you, dear.

- You're welcome.
- Thank you very much.

681
01:03:53,188 --> 01:03:56,783
I still think about those people
on the islands, hiding away in caves...

682
01:03:56,863 --> 01:03:58,753
...afraid of us.

683
01:03:59,289 --> 01:04:04,095
The Japs said that we were going
to rape and kill them all.

684
01:04:07,022 --> 01:04:08,860
So, we secured the beach...

685
01:04:10,421 --> 01:04:14,820
...and the locals who survived
that goddamn fire fight...

686
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:20,267
...start throwing their children off
the cliffs, and then following them.

687
01:04:21,688 --> 01:04:25,930
I guess they thought suicide
was better than facing us.

688
01:04:27,321 --> 01:04:30,777
I remember this little girl,
couldn't have been more than seven...

689
01:04:30,857 --> 01:04:32,656
...in rags.

690
01:04:34,855 --> 01:04:38,014
I don't know, she saw us coming,
I guess, and right out of nowhere...

691
01:04:38,094 --> 01:04:40,342
...out of a hole or wherever it was...

692
01:04:41,321 --> 01:04:43,541
...and she had this...

693
01:04:43,621 --> 01:04:48,243
...God, this beautiful smile on her face.

694
01:04:49,222 --> 01:04:52,475
And it wasn't a facade, it was
coming from somewhere inside...

695
01:04:52,554 --> 01:04:55,441
...from the center of herself.

696
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:58,044
Good Lord, in that shit hole...

697
01:04:58,124 --> 01:05:00,584
...something like that really stands out.

698
01:05:01,988 --> 01:05:05,199
It stopped us in our track. Here we were...

699
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:08,899
...all covered with shit,
pieces of people everywhere...

700
01:05:08,979 --> 01:05:13,209
...and I couldn't see a tree left.
And she's grinning from ear to ear.

701
01:05:14,887 --> 01:05:17,475
So I said to my corpsman, I said...

702
01:05:17,554 --> 01:05:20,388
"...Look at this, we got somebody
who's happy to see us."

703
01:05:21,421 --> 01:05:25,242
And he said, "She's not happy
to see you. She's a Buddhist.

704
01:05:25,921 --> 01:05:30,200
She thinks she's gonna be killed,
and she's smiling at her fate."

705
01:05:33,419 --> 01:05:38,141
When I think about that little girl's
beautiful face, and that smile...

706
01:05:38,221 --> 01:05:40,740
...in the midst of all that horror...

707
01:05:40,820 --> 01:05:42,921
...and how she summoned...

708
01:05:45,455 --> 01:05:46,989
...joy.

709
01:05:51,620 --> 01:05:54,469

for that kind of bravery.

in making sure I couldn't find him.

And then I started to realize
that he wasn't leaving me.

He was just going off someplace else to

Well, it ain't '68 anymore, sweetheart.

787
01:14:34,954 --> 01:14:37,254
One of these days,
I'm just going to light up.

788
01:14:46,454 --> 01:14:49,130
My place, my rules.

789
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:51,674
Ownership is a fallacy.

790
01:14:51,754 --> 01:14:54,173
Why can't you just live by the rules?

791
01:14:54,253 --> 01:14:57,707
Authority is arbitrary and subjective.

792
01:14:57,787 --> 01:15:02,486
This is the same kind of attitude
that got you 86-ed from Eve's.

793
01:15:03,887 --> 01:15:06,034
- What do you know of it?
- I know you lit up.

794
01:15:06,114 --> 01:15:07,808
That's what you think happened.

795
01:15:07,888 --> 01:15:10,168
If you didn't light up,
why did they kick you out?

796
01:15:10,248 --> 01:15:12,707
They didn't kick me out, I walked out.

797
01:15:12,787 --> 01:15:15,738
- That's a good story.
- I like that story.

798
01:15:15,818 --> 01:15:18,345
- It's not a story.
- ELAINE: Then what is it?

799
01:15:18,425 --> 01:15:22,374
- It's the truth.
- The truth is, you lit up!

800
01:15:22,454 --> 01:15:26,674
It's not about the cigarettes,
it's about what I know happened...

801
01:15:26,754 --> 01:15:29,747
- ...and what you think happened.
- I wish I had been there.

802
01:15:29,827 --> 01:15:32,107
You could have been there
and still have missed it.

803
01:15:32,187 --> 01:15:35,774
You broke the rules.
You got busted and banned.

804
01:15:35,854 --> 01:15:39,540
- That's the truth.
- How about if we all agree to disagree?

805
01:15:39,620 --> 01:15:43,620
No. I know the truth and the truth matters!

806
01:15:45,010 --> 01:15:47,620
It's a thing. Right?

807
01:15:49,086 --> 01:15:52,374
Yes, truth is a thing.

808
01:15:52,454 --> 01:15:56,874
It's the truth of who we are and what we do.

809
01:15:57,654 --> 01:16:01,140
And you have to face that, and accept it.

810
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:05,420
Because the truth of the universe is waiting.

811
01:16:09,121 --> 01:16:11,904
- I'm lost.
- The truth of what is...

812
01:16:11,984 --> 01:16:14,108
...for all of us.

813
01:16:14,188 --> 01:16:15,355
Which is?

814
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:22,254
That it's all going to go away.

815
01:16:23,822 --> 01:16:28,313
You, you, you, you, me,
this cigarette, everything...

816
01:16:29,754 --> 01:16:32,788
...into blackness, the void.

817
01:16:34,986 --> 01:16:37,186
And nobody's in charge.

818
01:16:38,353 --> 01:16:40,170
And you're left with...

819
01:16:42,153 --> 01:16:44,186
<i>...ungatz.</i>

820
01:16:46,353 --> 01:16:48,173
<i>Ungatz.</i>

821
01:16:48,253 --> 01:16:51,090
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

822
01:16:52,389 --> 01:16:54,880
That's... that's all there is.

823
01:16:58,288 --> 01:17:01,721
- And what do you do with that?
- What do we do with that?

824
01:17:10,954 --> 01:17:12,820
You smile.

825
01:21:46,553 --> 01:21:48,583
