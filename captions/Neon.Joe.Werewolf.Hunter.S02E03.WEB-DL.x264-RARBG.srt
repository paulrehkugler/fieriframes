for free in my private prison.

"Big Larry" was
never heard from again.

so you can murder me
for being a Hebrew.

Hey, tummy, you okay?

I do have ulterior motives.

I'm having a little
trouble training her.

156

Sometimes it seems like
she doesn't want

157
00:07:05,695 --> 00:07:07,032
anything to do with me.

158
00:07:07,033 --> 00:07:08,387
Huh.

159
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:11,625
Well, that sound to me
like maybe she don't trust you.

160
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:12,962
Can't say I blame her, though,

161

how I hold the wheel?

00:07:17,644 --> 00:07:19,538
Well, you grip too tight.

164
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,770
Makes for a jerky ride.

165
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,635
Want to be loose and giving,
but in control.

166
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:27,605
Let me show you.
Let's loosen that belt, huh?

167
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:30,049
Rules of the road, huh?

168
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,919
You want your heart or not?

169
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,788
Uh... I just talking
to my tum-tum.

170
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,119
Yeah, when my tummy get hungry,

171
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,931
I got to, like, talk it down
and, you know...

172
00:07:39,932 --> 00:07:41,157
Where are them snacks at?

173
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:45,563
You seen this guy?

174
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:47,166
You just missed him.

175
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:51,997
He left with this horse pervert
in a black CRV.

176
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,095
Thanks.

177
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:55,566
Hey, help yourself
to some snacks...

178
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:57,476
on the house.

179
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:00,578
I'm one of you.

180
00:08:00,581 --> 00:08:03,081
No, you're not.
Nazi scum!

181
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:07,317
All right, he couldn't
have got that far.

182
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:09,921
Let's get that Neon goy.

183
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:13,792
I have been with...

184
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:15,134
a lot of horses.

185
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:18,497
You know, but, ooh.

186
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:20,469
None of them compare to Carol.

187
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:24,337
She is just luxurious,
if you know what I mean.

188
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:27,308
I want our relationship to be
more than physical,

189
00:08:27,309 --> 00:08:30,977
but I don't think that she does.

190
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:32,438
Maybe this is all
it could ever be.

191
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:35,106
Yeah, how about we give
all the horse talk a break?

192
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:36,615
Sure.

193
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:38,777
I'm getting tired anyway.

194
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:40,185
Oh, there's a motel.

195
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,447
Oh, great.

196
00:08:41,455 --> 00:08:44,715
Yeah, we check in,
I give you a hand-job,

197
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:46,685
morning, we go
our separate ways.

198
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,031
I just need to get some sleep.

199
00:08:48,032 --> 00:08:50,458
You can stop
offering me hand-jobs.

200
00:08:50,464 --> 00:08:52,164
All right, suit yourself.

201
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:54,825
Guess I'll start calling
this hand Benjamin Franklin,

202
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:59,135
'cause a hand-job saved
is a hand-job earned.

203
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:05,483
Who did this to you?

204
00:09:05,484 --> 00:09:07,479
A gang of Jewish skinheads.

205
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:09,551
It wasn't the Chosen Oy Vey
Matzah Ball Gang

206
00:09:09,552 --> 00:09:10,750
by any chance, was it?

207
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:12,021
That's exactly who it was, yeah.

208
00:09:12,022 --> 00:09:14,188
All right.
Let's get out of here.

209
00:09:14,189 --> 00:09:17,857
Well, hey, look, help yourself
to some snacks on the way out...

210
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:21,227
on the house.

211
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:22,588
I'm one of you.

212
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:26,356
Oh, yeah, and they were looking
for that werewolf hunter

213
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:28,366
who escaped from prison.

214
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:30,438
No shit, dickhead.

215
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,946
There's the black CRV.

216
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:44,879
All right, let's get that goy

217
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:46,275
on the count of three.

218
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:49,016
One, two, goy!

219
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,110
There's our guys. Move!

220
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,621
- Where's Neon Joe?
- I don't know. He left!

221
00:10:18,622 --> 00:10:20,089
- Where'd he go?
- I-I don't know!

222
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:23,417
- You're a liar!
- FBI, put down the gun!

223
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:25,523
Screw you, goy!

224
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:32,160
That didn't sound too good.

225
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:33,425
Good thing he kicked you out

226
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:36,473
for offering up
another hand-job.

227
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,346
How do.

228
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:48,977
Thanks for stopping,
he-yump.

229
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,916
Where you heading, cowboy?

230
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:52,777
Vance Dontay's mansion.

231
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:57,956
You mean the Elon Musk-type
inventor billionaire?

232
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,988
That the guy.
Well, hope on in.

233
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,694
I'll give you a lift.

234
00:11:02,696 --> 00:11:06,296
Appreciate that, he-yump.

235
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:09,869
Yeah. And...

236
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,940
don't you worry
up in he-yump.

237
00:11:11,941 --> 00:11:13,638
I know the drill.

238
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:27,518
Man.

239
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:30,990
Business has been down
ever since Joe went to jail.

240
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:32,560
I can't figure out
what happened.

241
00:11:32,561 --> 00:11:35,159
Probably that the main draw,
Neon Joe, isn't here.

242
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:36,831
Yeah, but everything
else is the same.

243
00:11:36,832 --> 00:11:38,700
We got the same cool atmosphere.

244
00:11:38,701 --> 00:11:40,829
Drink by the sip.

245
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:42,968
What's the missing ingredient?

246
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:47,339
I could wear a Joe mask.

247
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,740
I got it!

248
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:50,376
Yuri's not here.

249
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,177
Everyone loves his crazy stories

250
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:55,379
about the moon having a vagina
and werewolf hearts.

251
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,252
And he used to be a cosmonaut.

252
00:11:57,253 --> 00:12:02,088
Every bar needs its fly,
and Yuri was our fly.

253
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:06,889
Kind of like every girl
needs her soul mate.

254
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,227
All right, Ashley.

255
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,598
We get it...
you're into Neon Joe.

256
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:14,397
Well, guess what. I am trying
to save his bar right now.

257
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:17,837
So if you could try
to give your lustful desires

258
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:21,107
for his hot body a rest, please.

259
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:22,768
You saw this, right?

260
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:24,576
Yes.

261
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:26,278
I got it!

262
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:29,948
Hey, everybody!

263
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,580
We're gonna have a competition!

264
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,629
Joe, don't leave me!

265
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,598
Help me!

266
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:48,299
Oh!

267
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,977
How long we been here?

268
00:12:57,978 --> 00:13:00,146
Eight hours.

269
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:02,977
I... I wanted
to let you sleep.

270
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:05,783
You looked so peaceful.

271
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:10,816
You remind me of my Daniel.

272
00:13:10,824 --> 00:13:13,592
Oh, that your son?

273
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:17,033
Oh.
No.

274
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:20,825
Well, thanks
for the ride, Diane.

275
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:23,669
Sad to see you go, Neon Joe.

276
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,000
Yeah, you, too.

277
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:27,935
And don't forget,
you make it to Oahu Joe's,

278
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:29,511
you drink for free all night.

279
00:13:29,512 --> 00:13:32,439
I'll bring my Daniel.

280
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:33,435
All right.

281
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:36,446
I'm sorry I don't have a penis.

282
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:39,379
I would have loved
the hand-job.

283
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,700
What the he-yump?!

284
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:56,501
He alive?

285
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:59,703
This smell fishier
than a dead raccoon butthole.

286
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:00,866
Isn't that Plaid Jeff,

287
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:03,144
the greatest werewolf hunter
of all time?

288
00:14:03,145 --> 00:14:05,878
What?! Man, he ain't
even top five.

289
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:08,379
I don't know. I mean, I know
a few werewolves he's killed,

290
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:10,451
and they all say he's the best.

291
00:14:10,452 --> 00:14:12,280
Yeah, that's 'cause
they never had

292
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:16,115
the displeasure
of getting killed by me.

293
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,090
Hey, where'd you go?

294
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:28,630
Hello, Joe.

295
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:30,865
So you faked Plaid Jeff's
murder, framed me.

296
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:32,471
Why?

297
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:36,909
You abandoned your ex-wife
in her greatest hour of need.

298
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,078
Why are you here, Joe?

299
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:41,579
Ghost wolf helped me break
out of prison in exchange

300
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:43,819
for me helping him
get his heart back.

301
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,077
You're helping the werewolf

302
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:47,085
that tried to kill
your ex-wife?

303
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:50,047
Unbelievable.

304
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:53,386
Why you care about
my ex-wife so much anyway?

305
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:56,732
Ghost wolf told me she alive.
You done show me her ring.

306
00:14:56,733 --> 00:14:58,500
What the he-yump going on?

307
00:14:58,501 --> 00:15:03,098
He's your ex-wife,
that's what!

308
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:06,872
Yes.
I'm your ex-wife.

309
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:10,509
Well, I'll be
a ding-dong-doing.

310
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:14,250
Now, that's one story
I got to sit down for.

311
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:28,863
What are you doing?

312
00:15:28,864 --> 00:15:30,462
You see, the comfort
of the chair

313
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:32,798
needs to be
in perfect proportion

314
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:35,768
to the discomfort of the news.

315
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:39,599
Kind of like pairing
a wine with a meal.

316
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:43,466
Now, that ain't good no more.
Let me see the ding dong, yeah.

317
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:45,636
See, the reason
I so concerned is because

318
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:48,445
a long time ago,
a girl broke up with me.

319
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,448
Yeah, we'd only been
dating about three weeks,

320
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,719
but the chair I chose
to receive the news,

321
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,788
it was all wrong.

322
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:58,457
I was devastated for weeks.

323
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,658
Anyway, this one seem all right.

324
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:05,001
Corner is usually a good spot
to get weird or bad news.

325
00:16:05,002 --> 00:16:07,098
Yeah, this feels good.

326
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,969
Yeah, that right.
Proceed.

327
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,670
We were outside
the pretzel factory,

328
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:15,012
hunting werewolf.

329
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:18,676
And you ran away.

330
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:20,646
Joe, don't leave me!

331
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:21,977
Aah!

332
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:23,749
But you kept on running.

333
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,819
Just as the werewolf
was about to eat me,

334
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,620
a spotlight appeared.

335
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:31,690
It was a military helicopter

336
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:34,360
and the distraction I needed.

337
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:38,200
I shot a silver bullet through
his stupid party dad hat.

338
00:16:38,201 --> 00:16:39,798
The military had
been keeping tabs

339
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:42,029
on all werewolf
hunting activity.

340
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:44,465
They were following
us for years.

341
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:46,041
They were in the Netherlands
when you sentenced

342
00:16:46,042 --> 00:16:49,769
a werewolf to death for
infiltrating national justice.

343
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:54,376
They were there
for the Fun Zone Killings.

344
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:56,849
The Fun Zone Killings,
Part II...

345
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,350
popcorn, peanuts,

346
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,387
and were-death.

347
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:03,548
I was in rough shape
when they found me.

348
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,516
- We're losing her.
- The military felt

349
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:07,785
that it would be better to
rebuild me than repair me,

350
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:10,396
so I told them
to make me into a man

351
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:12,827
with a completely new identity.

352
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:16,902
And only goal...
to get revenge on you.

353
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:18,570
Me? Why?

354
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:20,739
Because you left me to die.

355
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,040
I'm glad you alive,
but we had a deal.

356
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:26,244
The deal was one of us
about to die,

357
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:27,746
the other one run away,

358
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:30,516
live to fight another day,
keep hunting werewolves.

359
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:32,247
I didn't think
you'd stick to it.

360
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:35,888
Not only is my dead
ex-wife still alive...

361
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,589
I kept my vagina.

362
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:44,930
I got to sit down again,
but need a new seat.

363
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:47,001
Oh, he-yump, yeah.
That... that real nice.

364
00:17:47,002 --> 00:17:48,430
Now, come again, he-yump?

365
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:50,395
Enough about his vagina.

366
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,203
What about my heart?

367
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:53,695
You brought the ghost
of the werewolf

368
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:56,006
that killed me into my home?!

369
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:57,539
Wait, they can see you?

370
00:17:57,544 --> 00:18:00,214
Yeah, I can make myself visible
to anyone I want...

371
00:18:00,215 --> 00:18:02,748
like those responsible
for my death.

372
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,779
Not once, but twice.

373
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:07,294
Anyway, I wasn't always
a werewolf, you know?

374
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:10,456
Once upon a time,
I was a man with a family.

375
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:13,557
I took my kid
to his favorite spot

376
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,129
because he won flag football.

377
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,400
But you and your wife showed up

378
00:18:18,401 --> 00:18:21,298
and caused a werewolf
to bite me,

379
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:23,969
turning me into a beast.

380
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,400
And then several years later,

381
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:27,605
your wife killed me
and took my heart.

382
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,537
Oh, okay, man, look, it was
nothing personal, all right?

383
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:32,813
You a werewolf. We just
doing out jobs, right?

384
00:18:32,814 --> 00:18:35,152
Just let me have my heart,
and I'll go.

385
00:18:35,153 --> 00:18:36,948
We had a deal, Neon Joe.

386
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,317
Yeah.

387
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:40,048
We had a deal.

388
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:42,921
And I always honor my deals.

389
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:44,156
Unlike some people I know

390
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:45,487
that just pretend
a deal never happened.

391
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:47,092
Oh, you're not
talking about me, are you?

392
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:48,560
Oh, I am talking about you.

393
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:50,091
Because I seem to remember
We had a deal, then you...

394
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:52,226
You remember the deal,
the original deal that we had?

395
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:57,297
My heart, go get it now.

396
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,067
Yeah, yeah.
We get that heart.

397
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:02,073
Go ahead, get that heart.

398
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:03,735
You have eternal peace.

399
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:05,513
Yeah, we got it.
Just open the box

400
00:19:05,514 --> 00:19:07,412
and let's give him this heart.

401
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:10,751
Is this some kind of joke?

402
00:19:10,752 --> 00:19:12,650
Where the heart?
It was... I don't know.

403
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,021
What do you mean you don't know?

404
00:19:14,022 --> 00:19:15,620
Where is it?
I don't know.

405
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:17,022
How you not know
where the heart is?

406
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:21,026
You had it in the box.
Where's the damn heart?!

407
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:25,357
It's been a grueling
competition, but, unfortunately,

408
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:27,265
there can be only one

409
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:31,867
new cool gimmick barfly
at Oahu Joe's.

410
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:37,309
And the winner
and new Yuri is...

411
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,340
Aah!

412
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,978
Nobody replace Yuri!

413
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:42,479
Everybody out!

414
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:45,217
Yuri, where you been?

415
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:47,748
Collecting final
piece of puzzle.

416
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,862
Those are weird looking
jigsaw pieces.

417
00:19:56,863 --> 00:20:00,732
39 werewolf hearts.

418
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:06,638
40th wolf heart
to fulfill the prophesy.

419
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:09,039
Huh?

420
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:28,657
Finally the world
will see Yuri isn't crazy

421
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:32,197
and that moon is alive!

422
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:36,498
Al-i-i-i-i-i-i-ve!

423
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,939
Hold up, just put the gun down.

424
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,270
We gonna find the heart.

425
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:45,735
My hand.
What's happening to me?

426
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:46,835
No!

427
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:49,476
No!

428
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,677
Trail's gone cold.

429
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:55,546
Neon Joe is in the wind.

430
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:57,455
I don't even want to think
about what happens

431
00:20:57,457 --> 00:21:00,057
if we don't find him.

432
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:02,959
Do we call Daggert?

433
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:05,962
You already did.

434
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,106
♪♪

435
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:17,737
Ladies and gentlemen, we're
getting reports from Japan,

436
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:19,614
where it's nighttime right now,

437
00:21:19,615 --> 00:21:22,781
that the moon
is starting to rotate...

438
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,382
an unprecedented moment

439
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:25,953
as for the first time
in history,

440
00:21:25,954 --> 00:21:28,322
the world will lay
its collective eyes

441
00:21:28,323 --> 00:21:31,721
on the dark side of the moon.

442
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:34,164
And as you can see
from this stunning footage,

443
00:21:34,165 --> 00:21:40,630
the dark side of the moon
appears to be a gigantic arse.
