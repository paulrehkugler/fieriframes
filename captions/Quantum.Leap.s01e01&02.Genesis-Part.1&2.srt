1
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:42,245
You know what I would love to do?

2
00:00:45,225 --> 00:00:50,857
I would love to... fix that flat for you,
but I can't. I mean...

3
00:00:50,931 --> 00:00:54,162
It's your only tux,
and you're late for your wedding.

4
00:00:54,234 --> 00:00:57,260
How could I be late?
We've just met.

5
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:03,733
I'm a lot friendlier than he is.

6
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,905
That's what I'm afraid of.

7
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,510
Wow!

8
00:01:14,588 --> 00:01:16,783
Kick in the butt, ain't it?

9
00:01:16,857 --> 00:01:18,848
I never felt anything like it.

10
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,760
Ooh, who makes this?

11
00:01:22,863 --> 00:01:26,697
Oh, this?
This is an experimental model.

12
00:01:28,702 --> 00:01:30,693
Look at that.

13
00:01:35,108 --> 00:01:39,408
- Oh, that's, uh, sheet lightning.
- I never saw lightning like that before.

14
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,879
And there are no clouds.
I can see the stars.

15
00:01:44,284 --> 00:01:47,310
You know, that's about where they
set off the first atomic bomb.

16
00:01:47,387 --> 00:01:50,982
No kidding.

17
00:01:51,058 --> 00:01:54,391
And some people say there's
still a top secret project out there.

18
00:01:54,461 --> 00:01:57,624
Something to do with
the deep space probe or a...

19
00:01:57,698 --> 00:02:00,565
- Control!
- What's happening, Gooshie?

20
00:02:00,634 --> 00:02:04,934
He's leaping.
Ziggy said no, but Sam's leaping.

21
00:02:05,005 --> 00:02:08,634
- He can't leap. We're not ready.
- Tell Sam that!

22
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:13,112
- Put him on!
- I can't. He's in the accelerator.

23
00:02:22,222 --> 00:02:25,487
Al-Al, what do I do?

24
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:27,789
Nothing. Any interference
could kill him.

25
00:02:27,861 --> 00:02:29,852
I'll be there in two minutes.

26
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,524
Hang on, beautiful.

27
00:04:13,734 --> 00:04:15,759
We did it.

28
00:04:15,836 --> 00:04:18,964
Did what?

29
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,568
I can't remember.

30
00:04:23,643 --> 00:04:26,237
I can't remember anything.

31
00:04:26,313 --> 00:04:28,577
Who am I?

32
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,574
Where am I?

33
00:04:36,523 --> 00:04:40,118
I'll put the coffee on, Tom.

34
00:04:40,193 --> 00:04:43,128
Oh, boy.

35
00:04:43,196 --> 00:04:45,187
I'm in big trouble here.

36
00:04:45,265 --> 00:04:47,961
I don't even remember going to bed
with this woman, whoever she is.

37
00:04:48,034 --> 00:04:51,936
And whoever she is,
she's certainly... pregnant.

38
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,474
Very pregnant.

39
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:57,533
Good morning.

40
00:05:03,917 --> 00:05:07,512
What will I be you okay?

41
00:05:07,587 --> 00:05:10,488
<i>The secretary of state
appeared to be acting as a go-between... </i>

42
00:05:10,557 --> 00:05:13,924
<i>at the United Nations in an effort to
cool down the heightened tensions between... </i>

43
00:05:13,994 --> 00:05:16,554
Tom, better hurry up.

44
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,497
Bird Dog's gonna be here to pick you up
in about 10 minutes.

45
00:05:19,566 --> 00:05:21,864
Oh, honey, the P. X. was out
of your shaving cream,

46
00:05:21,935 --> 00:05:24,267
so I got you some of that stuff, uh...

47
00:05:24,337 --> 00:05:27,773
What do you call it? The one with
the cute little signs on the highway.

48
00:05:29,843 --> 00:05:32,141
"Burma Shave?"
Oh, that's it.

49
00:05:32,212 --> 00:05:35,477
Burma Shave.
I love those little signs.

50
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:40,452
What's taking you so long?
You gotta hurry up. Come on.

51
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,511
Get in there.

52
00:05:46,626 --> 00:05:49,857
Oh, Tom. Sometimes...

53
00:05:53,767 --> 00:05:55,928
It's a dream.

54
00:05:56,002 --> 00:05:58,698
That's it. I'm dreaming.

55
00:05:58,772 --> 00:06:01,707
All I have to do is flow with it,
and I'll wake up.

56
00:06:03,276 --> 00:06:05,210
Shave.

57
00:06:05,278 --> 00:06:08,179
The sooner you shave,
the sooner you'll wake up.

58
00:06:11,718 --> 00:06:13,709
Oh, God.

59
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:17,246
It smells real.

60
00:06:17,324 --> 00:06:19,792
It feels real.

61
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,021
What the hell is happening?

62
00:06:33,473 --> 00:06:36,067
Tom?

63
00:06:36,142 --> 00:06:39,771
Honey, what's wrong? Who
do you see in the mirror?

64
00:06:39,846 --> 00:06:43,009
Oh, Tom, would you cut it out?
You nearly scared me into delivering.

65
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,244
Who do you see in the mirror?
You.

66
00:06:47,854 --> 00:06:50,015
- Me?
- And me.

67
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,853
Oh.

68
00:06:51,925 --> 00:06:54,052
Oh, I look awful.

69
00:06:54,127 --> 00:06:56,925
Most women bloom
when they get pregnant. I shrivel.

70
00:06:56,997 --> 00:06:58,931
Tom, I look like a prune.

71
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:01,627
My name's not Tom.

72
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:03,999
Honey, you're supposed to say,
"Peg, I love prunes. "

73
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:08,370
- What do you mean your name's not Tom?
- Daddy, Captain Birdell's on the phone.

74
00:07:11,011 --> 00:07:15,380
- I'm a daddy.
- Tom, are you sick?

75
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:19,316
Oh, honey, you're not gonna fly
if you're sick, are you?

76
00:07:23,056 --> 00:07:25,047
Fly?

77
00:07:26,326 --> 00:07:29,989
Mikey, tell Captain Birdell that Daddy will
call him as soon as he gets out of the shower.

78
00:07:30,063 --> 00:07:33,965
Roger. And get his number. You know
him. He never sleeps at the B. O. Q

79
00:07:35,435 --> 00:07:37,960
555-2231.

80
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:40,632
Daddy's in the shower.
What's your number?

81
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:52,577
5-5-5

82
00:07:55,722 --> 00:07:58,486
Tom, what are you up to?
I'm calling my office.

83
00:07:58,558 --> 00:08:02,324
- But that's Block field 8-4-7.
- What the hell's wrong with the phone?

84
00:08:02,395 --> 00:08:04,761
You're dialing too many numbers.

85
00:08:04,831 --> 00:08:08,028
Too many? Maybe not enough.
What's the area code?

86
00:08:08,101 --> 00:08:12,162
Area code? You never tell us
codes, Dad. That's secret stuff.

87
00:08:12,238 --> 00:08:14,263
Secret? What the hell
is secret about an area code?

88
00:08:14,341 --> 00:08:18,209
If you're testing one of your gags on us,
I don't have time for it and neither do you.

89
00:08:18,278 --> 00:08:20,678
<i>That's the morning report on KHOl. </i>

90
00:08:20,747 --> 00:08:22,977
<i>Stay tuned for all the denizens
of Doodyville... </i>

91
00:08:23,049 --> 00:08:25,813
<i>with Buffalo Bob and Howdy Doody. </i>

92
00:08:26,953 --> 00:08:30,184
<i>Well, Howdy Doody, kids. </i>

93
00:08:30,256 --> 00:08:33,817
<i>- And howdy, Buffalo Bob.
- Howdy there, Mr. Doody. </i>

94
00:08:33,893 --> 00:08:37,795
<i>Boys and girls at home and all
our kids here in the gallery, let's go!</i>

95
00:08:37,864 --> 00:08:43,870
<i>It's Howdy Doody time</i>

96
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:48,369
<i>Bob Smith and Howdy too</i>

97
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:51,501
<i>Wave howdy-do to you</i>

98
00:09:15,435 --> 00:09:17,369
Okay.

99
00:09:17,437 --> 00:09:19,371
It's not a dream.

100
00:09:19,439 --> 00:09:21,600
It's a nightmare.

101
00:09:21,675 --> 00:09:24,200
And if it's a nightmare,
sooner or later,

102
00:09:25,211 --> 00:09:27,543
there's gonna be a bogeyman.

103
00:09:30,383 --> 00:09:34,843
Until the bogeyman showed up,
I decided to ride out the dream.

104
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:37,321
Not that I had a choice.

105
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,620
Everyone seemed to think it was 1956,

106
00:09:39,693 --> 00:09:41,820
and that I was an air force
captain named Tom Stratton...

107
00:09:41,895 --> 00:09:45,956
with a wife called Peg
and one and two-thirds children.

108
00:09:46,032 --> 00:09:48,592
Evidently, my best friend
was the officer behind the wheel,

109
00:09:48,668 --> 00:09:51,603
a Captain Birdell, who
everyone simply called Bird Dog.

110
00:09:52,739 --> 00:09:55,037
It didn't take long to find out why.

111
00:09:56,476 --> 00:09:59,036
Hey. Hey-hey-hey, hoo-hoo.

112
00:09:59,112 --> 00:10:02,206
Look at this.

113
00:10:08,655 --> 00:10:11,385
Oh, my.
And I don't see a wedding ring.

114
00:10:13,593 --> 00:10:16,061
Good morning, sweet pea.
How are you?

115
00:10:17,397 --> 00:10:19,558
Allow me to introduce myself.

116
00:10:19,632 --> 00:10:22,226
I'm Captain Bill Birdell and...

117
00:10:22,302 --> 00:10:25,271
well, my facially wounded friend
here is Captain Tom Stratton.

118
00:10:26,806 --> 00:10:29,400
You might've heard of us.
We're the only two pilots...

119
00:10:29,476 --> 00:10:32,468
in the entire United States Air Force
brave enough to fly the X-2.

120
00:10:32,545 --> 00:10:34,672
Oh?

121
00:10:34,748 --> 00:10:38,844
What about Tony LaMott?
Oh, Lord.

122
00:10:38,918 --> 00:10:41,409
Don't tell me you've been led astray
by that junior birdman.

123
00:10:41,488 --> 00:10:44,321
Captain LaMott might have
a complicated wristwatch,

124
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:48,793
but he ain't anywhere close
to being otherwise test pilot equipped.

125
00:10:48,862 --> 00:10:50,796
This being Friday,
I assume you're...

126
00:10:50,864 --> 00:10:52,798
staying at the ranch
as his weekend guest?

127
00:10:52,866 --> 00:10:57,132
Well, I'm staying at the ranch.
Then I'll anticipate a dance tonight.

128
00:10:57,203 --> 00:11:01,469
And the sonic booms you hear today
will be dedicated to you.

129
00:11:25,031 --> 00:11:28,558
"Only two guys brave
enough to fly the X-2. "

130
00:11:28,635 --> 00:11:31,263
You gotta impress the ladies,
pard, if you wanna score.

131
00:11:31,337 --> 00:11:33,703
Besides that, it's true.

132
00:11:33,773 --> 00:11:35,968
What if I told you I couldn't fly?

133
00:11:36,042 --> 00:11:39,170
You sick?
No, I just...

134
00:11:39,245 --> 00:11:43,443
When I woke up this morning,
. . couldn't remember how to fly.

135
00:11:45,285 --> 00:11:48,448
I like it.
It's so crazy, I like it.

136
00:11:48,521 --> 00:11:51,012
Who you gonna pull it on?
It's not a joke.

137
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:54,287
You sound like you mean it.
I do.

138
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,797
Damn, Tom, that's what makes you
the best, that sincere look.

139
00:11:58,865 --> 00:12:03,234
Hell, if I could lie with a straight face
like you, my bird-dogging rate would double.

140
00:12:03,303 --> 00:12:06,966
Hey, what say
we pull it on Weird Ernie.

141
00:12:08,508 --> 00:12:11,875
Weird Ernie? Yeah, we'll tell him
that flying faster than Mach 2...

142
00:12:11,945 --> 00:12:13,913
is affecting our minds.

143
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,914
Affecting your minds how?

144
00:12:15,982 --> 00:12:18,473
It seems the faster I fly,
the less I remember about it.

145
00:12:18,551 --> 00:12:23,113
I've experienced that. And I'm starting
to forget things, like my wife's birthday.

146
00:12:23,189 --> 00:12:26,590
I never forgot Lucy's birthday
until I flew at Mach 2. 5.

147
00:12:26,659 --> 00:12:29,287
Last time I busted Mach 2,
I forgot where I parked my car.

148
00:12:29,362 --> 00:12:31,353
That's fascinating.

149
00:12:31,431 --> 00:12:34,525
Dr. Berger, could you design a test to
quantify these apparent memory losses?

150
00:12:35,602 --> 00:12:40,767
- I should be able to come up with something.
- Good. Good.

151
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,638
This is a most interesting development.
Thank you, gentlemen.

152
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:46,804
Before we mount up, there's one more thing.
We believe the fire warning light...

153
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,940
Captain Birdell encountered at Mach 2. 6
was a result of inadequate insulation.

154
00:12:50,016 --> 00:12:53,110
We've rewired the system,
and we expect no further problems.

155
00:12:53,186 --> 00:12:55,814
What's all this "we" stuff?
You gonna be up there with me?

156
00:12:55,889 --> 00:12:59,052
I wish I could, Captain LaMott.
I truly wish I could.

157
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:03,391
But as you know, my war wounds
physically disqualify me.

158
00:13:03,463 --> 00:13:06,921
If you should experience
a red light around Mach 2. 6,

159
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,901
shut down until the chase plane
can catch up and check you over...

160
00:13:09,969 --> 00:13:11,937
for visible signs of fire.

161
00:13:12,005 --> 00:13:13,996
A fella could
be barbecued doing that.

162
00:13:14,073 --> 00:13:16,633
You get a fire warning light, Tony,
I recommend you punch out.

163
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:21,078
- You didn't eject.
- Yeah, but I'm a damn hero.

164
00:13:21,147 --> 00:13:23,411
You know, I like that guy.

165
00:13:23,483 --> 00:13:26,008
He kind of reminds me of me
back in the old days.

166
00:13:26,085 --> 00:13:29,612
All right, all right. If there are no
further questions, gentlemen, let's mount up.

167
00:13:36,162 --> 00:13:38,528
Well, he swallowed that
hook, line and slide rule.

168
00:13:41,734 --> 00:13:44,134
Now, ain't this a kick in the butt?

169
00:13:56,649 --> 00:14:02,185
Chase One, hold on niner east.

170
00:14:07,794 --> 00:14:09,728
Mother Hen, you are cleared to roll.

171
00:14:09,796 --> 00:14:12,390
The pattern is yours.
Good luck.

172
00:14:16,636 --> 00:14:19,036
You're my best friends.
I need your honest opinion here.

173
00:14:19,105 --> 00:14:22,040
Uh-oh. Which thigh
has less stretch marks?

174
00:14:22,108 --> 00:14:24,906
Oh, Lord.
My right one. Okay?

175
00:14:24,978 --> 00:14:28,175
Or my left?
Gosh, Peg.

176
00:14:28,247 --> 00:14:30,681
You know, I think this
one has less. My right?

177
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,843
They're not as wide either.
Really?

178
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:34,750
This is the one I'm using
my cactus cream on.

179
00:14:34,821 --> 00:14:36,152
No!
Yes!

180
00:15:03,816 --> 00:15:07,616
I gotta stop drinking so much coffee.
It's making me jumpy.

181
00:15:07,687 --> 00:15:10,212
Yeah.

182
00:15:16,295 --> 00:15:19,264
Given enough time,
you can get used to anything,

183
00:15:19,332 --> 00:15:22,062
even a nightmare.

184
00:15:23,369 --> 00:15:26,998
All you have to do is relax and...

185
00:15:27,073 --> 00:15:29,064
trust those around you.

186
00:15:32,945 --> 00:15:34,879
When did you get
into the import business?

187
00:15:34,947 --> 00:15:37,415
What are you talking about?
That long-legged honey...

188
00:15:37,483 --> 00:15:39,576
staying at the ranch
this weekend.

189
00:15:39,652 --> 00:15:41,984
What's he do, Tom,
smell 'em out?

190
00:15:42,055 --> 00:15:44,250
It's a natural gift, son.
It's a natural gift.

191
00:15:44,323 --> 00:15:46,257
Sort of like
a bird dog flushing quail.

192
00:15:46,325 --> 00:15:48,793
Yeah, yeah.
Well, I gotta mount up.

193
00:16:01,941 --> 00:16:04,910
You know, I'm actually
beginning to enjoy this.

194
00:16:04,977 --> 00:16:10,074
I mean, here I am, a daring air force
test pilot who doesn't have to fly.

195
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:12,117
Well, she's all yours, pard.

196
00:16:13,586 --> 00:16:16,521
Take her up to 25 while
I answer Mother Nature.

197
00:16:45,384 --> 00:16:48,876
Mother Hen heading 2-5-0-2-6-0...

198
00:16:48,955 --> 00:16:51,480
at 12,000 and dropping.

199
00:16:51,557 --> 00:16:55,152
Mother Hen, Edwards. Radar indicates you are
in a 40-degree-per-minute turn to the right.

200
00:16:55,228 --> 00:16:57,628
Are you experiencing a problem?
Over.

201
00:17:01,901 --> 00:17:07,862
Whoa-ooo-ooo!

202
00:17:09,442 --> 00:17:12,502
- What's wrong?
- I can't fly.

203
00:17:12,578 --> 00:17:16,571
Bird Dog, Tom,
can you read me? Over.

204
00:17:22,722 --> 00:17:24,849
Mother Hen, Edwards.
Do you have a problem? Over.

205
00:17:25,925 --> 00:17:27,893
Uh, Edwards, this is Mother Hen.

206
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,894
We must've had a bubble
in the hydraulic system,

207
00:17:29,962 --> 00:17:32,931
'cause for a while, this bird
was flying like a Mack truck.

208
00:17:32,999 --> 00:17:34,990
Whatever it was,
we must have burped it out.

209
00:17:35,067 --> 00:17:38,332
We are continuing our climb
up to 25,000.

210
00:17:39,972 --> 00:17:43,601
You save it for Weird Ernie, pard.
You ain't never gonna sucker me.

211
00:17:46,946 --> 00:17:48,937
Just don't ask me to fly.

212
00:18:21,981 --> 00:18:25,314
<i>Edwards, Mother Hen.
Level at 25,000. </i>

213
00:18:25,384 --> 00:18:27,648
Roger, Mother Hen.
You are clear to drop.

214
00:18:29,989 --> 00:18:31,980
Good luck.

215
00:18:42,902 --> 00:18:45,769
Hey, Tony, I'm tired of
hauling your butt around.

216
00:18:45,838 --> 00:18:50,070
I'm gonna cut you loose and see which
of us gets back to that blonde first.

217
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:01,086
Is everybody back there
okay where they're at?

218
00:19:03,556 --> 00:19:05,922
Yeah, looks fine to me.

219
00:19:07,226 --> 00:19:12,129
All right. 240 indicated.
Here we go, ladies.

220
00:19:13,366 --> 00:19:16,995
Drop in ten, nine, eight,

221
00:19:17,069 --> 00:19:19,503
seven, six,

222
00:19:19,572 --> 00:19:21,472
five, four,

223
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,509
three, two,

224
00:19:24,577 --> 00:19:26,272
one.

225
00:19:26,345 --> 00:19:27,972
Bombs away.

226
00:19:52,805 --> 00:19:55,239
Ride her, cowboy.

227
00:20:05,584 --> 00:20:09,418
Mach 1. 3 and accelerating.

228
00:20:10,423 --> 00:20:12,084
Nosing over.

229
00:20:14,293 --> 00:20:17,820
One-nine. Mach 2.

230
00:20:19,065 --> 00:20:21,863
All right.
She's leveling off.

231
00:20:21,934 --> 00:20:24,869
65,000.

232
00:20:24,937 --> 00:20:27,098
Sixty-six.

233
00:20:27,173 --> 00:20:30,336
Level at 71,000.

234
00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:33,105
Mach 2. 4.

235
00:20:34,947 --> 00:20:36,938
On profile.

236
00:20:39,285 --> 00:20:43,051
All right. Starting my run.
Firing rocket three.

237
00:20:43,122 --> 00:20:46,353
Mach 2. 5.

238
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,260
Two-six.

239
00:20:53,199 --> 00:20:57,192
Outside skin temperature. 683.

240
00:20:57,269 --> 00:20:59,396
Ain't no fire warning light.

241
00:20:59,472 --> 00:21:02,066
I guess we beat that gremlin.

242
00:21:03,709 --> 00:21:05,643
Mach 2. 7.

243
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:10,647
Two-eight.

244
00:21:14,687 --> 00:21:17,781
Skin temperature. 800.

245
00:21:20,292 --> 00:21:22,419
Fire warning light.

246
00:21:23,462 --> 00:21:26,090
Rockets off.

247
00:21:32,571 --> 00:21:35,096
Everything looks okay.
Mach 2. 4.

248
00:21:35,174 --> 00:21:36,835
2. 3.

249
00:21:37,843 --> 00:21:40,141
Nah, I think it's
another false alarm.

250
00:21:40,212 --> 00:21:44,410
- Hey, where are you, Dougie?
- Five miles behind you at 30,000.

251
00:21:44,483 --> 00:21:47,145
Roger. Coming back to you
for a look-see.

252
00:21:47,987 --> 00:21:51,081
Don't turn above Mach 2.
Don't turn above Mach 2.

253
00:21:51,157 --> 00:21:53,318
Oh, I lost her!

254
00:22:33,532 --> 00:22:35,523
Did you see it?

255
00:22:38,204 --> 00:22:40,195
There.

256
00:22:42,374 --> 00:22:44,365
Oh, God.

257
00:23:21,947 --> 00:23:24,609
Well, the X-2 didn't get him,
but she's sure gonna auger him in.

258
00:23:24,683 --> 00:23:30,349
- You think so?
- Yeah, he's got that, uh, that sick calf look.

259
00:23:30,422 --> 00:23:33,653
Here we go, gang.
Bird Dog's about to pounce.

260
00:23:33,726 --> 00:23:36,058
Shoot, he's the only pilot left
in the B. O. Q

261
00:23:36,128 --> 00:23:38,596
Be awful lonesome in there
without him.

262
00:23:38,664 --> 00:23:41,497
How would you know?
You never sleep in the B. O. Q

263
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:15,698
As nightmares go, this one is definitely
taking a turn for the better.

264
00:24:16,702 --> 00:24:21,696
Even at six months, I found Peg...
stunningly beautiful.

265
00:24:21,774 --> 00:24:24,038
Although, I doubt she'd believe it.

266
00:24:24,109 --> 00:24:28,136
It could be that pregnant women hold
some strange attraction for me, but...

267
00:24:28,213 --> 00:24:30,408
I think it's Peg.

268
00:24:30,482 --> 00:24:33,508
Whatever it is, the chemistry
is definitely working and,

269
00:24:33,586 --> 00:24:35,747
well, I'll just have to
keep telling myself...

270
00:24:35,821 --> 00:24:38,085
I'm not really her husband, Tom.

271
00:24:42,027 --> 00:24:44,018
Would you like to dance?

272
00:24:44,096 --> 00:24:45,654
What?
Dance.

273
00:24:47,232 --> 00:24:50,258
With this stomach?
I can reach around it.

274
00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:34,037
Well, I wanna know who you've
been dancing with, mister.

275
00:25:34,113 --> 00:25:37,105
What? Tom, you may be the
best pilot in the air force,

276
00:25:37,182 --> 00:25:41,380
but you were born
with two left feet... until tonight.

277
00:25:41,453 --> 00:25:45,253
Maybe I just needed
a well-rounded partner.

278
00:25:56,268 --> 00:25:58,259
Peg?
Hmm?

279
00:25:59,371 --> 00:26:01,532
Who's that guy
by the jukebox?

280
00:26:03,575 --> 00:26:05,600
That's Doug.

281
00:26:05,678 --> 00:26:08,442
No, no, no.
The guy in the tux.

282
00:26:08,514 --> 00:26:11,005
A tux? In here?

283
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,647
You don't see a man in a black tux
standing by the jukebox?

284
00:26:18,724 --> 00:26:21,090
Tom, Tom.

285
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,220
Everything is so nice.
Let's not spoil it.

286
00:26:24,296 --> 00:26:27,197
Either someone blocked Peg's view
of the guy in the tux,

287
00:26:27,266 --> 00:26:30,758
or the bogeyman had arrived.

288
00:26:30,836 --> 00:26:33,930
Whichever it was,
I was going to find out.

289
00:26:34,006 --> 00:26:36,736
Oh, Tom. No, you're
six months along, Peg.

290
00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:39,209
At six months, you dance one,
and then sit one out.

291
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:42,213
Doctor's orders.
But I feel fine,

292
00:26:42,281 --> 00:26:44,749
and we never get
a chance to dance.

293
00:26:44,817 --> 00:26:48,913
This is my favorite song.
I don't want you to overdo it.

294
00:26:48,987 --> 00:26:51,581
Look, we've got
all night, okay?

295
00:26:51,657 --> 00:26:53,318
Okay.

296
00:26:53,392 --> 00:26:55,758
I'm gonna go feed the old
jukebox. I'll be right back.

297
00:27:13,812 --> 00:27:17,145
Isn't this great?

298
00:27:17,216 --> 00:27:19,150
I mean, isn't this just great?

299
00:27:19,218 --> 00:27:21,448
Brings back so many old memories.

300
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,080
Hey, have they got
"Be-Bop-A-Lula" on there?

301
00:27:24,156 --> 00:27:28,149
Got me through some long,
cold nights at M. I. T.

302
00:27:28,227 --> 00:27:33,665
"Be-Bop" and a little
Lithuanian girl named Danesa.

303
00:27:33,732 --> 00:27:35,700
She was in the chemistry lab
researching the...

304
00:27:35,768 --> 00:27:38,032
Am I dead?
What?

305
00:27:38,103 --> 00:27:40,162
Dead. Am I dead?
It would explain a lot.

306
00:27:40,239 --> 00:27:43,231
I could be in a reverse reincarnation
that's entered in midlife.

307
00:27:43,308 --> 00:27:49,042
That's a good one, Sam.
You know my name.

308
00:27:49,114 --> 00:27:51,105
I'm not that wasted.

309
00:27:51,183 --> 00:27:53,378
Why do you know who I am
when no one else does?

310
00:27:53,452 --> 00:27:57,013
Are you serious? Dead
serious. No pun intended.

311
00:27:59,892 --> 00:28:02,122
Oh, my God.

312
00:28:02,194 --> 00:28:05,755
You really don't
recognize me, do you? No.

313
00:28:05,831 --> 00:28:08,698
Or remember the experiment.
What experiment?

314
00:28:08,767 --> 00:28:11,531
What do you remember
prior to waking up this morning?

315
00:28:11,603 --> 00:28:15,505
Other than my name and a telephone
number, not a lot. What experiment?

316
00:28:15,574 --> 00:28:18,975
If I'm part of an experiment, then this
all isn't a psychotic hallucination, is it?

317
00:28:19,044 --> 00:28:21,035
Is it?

318
00:28:22,414 --> 00:28:26,817
Oh, God,
that putz Ziggy was right.

319
00:28:26,885 --> 00:28:30,412
Ziggy? I remember a Ziggy.
A little guy with bad breath.

320
00:28:30,489 --> 00:28:32,480
You're slipping; pard.

321
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:36,016
Nobody's gonna fall for that old
"talking to somebody who ain't there" gag.

322
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:58,678
Oh, God. What the hell?

323
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:01,742
What are we gonna do?

324
00:29:02,888 --> 00:29:07,757
- We're in a rotten fix.
I told him not to...

325
00:29:09,461 --> 00:29:12,521
Though I don't know

326
00:29:12,598 --> 00:29:15,692
Many words of praise

327
00:29:15,767 --> 00:29:17,758
Please, God,

328
00:29:19,504 --> 00:29:22,064
I'd like to wake up now.

329
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:27,772
Put on your bonnet
your cape and your glove

330
00:29:27,846 --> 00:29:31,179
And come with me

331
00:29:33,051 --> 00:29:35,781
This is KCV530, Victorville.

332
00:29:35,854 --> 00:29:40,587
Here's Velton Bunch
and the Dovetones.

333
00:29:40,659 --> 00:29:43,423
I never realized how hard it was
to follow a road without striping.

334
00:29:44,496 --> 00:29:46,726
Striping?

335
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:48,732
I was just thinking that,
you know,

336
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,291
if they would paint white stripes
along the side of the road,

337
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,361
it would be easier to see.

338
00:29:54,673 --> 00:29:56,607
That's a very good idea, Tom.

339
00:29:56,675 --> 00:29:59,576
I got a few of them.

340
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,975
Tonight was fun.

341
00:30:08,053 --> 00:30:10,487
Good.

342
00:30:10,555 --> 00:30:13,353
It was a little scary too.
Why scary?

343
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:17,522
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe because...

344
00:30:17,596 --> 00:30:19,587
you wanted to dance.

345
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,290
It's not the first time
we danced.

346
00:30:23,368 --> 00:30:26,360
And you didn't drink more
than one or two beers...

347
00:30:26,438 --> 00:30:28,838
or talk flying.

348
00:30:28,907 --> 00:30:30,898
I can't remember
the last time you sat...

349
00:30:30,976 --> 00:30:33,308
at a table full of pilots
and you didn't talk airplanes.

350
00:30:33,378 --> 00:30:35,312
It seemed to me that's
all we talked about.

351
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,314
That's all they talked about.
You didn't say a word.

352
00:30:37,382 --> 00:30:41,512
I wasn't in a talkative mood.
You were at the jukebox.

353
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:51,018
"Why is it... "
"When you... "

354
00:30:52,064 --> 00:30:55,830
"Try to pass... "
"The guy in front... "

355
00:30:57,069 --> 00:31:01,028
- "Goes twice as fast?"
- "Burma Shave. "

356
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:07,704
Oh, it feels nice.

357
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:11,044
How did it work?
Better than my electric razor,

358
00:31:11,116 --> 00:31:13,107
uh, would.

359
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:18,082
I don't use an electric razor, do I? No.

360
00:31:18,156 --> 00:31:20,420
No, Tom.

361
00:31:20,492 --> 00:31:23,427
What's going on?
I wish I knew.

362
00:31:23,495 --> 00:31:28,091
- Honey, just tell me, okay?
- What if I told you my name wasn't Tom?

363
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:30,726
You said that this morning
in the bathroom. It's Sam.

364
00:31:30,802 --> 00:31:34,898
Don't ask me what my last name is
because I can't remember it.

365
00:31:34,973 --> 00:31:37,498
I look in a mirror, and I see...

366
00:31:37,576 --> 00:31:39,510
Tom Stratton, I guess,

367
00:31:39,578 --> 00:31:42,012
but he's not me.

368
00:31:43,015 --> 00:31:44,949
I can't fly.

369
00:31:45,017 --> 00:31:47,008
In fact,
I don't know what I can do.

370
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:51,350
When I woke up this morning,

371
00:31:51,423 --> 00:31:55,757
I didn't know you or Mikey...
or anyone else at the base.

372
00:31:57,496 --> 00:32:00,021
I know it sounds like I belong
in a loony bin, but it's the truth.

373
00:32:00,098 --> 00:32:03,727
The reason I'm acting different
is because I am different.

374
00:32:03,802 --> 00:32:08,466
- I'm not your Tom.
- Oh, Tom.

375
00:32:10,642 --> 00:32:12,132
Oh, look.

376
00:32:13,845 --> 00:32:16,973
Please don't...
Then stop doing this, okay?

377
00:32:17,049 --> 00:32:19,711
You asked me to explain...
Just stop it, Tom.

378
00:32:28,527 --> 00:32:30,518
I'm sorry, Peg.

379
00:32:31,696 --> 00:32:34,688
I'm being a real nerd.

380
00:32:34,766 --> 00:32:36,757
You were right.
I'm setting up a gag.

381
00:32:36,835 --> 00:32:40,965
- Thank God.
- I shouldn't have tried it on you.

382
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,769
Oh, honey, you had me
scared to death.

383
00:32:43,842 --> 00:32:46,208
I thought you had a brain tumor
or something.

384
00:32:46,278 --> 00:32:48,746
I never thought of that.
What?

385
00:32:50,715 --> 00:32:53,809
Bird Dog and I have been dreaming up
theories to explain why I can't fly.

386
00:32:53,885 --> 00:32:55,819
You see, that's the joke.

387
00:32:55,887 --> 00:32:58,447
I tell Weird Ernie
that I forgot how to fly.

388
00:32:58,523 --> 00:33:01,549
You tell Weird Ernie that
you forgot how to fly. Yeah.

389
00:33:01,626 --> 00:33:04,151
Tom, that is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

390
00:33:04,229 --> 00:33:08,188
I don't know.
It sounds pretty plausible to me.

391
00:33:13,405 --> 00:33:15,737
Tom?
Hmm?

392
00:33:15,807 --> 00:33:17,798
What's a nerd?

393
00:33:20,645 --> 00:33:22,476
Well, it, uh...

394
00:34:14,332 --> 00:34:16,766
What's the matter?

395
00:34:16,835 --> 00:34:19,929
What? Nothing. Go back to sleep.

396
00:34:20,005 --> 00:34:21,996
Okay.

397
00:34:26,111 --> 00:34:28,739
That's all I need,
a good night's sleep.

398
00:34:28,813 --> 00:34:31,008
I'll figure it out in the morning
when I milk the cows.

399
00:34:32,017 --> 00:34:34,008
"Milk the cows"?

400
00:34:36,054 --> 00:34:40,115
I was raised
on a dairy farm in Indiana...

401
00:34:40,192 --> 00:34:42,319
until I was 18.

402
00:34:42,394 --> 00:34:44,385
I went to college at...

403
00:34:46,231 --> 00:34:49,689
Damn, I can't remember.
Stick to the farm.

404
00:34:49,768 --> 00:34:53,761
I was raised on a farm with...
my sister Kate.

405
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:56,068
Katie married a naval officer.

406
00:34:56,141 --> 00:34:58,439
Um, Lieutenant John...

407
00:34:59,444 --> 00:35:02,641
No, Jim.
Jim Bonick.

408
00:35:02,714 --> 00:35:04,978
Yeah, Katie and Jim Bonick.

409
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:07,712
Mom's lived with them in Hawaii
ever since...

410
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,645
Dad died in '74.

411
00:35:15,193 --> 00:35:17,184
But this is '56.

412
00:35:21,233 --> 00:35:23,895
My dad is still alive.

413
00:35:33,812 --> 00:35:35,803
Operator.

414
00:35:37,549 --> 00:35:40,848
Operator,
I'd like long distance, please.

415
00:35:40,919 --> 00:35:42,910
Long Distance.

416
00:35:45,457 --> 00:35:47,448
Indiana, please.

417
00:35:49,761 --> 00:35:52,924
Elk Ridge, Indiana.
Number, please.

418
00:35:55,834 --> 00:35:57,893
Number, please.

419
00:35:57,969 --> 00:36:00,699
I'm-I'm-I'm trying, Operator,
but it's been a long time.

420
00:36:00,772 --> 00:36:03,332
Um, it's...

421
00:36:06,144 --> 00:36:08,078
Oakdell.

422
00:36:08,146 --> 00:36:11,604
Yeah, that's it.
Uh, Oakdell...

423
00:36:11,683 --> 00:36:14,550
Sir, why don't you give me
the name of the party,

424
00:36:14,619 --> 00:36:17,452
and I will ring
Elk Ridge Information.

425
00:36:19,457 --> 00:36:21,550
Sir?

426
00:36:21,626 --> 00:36:24,527
Sir, do you want
Elk Ridge Information?

427
00:36:30,969 --> 00:36:34,996
Dad? What's wrong?

428
00:36:35,073 --> 00:36:37,541
I'm just...
I'm catching a cold.

429
00:36:37,609 --> 00:36:39,600
Wanna skip the fishing trip?

430
00:36:40,912 --> 00:36:43,005
- What?
- It's Saturday.

431
00:36:43,081 --> 00:36:45,015
You said we'd go fishing today.

432
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:48,018
But we don't have to
if you don't feel good.

433
00:36:49,287 --> 00:36:51,278
What are you talking about?

434
00:36:51,356 --> 00:36:54,086
Nothing cures a cold
faster than a fishing trip.

435
00:37:14,412 --> 00:37:16,403
You don't wanna do that.

436
00:37:16,481 --> 00:37:19,109
I just did that to show you
what not to do.

437
00:37:20,118 --> 00:37:23,781
I'll bring it back now, and I'll
show you how it should be done.

438
00:37:28,293 --> 00:37:32,320
Now, remember, Mikey,
even your best fly fisherman...

439
00:37:32,397 --> 00:37:34,524
gets his fly snagged now and then.

440
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:39,036
But it's the old pro
who can bring it back without...

441
00:37:39,104 --> 00:37:41,095
Can I try now, Dad?

442
00:37:50,215 --> 00:37:52,376
You stay here and fish this,
uh, pool, all right?

443
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:55,214
I'm gonna fish further upstream. Roger.

444
00:37:56,221 --> 00:37:59,987
Dad, I know you're trying
to make me look good.

445
00:38:02,961 --> 00:38:04,952
Yeah.

446
00:38:25,984 --> 00:38:28,680
Is that a Ginger Quill
spent wing?

447
00:38:28,753 --> 00:38:31,847
Or maybe a Blue Dunn?
I don't know.

448
00:38:31,923 --> 00:38:35,017
I got such a damn hangover.
It could be a Coors pop-top.

449
00:38:37,729 --> 00:38:41,665
Don't yell, please!

450
00:38:41,733 --> 00:38:44,293
I should've stayed in bed
with Tina.

451
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:47,600
You still don't
remember me, huh?

452
00:38:47,672 --> 00:38:49,663
That's sad, pal, very sad.

453
00:38:49,741 --> 00:38:51,675
My name is Albert.

454
00:38:51,743 --> 00:38:54,610
Albert what, I can't tell you,
because it's restricted.

455
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:57,512
Most of what you're gonna
wanna know is restricted.

456
00:38:57,582 --> 00:39:00,608
So it'll be easier for us if you
don't ask a lot of questions.

457
00:39:00,685 --> 00:39:03,347
- What are you?
- That's a question, Sam.

458
00:39:04,422 --> 00:39:06,982
I'm a man, like you.

459
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,785
Mmm.

460
00:39:13,498 --> 00:39:17,059
- Not like me.
- Oh, no, uh, this isn't me.

461
00:39:17,135 --> 00:39:19,865
This is, uh,
a neurological hologram.

462
00:39:19,938 --> 00:39:22,964
It's an image that only
you can see and hear.

463
00:39:23,041 --> 00:39:25,202
Created by a subatomic
agitation of carbon quarks...

464
00:39:25,276 --> 00:39:28,040
... tuned to the mesons
of my optic and optic neurons?

465
00:39:28,112 --> 00:39:32,014
- You got it.
- How did I know that?

466
00:39:34,652 --> 00:39:37,788
Ziggy has come up with five
different scenarios to ex...

467
00:39:37,789 --> 00:39:38,588
Ziggy!

468
00:39:38,656 --> 00:39:41,609
Ziggy, a little guy with bad breath.

469
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:42,820
No, that's Gooshie.

470
00:39:42,894 --> 00:39:45,829
He programs Ziggy.
Ziggy's a hybrid computer.

471
00:39:45,897 --> 00:39:50,095
Hybrid computers and neurological
holograms didn't exist in 1956.

472
00:39:50,168 --> 00:39:52,693
Only in theory.
But this is '56.

473
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:55,500
Well, it is for you.
It is not for me.

474
00:39:55,573 --> 00:39:57,507
What's my last name?

475
00:39:57,575 --> 00:39:59,873
If you can't remember, I
can't tell you. It's important.

476
00:39:59,944 --> 00:40:03,175
But it's also on top of Ziggy's
no-no list, double-starred.

477
00:40:03,248 --> 00:40:05,182
Why?
I can't tell you that either.

478
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,184
What the hell can you tell me?

479
00:40:07,252 --> 00:40:09,982
Basically, what you already know.

480
00:40:10,054 --> 00:40:14,013
that you're, uh, part of
a time-travel experiment...

481
00:40:14,092 --> 00:40:16,083
that went a little caca.

482
00:40:17,462 --> 00:40:19,453
"A little caca"?

483
00:40:20,798 --> 00:40:24,461
- How little caca?
- Well, you're here, which is a biggie.

484
00:40:24,536 --> 00:40:26,629
I mean, that's a first.
It's Nobel Prize time.

485
00:40:26,704 --> 00:40:28,638
You should be proud of that.
And?

486
00:40:28,706 --> 00:40:31,573
And, uh, uh,
we're experiencing...

487
00:40:31,643 --> 00:40:34,806
technical difficulties in,
uh, retrieving you.

488
00:40:37,749 --> 00:40:39,910
That's great, Al.

489
00:40:41,286 --> 00:40:43,220
I wake up in '56 with a memory
like Swiss cheese,

490
00:40:43,288 --> 00:40:45,313
and you're experiencing
technical difficulties?

491
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:48,223
Whose brainchild is this, yours?

492
00:40:49,227 --> 00:40:52,094
No, not mine.

493
00:40:52,163 --> 00:40:55,530
I haven't got a lot of time. I have
to find out which of these scenarios...

494
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,592
can explain why we couldn't
retrieve you this morning.

495
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:01,468
You tried? Of course we
tried. You wouldn't leap.

496
00:41:01,539 --> 00:41:03,666
So now it's my fault.
Possibly.

497
00:41:03,741 --> 00:41:06,767
Did you tell anyone
that you're not Tom Stratton?

498
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,314
Sort of.
Oh, Sam.

499
00:41:11,382 --> 00:41:13,976
Retrieving you is dependent upon
everyone here...

500
00:41:14,052 --> 00:41:16,145
believing that you're
the person you replaced.

501
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:19,348
They didn't believe me. I look in
a mirror, and I don't believe me.

502
00:41:19,424 --> 00:41:23,190
That's to be expected.
To us, Tom looks just like you.

503
00:41:24,596 --> 00:41:26,530
He's with you?
Of course.

504
00:41:26,598 --> 00:41:29,761
How do you think we located you?
When you went in, he came out.

505
00:41:29,834 --> 00:41:33,361
If it's any consolation,
his memory is full of holes too.

506
00:41:33,438 --> 00:41:36,999
Now, everyone has to believe
that you're Tom Stratton...

507
00:41:37,075 --> 00:41:39,669
if we're gonna be able
to retrieve you on Tuesday.

508
00:41:39,744 --> 00:41:41,871
Tuesday.

509
00:41:43,114 --> 00:41:45,708
Tuesday's gonna be a little late.

510
00:41:45,783 --> 00:41:48,581
I'm, uh...

511
00:41:48,653 --> 00:41:52,089
I'm scheduled to test-fly
the X-2 on Monday.

512
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,651
Did you ever think
of taking flying lessons?

513
00:42:01,099 --> 00:42:03,090
Just a thought.

514
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:15,040
All right, give me the big one.
Right down the middle.

515
00:42:17,482 --> 00:42:19,882
Not bad, not bad. Right in
the glove. Right in the glove.

516
00:42:19,951 --> 00:42:23,443
Right down the middle. No batter,
no batter, no batter, no batter.

517
00:42:23,521 --> 00:42:26,046
What you need
is a little Texas sauce.

518
00:42:26,124 --> 00:42:29,719
Yeah! Ow. Mmm.

519
00:42:29,794 --> 00:42:33,355
How does he do it?
Probably wearing his hat.

520
00:42:37,335 --> 00:42:40,498
Sometimes Doug
wears his goggles.

521
00:42:42,006 --> 00:42:44,668
Well, I think it's sexy.

522
00:42:44,742 --> 00:42:48,007
I mean, if anything,
that spin became even flatter.

523
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:50,604
Hi, baby.

524
00:42:50,682 --> 00:42:54,550
I mean, I didn't want to punch out
inverted, but what the hell else could I do?

525
00:42:57,622 --> 00:43:01,080
All right.

526
00:43:30,121 --> 00:43:33,249
Yeah!

527
00:43:33,324 --> 00:43:34,951
Wow!

528
00:43:35,026 --> 00:43:38,484
Did you see that roll and flip
he did at the top, Dad?

529
00:43:38,563 --> 00:43:41,498
What do you call it?
You got me.

530
00:43:44,469 --> 00:43:47,905
- The chandelle, Mikey.
- Wow! It sure was something.

531
00:43:48,906 --> 00:43:52,933
Yeah, it sure was.

532
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:55,808
I'd better help your mom.

533
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,973
Aw, Dad.
Unless you wanna set the table.

534
00:43:58,049 --> 00:44:00,142
Hey, Captain Crawford,
wanna play catch?

535
00:44:00,218 --> 00:44:02,584
Sure do.
Fire one on in there, Mikey.

536
00:44:14,198 --> 00:44:16,189
Hi.
Hi.

537
00:44:20,438 --> 00:44:22,565
You okay?
I'm fine.

538
00:44:23,941 --> 00:44:27,308
You look a little pale.
Yeah, well, it's the heat.

539
00:44:27,378 --> 00:44:29,312
I'll never get used to it.

540
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:32,281
You want me to help?
I make a mean Caesar salad.

541
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:34,978
I'm just kidding.
I know.

542
00:44:35,987 --> 00:44:38,182
But not about how you look.

543
00:44:38,256 --> 00:44:40,247
Well, that's your fault.

544
00:44:41,659 --> 00:44:44,253
That's not what I meant.
Look, I'm fine.

545
00:44:44,328 --> 00:44:46,262
I really am.

546
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:49,458
Why don't you just go back
on out there with Mikey?

547
00:44:49,534 --> 00:44:53,971
You know, you haven't spent this much
time with him since he was hit by the bus.

548
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,231
Okay.

549
00:45:00,211 --> 00:45:03,180
Hey, flyboy.

550
00:45:22,466 --> 00:45:25,128
Come and get it.
Uh...

551
00:45:25,203 --> 00:45:27,467
Got to eat trout
while it's sizzling.

552
00:45:27,538 --> 00:45:29,506
Yeah.

553
00:45:29,574 --> 00:45:32,941
Why don't you take the salad out?
I'll get the rolls.

554
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:35,035
Yeah.

555
00:45:50,494 --> 00:45:52,092
I'm sorry to pull you
from your barbecue,

556
00:45:52,093 --> 00:45:54,260
but Dr. Berger and I have just
finished a questionnaire...

557
00:45:54,332 --> 00:45:58,200
to test Captain Birdell's theory that Mach
3 flight has a negative effect on the memory.

558
00:45:58,269 --> 00:46:00,931
Quite frankly, if this theory had
come from you, I'd be skeptical.

559
00:46:01,005 --> 00:46:04,497
We all know your penchant
for practical jokes, eh?

560
00:46:04,575 --> 00:46:07,408
Doctor, any memory loss
I suffer won't be faked.

561
00:46:07,478 --> 00:46:09,844
We're going to call it the
Ernst-Berger Engramic Standard.

562
00:46:09,914 --> 00:46:14,112
200 questions designed to
benchmark a person's memory.

563
00:46:14,185 --> 00:46:17,120
I thought we were gonna call it
the Berger-Ernst Engramic Standard.

564
00:46:17,188 --> 00:46:18,655
Hi, Tom.
Hi.

565
00:46:18,723 --> 00:46:21,658
These questions should give us
a cross section of your memory.

566
00:46:21,726 --> 00:46:25,628
Some, like your age, place of birth,
are the usual statistics.

567
00:46:25,696 --> 00:46:29,188
But I think you'll find
most are rather unusual.

568
00:46:29,267 --> 00:46:32,065
What was the coldest
you've ever been?

569
00:46:32,136 --> 00:46:34,127
Who was your second-best friend
in college?

570
00:46:35,373 --> 00:46:37,307
Where did you first make love?

571
00:46:39,277 --> 00:46:41,438
Well, at least you didn't ask to who.

572
00:46:41,512 --> 00:46:43,605
Dr. Ernst suggested that,

573
00:46:43,681 --> 00:46:46,946
but where is as meaningful
and more discreet.

574
00:46:47,018 --> 00:46:49,009
Sort of a personal "Trivial Pursuit"?

575
00:46:50,922 --> 00:46:52,856
Not a bad name.

576
00:46:52,924 --> 00:46:55,154
The Berger-Ernst
Engramic Trivial Pursuit.

577
00:46:55,226 --> 00:46:58,957
Ernst-Berger. We'll need this filled
out before you take off on Monday.

578
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:00,964
You'll fill it out
again when you land.

579
00:47:01,032 --> 00:47:04,297
If there are any significant changes in your
memory, we should be able to detect them.

580
00:47:04,368 --> 00:47:07,064
- Any questions, Captain?
- Uh, no, no.

581
00:47:07,138 --> 00:47:11,302
It seems simple enough. I’ll, hum...
I'll have it for you on Monday.

582
00:47:12,476 --> 00:47:14,467
Doctors.

583
00:47:21,152 --> 00:47:24,644
Doctor, we could be on the verge
of a momentous discovery.

584
00:47:24,722 --> 00:47:28,624
Or the butt of a momentous joke.

585
00:48:06,931 --> 00:48:10,526
Pretty simple, huh?

586
00:48:10,601 --> 00:48:12,432
Can't you just
fade in or something?

587
00:48:12,503 --> 00:48:17,065
You tell me how to fade in agitated carbon
quarks, and I'll make the Scientific Journal.

588
00:48:17,141 --> 00:48:21,976
Just don't sneak up on me. You
still don't remember our project?

589
00:48:22,046 --> 00:48:26,779
Bad enough I have to give Dick-and-Jane
explanations to the president.

590
00:48:26,851 --> 00:48:30,343
I've gotta give you one too.
All right.

591
00:48:30,421 --> 00:48:33,822
One end of this string
represents your birth.

592
00:48:33,891 --> 00:48:39,488
The other end, your death. You tie the
ends together, and your life is a loop.

593
00:48:39,563 --> 00:48:42,191
Ball the loop...

594
00:48:43,801 --> 00:48:47,464
and the days of your life
touch each other out of sequence.

595
00:48:47,538 --> 00:48:50,530
Therefore, leaping from one point
of the string to another...

596
00:48:50,608 --> 00:48:53,008
Would move you backward or forward
within your own lifetime.

597
00:48:53,077 --> 00:48:55,739
Which is our project,
Quantum Leap!

598
00:48:57,581 --> 00:48:59,515
I can't remember.

599
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,182
Al! I wish you would stop doing that.

600
00:49:05,256 --> 00:49:07,315
What?

601
00:49:07,391 --> 00:49:09,723
Walking through things.

602
00:49:09,794 --> 00:49:14,595
Well, you want me to walk around something that
isn't even here? All right, I'll walk around it.

603
00:49:14,665 --> 00:49:18,692
There. How's that?
Why- Why isn't it here?

604
00:49:18,769 --> 00:49:23,832
I'm a hologram to you, right? Well, you and
everything around you is a hologram to me.

605
00:49:23,908 --> 00:49:27,105
You're in the imaging
chamber. You remember.

606
00:49:27,178 --> 00:49:29,738
Vaguely. A cavern somewhere. New Mexico.

607
00:49:29,814 --> 00:49:32,305
What year is it there?

608
00:49:32,383 --> 00:49:36,217
You'll find that out...
if we get you back. If?

609
00:49:36,287 --> 00:49:39,051
Well, see, Ziggy's theory is really...
It's a load of crap.

610
00:49:39,123 --> 00:49:43,082
I mean, you gotta believe
that God or time or something...

611
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:47,494
was just waiting for
your quantum leap to, uh,

612
00:49:47,565 --> 00:49:51,023
to correct a mistake.
A mistake in time?

613
00:49:51,102 --> 00:49:54,697
Something that happened in the life
of Captain Tom Stratton in '56,

614
00:49:54,772 --> 00:49:57,036
since he's the one you bounced out.

615
00:49:57,108 --> 00:50:01,135
Once that's put right,
you'll snap back like a pimp's suspenders.

616
00:50:01,212 --> 00:50:02,679
Once what's put right?

617
00:50:02,746 --> 00:50:07,206
Tom Stratton was killed
trying to break Mach 3 in the X-2.

618
00:50:07,284 --> 00:50:12,153
If Ziggy's right,
all you have to do is break Mach 3...

619
00:50:12,223 --> 00:50:13,747
and live.

620
00:50:19,597 --> 00:50:21,531
Hey!
No way.

621
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:23,999
Hey, pal, it's not my theory.
There's gotta be another way.

622
00:50:24,068 --> 00:50:26,366
The next one's only got
a 52% chance of working.

623
00:50:26,437 --> 00:50:28,371
I'll take it.

624
00:50:28,439 --> 00:50:31,772
It requires you to be at ground zero
during an atomic detonation.

625
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:36,002
You asked.
What else have you got?

626
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:39,481
This isn't a shopping list, you know.

627
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:41,950
The odds drop into
the low teens after that.

628
00:50:42,019 --> 00:50:47,184
Your best shot is freezing the brain
until all electrical activity has ceased.

629
00:50:47,258 --> 00:50:50,694
That's called death.
I never said it would be easy.

630
00:50:52,163 --> 00:50:55,098
Hey, slow down, will ya?
I'm fighting a hangover.

631
00:50:55,166 --> 00:50:57,691
All right, you want a sure thing?
I got it for you.

632
00:50:57,768 --> 00:51:01,295
You don't do anything. You just live.
Barring accidental death...

633
00:51:01,372 --> 00:51:04,068
or a fatal disease,
you'll be back in 40 years.

634
00:51:04,141 --> 00:51:07,110
That's your safest option.
And Tom Stratton?

635
00:51:07,178 --> 00:51:09,806
He'll go on living forward
from where he's at now.

636
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:13,976
Technically, he could end up
the oldest man alive.

637
00:51:14,051 --> 00:51:18,215
Well, what about Peg and Mikey? I don't want to
hurt them, but I can't go on pretending I'm Tom.

638
00:51:18,289 --> 00:51:21,656
Hey, they were gonna
lose him on Monday anyway.

639
00:51:21,725 --> 00:51:25,058
Of course,
if you bust Mach 3 and survive,

640
00:51:25,129 --> 00:51:28,257
they could have him around for
another 30 or 40 years. I can't fly!

641
00:51:28,332 --> 00:51:30,266
I'll be your copilot.
You're a hologram.

642
00:51:30,334 --> 00:51:34,293
I'm also an ex-astronaut. The hardest part
about flying is taking off and landing.

643
00:51:34,371 --> 00:51:38,740
The B-50 does the first part for you.
After that, you just fire a couple of rockets,

644
00:51:38,809 --> 00:51:41,972
hang on to the stick
and ka-za-zoom, Mach 3.

645
00:51:42,046 --> 00:51:44,640
And the second part?
Landing?

646
00:51:46,083 --> 00:51:50,611
You could never land the X-2, not
even with my help. So, you don't.

647
00:51:50,688 --> 00:51:53,486
I eject?
Mmm.

648
00:51:53,557 --> 00:51:56,788
X-2 does a crash and burn.
You float back to earth on a pillow of silk.

649
00:51:56,860 --> 00:52:00,591
The moment you touch down, you leap forward,
Tom leaps back, and the broad and I...

650
00:52:00,664 --> 00:52:02,996
are gone to Las Vegas.
It might work.

651
00:52:03,067 --> 00:52:05,001
Of course it'll work.

652
00:52:05,069 --> 00:52:07,435
A minute ago
you said it was crap.

653
00:52:10,674 --> 00:52:13,165
That was before I thought it out.

654
00:52:56,553 --> 00:52:59,021
Tom?

655
00:52:59,089 --> 00:53:02,547
You should be asleep.
And you shouldn't be?

656
00:53:09,433 --> 00:53:11,993
You're worried about breaking
the record tomorrow, aren't you?

657
00:53:15,139 --> 00:53:17,073
No.

658
00:53:17,141 --> 00:53:22,169
Oh, honey, you'll do it.
You're gonna be the fastest man alive.

659
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:31,411
Tom...

660
00:53:34,358 --> 00:53:36,292
promise me.

661
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:39,818
What?
No, you have to promise first.

662
00:53:39,897 --> 00:53:42,866
Well, that's silly. How can I promise
something if I don't know what...

663
00:53:42,933 --> 00:53:46,630
Just promise.

664
00:53:48,806 --> 00:53:52,298
I promise.

665
00:53:52,376 --> 00:53:54,435
Now, what did I promise?

666
00:53:56,013 --> 00:53:58,243
I'll tell you tomorrow night.

667
00:54:35,819 --> 00:54:37,810
Thanks, guys.

668
00:54:42,993 --> 00:54:46,588
Well, ready to become
the fastest man on earth?

669
00:54:46,663 --> 00:54:50,429
Ready as I'll ever be.

670
00:54:50,501 --> 00:54:53,698
Oh. What did you
think of this, Tom?

671
00:54:53,771 --> 00:54:59,175
Well, I'm not sure how useful it'll be
to gauge a memory loss, but, uh,

672
00:54:59,243 --> 00:55:03,236
filling it out last night sure brought back
a lot of old ones for me.

673
00:55:32,810 --> 00:55:37,338
Well, my boobs
are as big as Marilyn's.

674
00:55:37,414 --> 00:55:40,850
Lucy, you're
five months pregnant.

675
00:55:40,918 --> 00:55:45,013
Well, maybe she is too. Why else
would a guy like Miller marry her?

676
00:55:45,014 --> 00:55:45,853
Guess.

677
00:55:45,923 --> 00:55:51,193
Sally, he's a writer.
They're only used to the finer things in life.

678
00:55:51,261 --> 00:55:53,593
Honey, there is nothing finer in life.

679
00:55:53,664 --> 00:55:56,724
You are so bad!

680
00:56:34,671 --> 00:56:38,266
<i>There's a yellow rose in Texas</i>

681
00:56:38,342 --> 00:56:40,936
<i>That I am gonna see</i>

682
00:56:41,011 --> 00:56:43,275
<i>Nobody else could miss her</i>

683
00:56:43,347 --> 00:56:45,872
<i>Not half as much as me</i>

684
00:56:45,949 --> 00:56:47,883
<i>She cried so when I left her</i>

685
00:56:47,951 --> 00:56:50,420
Hey, wait a minute. Listen to this.

686
00:56:50,421 --> 00:56:52,183
<i>It like to broke my heart</i>

687
00:56:52,256 --> 00:56:56,317
<i>And if I ever find her
we'll never fall apart</i>

688
00:56:56,393 --> 00:56:58,759
If you don't clear this radio,
Captain Birdell,

689
00:56:58,829 --> 00:57:01,992
the only yellow rose you'll be seeing will be
the one I'll shove up your afterburners.

690
00:57:02,065 --> 00:57:05,557
- Is that clear? Over.
- Uh, that's a roger, Edwards.

691
00:57:08,238 --> 00:57:10,934
Read this.

692
00:57:11,008 --> 00:57:15,536
"Date of birth,
August 8th, 19... 53. "

693
00:57:15,612 --> 00:57:19,173
- Well, that's a typo. He means 1923.
- Keep reading.

694
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:24,210
"What had the most positive impact on
me in high school? Answer: miniskirts.

695
00:57:26,089 --> 00:57:31,886
"What had the most negative impact
on me in high school? Answer: panty hose? "

696
00:57:37,434 --> 00:57:39,368
It's time to mount up, Tom.

697
00:57:39,436 --> 00:57:43,202
Hey, Tom, this is gonna sound
a little weird, but...

698
00:57:43,273 --> 00:57:47,141
right before I got the fire warning light,
I swear I smelled coffee brewing.

699
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:49,872
Maybe it's one of
Weird Ernie's gremlins.

700
00:57:49,947 --> 00:57:51,881
Yeah, maybe.

701
00:57:51,949 --> 00:57:54,110
Good luck, Tom.

702
00:58:07,764 --> 00:58:10,392
Where are you, Albert?

703
00:58:21,244 --> 00:58:23,269
Hmm.

704
00:58:31,922 --> 00:58:35,756
"When feeling lonely, I rent a video
and microwave some popcorn. "

705
00:58:35,826 --> 00:58:39,762
This is gibberish.
Very creative gibberish.

706
00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:42,526
Captain Stratton has answered
each question as if he had...

707
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:45,363
been born in '53
and lived in the future.

708
00:58:45,435 --> 00:58:48,495
Then this whole memory loss thing
is another one of their hoaxes.

709
00:58:48,572 --> 00:58:51,370
I'm afraid so.
Well, how stupid do they think I am?

710
00:58:51,441 --> 00:58:54,433
Pet rocks. Water beds.

711
00:58:54,511 --> 00:58:58,174
What was it he said he was expelled
from college for? Uh, streaking.

712
00:58:58,248 --> 00:59:01,684
He's got a sick mind, Doctor.
They all do.

713
00:59:04,054 --> 00:59:06,045
Maybe they have to.

714
00:59:10,193 --> 00:59:14,721
Okay.

715
00:59:17,968 --> 00:59:22,564
Uh, Albert?

716
00:59:50,967 --> 00:59:54,630
Locked tight. All set, Captain.
Good luck.

717
01:00:11,321 --> 01:00:14,188
<i>Edwards, Mother Hen.
Level at 25,000. </i>

718
01:00:14,257 --> 01:00:18,887
Roger, Mother Hen.
You are clear to drop.

719
01:00:18,962 --> 01:00:21,328
Good luck.

720
01:00:21,398 --> 01:00:24,492

724
01:00:36,446 --> 01:00:39,006
Bombs away.

725
01:00:41,218 --> 01:00:46,212
<i>Albert. !</i>

726
01:00:48,358 --> 01:00:52,124
<i>X-2, Chase One.
Do you have a problem? Over. </i>

727
01:00:52,195 --> 01:00:54,959
I can't fly.

728
01:00:55,031 --> 01:00:58,364
Relax. I can.
Al?

729
01:00:58,435 --> 01:01:03,270
Al? Where are you?
Right here.

730
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:06,969
<i>Hey, Tom, do you read me?
Come in, X-2. </i>

731
01:01:07,043 --> 01:01:10,979
Follow my lead.
Light off one and two.

732
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:20,087
It's a kick in the butt, ain't it?

733
01:01:20,157 --> 01:01:22,489
Match my movements.

734
01:01:38,975 --> 01:01:41,170
Where the hell were you?

735
01:01:41,244 --> 01:01:43,678
I was at the Laker game.
It went into overtime.

736
01:01:43,747 --> 01:01:46,545
A ball game? I nearly died
because you were at a ball game?

737
01:01:46,616 --> 01:01:50,780
It wasn’t just a ball game.
It was a play-off game.

738
01:01:50,854 --> 01:01:54,119
At the party later,
I met this dish named Martha.

739
01:01:54,191 --> 01:01:58,184
I guess I can thank God you didn't
spend the night with this Martha.

740
01:01:58,261 --> 01:02:02,925
Well, I did.
Uh, coming up on Mach 1.

741
01:02:02,999 --> 01:02:05,024
Coming up on Mach 1.

742
01:02:20,517 --> 01:02:22,747
Mach 1. 3.
Nosing over.

743
01:02:22,819 --> 01:02:25,413
Mach 1. 3. 50,000.
N- N-Nosing over.

744
01:02:25,488 --> 01:02:27,820
Now ease the stick forward.
That's enough.

745
01:02:30,894 --> 01:02:33,795
Mach 1. 7.

746
01:02:33,864 --> 01:02:35,832
Mach 2. 68, 69.

747
01:02:35,899 --> 01:02:39,630
Mach 2.

748
01:02:39,703 --> 01:02:45,073
Level at 70,000.
Mach 2. 4. On a profile.

749
01:02:45,141 --> 01:02:48,008
Level at 70,000.
Mach 2. 4.

750
01:02:48,078 --> 01:02:50,410
On profile.

751
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:54,679
Wow. !

752
01:02:56,453 --> 01:02:58,683
It's incredible!

753
01:03:00,223 --> 01:03:05,251
- What now?
- Punch three and go for it.

754
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:15,303
Mach 2. 4, 2. 5.
Outside skin temperature. 685.

755
01:03:15,372 --> 01:03:20,435
- Mach 2. 7. Skin temperature. 750.
- Ride her, cowboy.

756
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:26,716
Mach 2. 8.

757
01:03:26,783 --> 01:03:30,480
- Do you hear that?
- Mach 2. 9. Yes.

758
01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:38,152
Tony didn't smell coffee.
He heard it perking.

759
01:03:38,228 --> 01:03:41,095
It's the fuel, Sam.

760
01:03:41,164 --> 01:03:45,191
The heat is boiling the fuel.
Shut 'em down, Sam. Shut 'em down!

761
01:03:45,268 --> 01:03:46,701
Shut 'em down. !

762
01:04:10,493 --> 01:04:14,054
Pull, Sam. Eject. !

763
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:20,789
I'm still here.
No, damn it, I'm still here. !

764
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:25,391
Al!

765
01:05:39,849 --> 01:05:43,512
You know, Captain, we could be combing the
desert with tweezers and little glass jars...

766
01:05:43,586 --> 01:05:46,453
looking for what's left of you.

767
01:05:46,523 --> 01:05:50,960
You guys are all alike. Losing your
plane's worse than losing your wife.

768
01:05:51,027 --> 01:05:53,860
I'd trade my ex-wife
for any wreck they got.

769
01:05:53,930 --> 01:05:57,457
I'm still here.
Hmm. 'Bout time you realized it.

770
01:05:57,534 --> 01:05:59,525
What now? I'm going to
take your blood pressure.

771
01:05:59,602 --> 01:06:02,366
We could try the A-bomb
theory. No, thank you.

772
01:06:02,439 --> 01:06:06,102
Well, I'm sorry, but it's
necessary. It's not my theory, Sam.

773
01:06:06,176 --> 01:06:10,806
I never bought into that "good deed,
put time right" bull. Not really.

774
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,178
So I'm stuck here?
I don't think so.

775
01:06:13,249 --> 01:06:17,185
Maybe not. A few tests at the hospital,
and you should be able to go home.

776
01:06:17,253 --> 01:06:19,881
Maybe you could leap back when you least
suspect it, like tonight when you're sleeping.

777
01:06:19,956 --> 01:06:23,153
Do you really believe that?
Absolutely. I don't know.

778
01:06:23,226 --> 01:06:25,592
I don't see any reason to keep you
in the hospital. But in the meantime,

779
01:06:25,662 --> 01:06:29,189
there's no reason for me to stay here,
and I would feel really bad...

780
01:06:29,265 --> 01:06:34,066
if Martha woke up and found out that I'd gone
without even saying good morning, you know?

781
01:06:34,137 --> 01:06:36,264
It's not nice.

782
01:06:38,475 --> 01:06:41,035
Unless your blood pressure
keeps elevating.

783
01:06:50,587 --> 01:06:55,990
<i>Dr. Berger,
please contact the ward nurse. </i>

784
01:06:56,059 --> 01:06:58,050
Daddy!

785
01:06:59,395 --> 01:07:02,421
Hey.
Hey, I'm okay.

786
01:07:07,137 --> 01:07:11,164
Peg went into premature labor
when she heard the crash.

787
01:07:11,241 --> 01:07:13,232
Okay, I'll be right.

788
01:07:16,212 --> 01:07:20,706
Look, I know you want
to be with your mom.

789
01:07:20,783 --> 01:07:22,808
And you will.
But, uh,

790
01:07:22,886 --> 01:07:27,084
right now I want you to stay
with Sally and Lucy, okay?

791
01:07:27,157 --> 01:07:31,116
They're both pregnant, and they're
very frightened. You understand?

792
01:07:32,428 --> 01:07:35,192
Yes, sir.

793
01:07:35,265 --> 01:07:38,200
She'll be fine, son.

794
01:07:38,268 --> 01:07:40,259
I promise.

795
01:07:44,274 --> 01:07:46,265
Tom, what...

796
01:07:55,385 --> 01:07:57,319
Is she dilated any further?

797
01:07:57,387 --> 01:07:59,878
Tom. Tom!

798
01:08:01,624 --> 01:08:04,559
Oh. ! Oh. !

799
01:08:04,627 --> 01:08:06,618
Oh!

800
01:08:10,934 --> 01:08:14,700
Oh, I knew
you'd keep your promise.

801
01:08:14,771 --> 01:08:17,205
It'll take more than
a gremlin to kill me.

802
01:08:17,273 --> 01:08:19,935
Hey, did you set a record?

803
01:08:20,009 --> 01:08:24,639
I guess so.
Oh, I'm so proud of you!

804
01:08:28,017 --> 01:08:31,509
Look at me. Look at me.
Take a deep breath.

805
01:08:31,588 --> 01:08:34,785
Hold it...
and let it out like this.

806
01:08:43,833 --> 01:08:46,461
Okay?

807
01:08:46,536 --> 01:08:49,699
Where did you learn to do that? Premed.

808
01:08:51,274 --> 01:08:53,299
Oh, Tom!

809
01:08:55,245 --> 01:08:57,475
Excuse me. Tom?

810
01:08:59,782 --> 01:09:01,716
I'll be right back.

811
01:09:07,223 --> 01:09:10,090
Tom, this is Dr. Blaustein.

812
01:09:10,159 --> 01:09:14,892
It's not good, Captain. The baby's
gonna arrive at least nine weeks premature.

813
01:09:14,964 --> 01:09:18,161
The nearest neonatal
intensive care unit's in L. A.

814
01:09:18,234 --> 01:09:19,630
Now, we've got a plane standing by...

815
01:09:19,631 --> 01:09:21,863
but considering the shock
that your wife's been through...

816
01:09:21,938 --> 01:09:23,872
I don't want to risk moving her.

817
01:09:23,940 --> 01:09:28,877
It's your decision, Tom. I'd recommend
delivering here and flying the baby to L. A.

818
01:09:28,945 --> 01:09:32,312
The baby won't have a chance.
Not much, but your wife will.

819
01:09:34,083 --> 01:09:38,577
Dr. Cooper to O. R. 3.
Dr. Cooper to O. R. 3.

820
01:09:38,655 --> 01:09:40,748
How far apart are
the contractions?

821
01:09:40,823 --> 01:09:43,690
It's early labor. It's just
started. How far dilated?

822
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:46,251
Two centimeters,
and the cervix is partial effaced.

823
01:09:46,329 --> 01:09:51,289
Then it's early enough to stop. Captain,
once labor's started you can't stop it.

824
01:09:51,367 --> 01:09:56,395
Of course you can. Start her on
a beta sympathomimetic. A what?

825
01:09:56,472 --> 01:09:59,339
A beta sympathomimetic.

826
01:09:59,409 --> 01:10:04,176
I'm not sure which one. Obstetrics isn't
my specialty. Probably ritodrine or terbuta...

827
01:10:04,247 --> 01:10:08,274
Hell, those didn't come out till the
late '70s. Excuse us a minute, Doctor.

828
01:10:08,351 --> 01:10:11,548
Captain, the only reason I'm not
kicking you from here to the flight line...

829
01:10:11,621 --> 01:10:13,486
is that woman down the hall needs you.

830
01:10:13,556 --> 01:10:18,152
She doesn't have to deliver. I know what
I'm talking about. Now you're a doctor?

831
01:10:18,227 --> 01:10:20,388
Evidently.

832
01:10:20,463 --> 01:10:22,761
Tom, considering what
you've been through today,

833
01:10:22,832 --> 01:10:25,528
I'm gonna make an allowance
for your behavior up to now.

834
01:10:25,601 --> 01:10:29,560
But if you persist in wasting our time with
this little sham you and Captain Birdell...

835
01:10:29,639 --> 01:10:33,234
are trying to perpetrate, mister,
I'll see you never fly again!

836
01:10:33,309 --> 01:10:36,210
It's not a sham.
Those answers are true.

837
01:10:36,279 --> 01:10:40,739
Dr. Ernst was right.
You are one sick bastard.

838
01:10:40,817 --> 01:10:42,842
Alcohol.

839
01:10:42,919 --> 01:10:46,252
A five percent solution of ethanol
alcohol in dextrose and water...

840
01:10:46,322 --> 01:10:48,313
intravenously administered
will stop labor.

841
01:10:48,391 --> 01:10:52,521
The technique was developed in the '60s.
Beta sympathomimetics replaced it in the '70s.

842
01:10:52,595 --> 01:10:55,189
But it'll still work.
Use your brain, damn it!

843
01:10:55,264 --> 01:10:58,062
What will an intravenous
five percent solution of alcohol do?

844
01:10:59,135 --> 01:11:01,126
Get her instantly drunk,

845
01:11:02,638 --> 01:11:06,438
which will interfere
with the oxytocins...

846
01:11:06,509 --> 01:11:09,569
her brain's releasing
to stimulate the uterine contractions.

847
01:11:09,645 --> 01:11:14,173
Thank you.

848
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:16,275
Did you hear any of that, Barry?
Yeah, I did.

849
01:11:16,352 --> 01:11:19,981
What do you think? Well, let's give
it a try. Nurse, prepare an I. V...

850
01:11:20,056 --> 01:11:24,015
Que sera, sera

851
01:11:24,093 --> 01:11:29,224
Whatever will be, will be

852
01:11:29,298 --> 01:11:34,065
The future's not ours to see

853
01:11:34,137 --> 01:11:37,698
Que sera, sera

854
01:11:37,774 --> 01:11:43,337
What will be, will be

855
01:11:46,215 --> 01:11:48,183
Well, what do you think, boys?

856
01:11:48,251 --> 01:11:51,914
We have Doris Day
for a patient. Well?

857
01:11:51,988 --> 01:11:56,220
She's gonna have one beaut of a
hangover, but she's not gonna deliver.

858
01:11:56,292 --> 01:11:58,538
Do you want to tell me how
in the hell Captain Stratton...

859
01:11:58,539 --> 01:11:59,420
Barry, do me a favor.

860
01:11:59,495 --> 01:12:02,464
Hmm?
Don't ask.

861
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:06,767
Hey, flyboy,
the squares are gone.

862
01:12:06,836 --> 01:12:08,827
You wanna boogie?

863
01:12:18,448 --> 01:12:21,076
I love you.

864
01:12:21,150 --> 01:12:23,448
I love you too, Peg.

865
01:13:23,713 --> 01:13:26,807
Hey, Fox. !
Fox, what ya posing for?

866
01:13:26,883 --> 01:13:30,114
Ain't nobody gonna take your picture.

867
01:13:43,132 --> 01:13:46,465
Nice catch, Foxy.

868
01:13:46,536 --> 01:13:50,165
This is it, folks.
Down by five, the last of the ninth.

869
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:54,903
Unless the Bombers can pull a miracle and
win this final game of the 68th season,

870
01:13:54,977 --> 01:13:57,844
it's the cellar
for the third year in a row.

871
01:13:57,914 --> 01:14:02,442
The bottom of the ninth is brought to
you tonight, as it has been all year long,

872
01:14:02,518 --> 01:14:04,986
by Shneck and Shneck
Funeral Parlors,

873
01:14:05,054 --> 01:14:09,423
serving Waco and
the Texas Hill Country for 43 years.

874
01:14:09,492 --> 01:14:12,791
All right, now, put some fire under it. !

875
01:14:12,862 --> 01:14:17,697
Hustle, boys! Now hustle!
We're gonna beat these Okies.

876
01:14:34,917 --> 01:14:38,182
Fox! Do something!

877
01:14:38,254 --> 01:14:40,518
Me? Why me?

878
01:14:40,590 --> 01:14:42,114
It's your dog.

879
01:14:44,393 --> 01:14:48,227
He knew. The little sucker knew.

880
01:14:48,297 --> 01:14:51,323
And he wasn't gonna stop barking
until they all knew.

881
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:54,130
Stray dogs are pretty common
on the farm belt,

882
01:14:54,203 --> 01:14:57,661
and one of the first things my dad taught
me was how to face the wild ones down.

883
01:14:58,874 --> 01:15:01,900
You look them straight in the eye,
and you let 'em know who's boss.

884
01:15:10,152 --> 01:15:14,350
Of course, it had been a long time
since I was a kid.

885
01:15:16,826 --> 01:15:18,851
Then again,

886
01:15:21,263 --> 01:15:24,926
once you've got the touch,
you never lose it.

887
01:15:25,001 --> 01:15:27,526
- That's the damnedest thing I ever saw.
- How'd you teach him that, Foxy?

888
01:15:27,603 --> 01:15:29,594
Well... Aah!

889
01:15:31,607 --> 01:15:34,337
Barnes lines a solid shot
down the aisle in right center.

890
01:15:34,410 --> 01:15:38,244
Pace is chasing it back into the corner.
Barnes is rounding first.

891
01:15:40,950 --> 01:15:43,384
Here comes the throw to second, and he
- Safe!

892
01:15:43,452 --> 01:15:45,113
He's safe!

893
01:15:45,187 --> 01:15:50,056
Well, the Bombers get their second hit
of the game, and it's a double! Oh!

894
01:15:52,094 --> 01:15:56,588
No wonder they're in the cellar. They got
about as much enthusiasm as a $10 hooker.

895
01:15:56,666 --> 01:15:58,634
Come on.

896
01:15:58,701 --> 01:16:01,636
I want to watch the game.
Will you follow me?

897
01:16:01,704 --> 01:16:05,731
- I can't. I'm up after Matt.
- Yeah. Right.

898
01:16:05,808 --> 01:16:09,574
- Something wrong, Fox?
- Uh, no. I'm gonna...

899
01:16:09,645 --> 01:16:13,479
I'll be back in a minute. I'm
just gonna, ... you know.

900
01:16:13,549 --> 01:16:16,017
Make it snappy.

901
01:16:17,119 --> 01:16:18,882
Strike!

902
01:16:18,954 --> 01:16:23,482
The next son of a gun that swings at
the first pitch, I'm gonna fine 50 bucks!

903
01:16:23,559 --> 01:16:25,550
Al!

904
01:16:32,101 --> 01:16:34,262
How'd you get here so fast?

905
01:16:34,336 --> 01:16:36,964
It's been a week since
you quantum leaped. A week?

906
01:16:37,039 --> 01:16:40,634
A couple of minutes ago
I was in the hospital with Peg.

907
01:16:40,710 --> 01:16:44,407
Well, you've been bouncing
around in time, Sam.

908
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:46,744
It may have seemed like
a couple of minutes to you,

909
01:16:46,816 --> 01:16:50,343
but we've been popping
champagne for six days.

910
01:16:50,419 --> 01:16:53,115
Oh, it was a hell of a party too.

911
01:16:53,189 --> 01:16:57,558
Gooshie, he got so wasted that
he had Ziggy printing X-rated pictures.

912
01:16:57,626 --> 01:17:00,254
And you know Brenda,
the cute little redhead in coding?

913
01:17:00,329 --> 01:17:03,355
She got so turned on!

914
01:17:03,432 --> 01:17:06,094
No, I don't know Brenda,
or I don't remember Brenda.

915
01:17:06,168 --> 01:17:08,534
And I certainly don't care
how turned on she got.

916
01:17:08,604 --> 01:17:11,801
I'm in a real identity crisis here, Al.

917
01:17:11,874 --> 01:17:15,435
I mean, one minute I'm Tom Stratton,
and the next I'm a ball player named Fox.

918
01:17:15,511 --> 01:17:20,312
Tim Fox, 32-year-old third baseman
for the Waco Bombers.

919
01:17:20,382 --> 01:17:24,819
According to Ziggy, you hit... 415 in
'63 and got called up to Chicago...

920
01:17:24,887 --> 01:17:30,792
where you broke your leg sliding into
second and got sent back down to recover.

921
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:33,124
That was five years ago.

922
01:17:44,406 --> 01:17:46,340
Oh, boy!

923
01:17:46,408 --> 01:17:49,377
Hey, come on, Sam.
We're missing the game!

924
01:17:49,445 --> 01:17:52,175
The hell with the game!
It's your last one in organized ball.

925
01:17:52,248 --> 01:17:55,012
In a couple of minutes
you're gonna fly out to center.

926
01:17:55,084 --> 01:17:57,109
The Bombers are gonna finish
another season in the cellar,

927
01:17:57,186 --> 01:18:00,713
and you're gonna hang up
your spikes. Then what?

928
01:18:00,790 --> 01:18:04,055
Well, you're gonna open up a Kentucky
Fried Chicken franchise. What?

929
01:18:04,126 --> 01:18:06,390
You'll marry a girl named Sue
and have two kids.

930
01:18:06,462 --> 01:18:08,396
Of course, you don't have to be
around for all of that.

931
01:18:08,464 --> 01:18:13,868
Soon as we can figure out what needs
to be put right, you'll leap outta here.

932
01:18:13,936 --> 01:18:17,167
Like fly the X-2
to Mach 3 and live?

933
01:18:17,239 --> 01:18:19,036
Hey, Ziggy blew it!
Yeah.

934
01:18:19,108 --> 01:18:23,272
He didn't research it enough.
Originally, Tom Stratton not only died,

935
01:18:23,345 --> 01:18:26,781
but his wife went into premature labor,
and the baby was stillborn.

936
01:18:26,849 --> 01:18:28,373
And now?
Tom's alive!

937
01:18:28,450 --> 01:18:32,113
Peg gave birth to a healthy baby girl,
seven pounds, eight ounces.

938
01:18:32,188 --> 01:18:36,124
Funny thing.
They happened to name her Samantha.

939
01:18:36,192 --> 01:18:39,218
Seems like someone wanted
both Tom and Samantha to survive.

940
01:18:39,295 --> 01:18:40,887
Yeah.

941
01:18:40,963 --> 01:18:43,864
Come on, Jackson's up.
He's gonna hit a homer with one on!

942
01:18:45,467 --> 01:18:48,334
You're a vampire.

943
01:18:48,404 --> 01:18:52,431
What? Neurological
holograms don't reflect, Sam.

944
01:18:52,508 --> 01:18:56,569
Obviously when it comes to quantum
physics, you're still a mental slug.

945
01:18:56,645 --> 01:18:59,443
But we can talk about this later.
Come on. I hate to miss the game.

946
01:18:59,515 --> 01:19:02,040
You already know how
it's going to end.

947
01:19:02,117 --> 01:19:07,851
I knew how it was gonna end
when I took Brenda into the filing room.

948
01:19:07,923 --> 01:19:10,084
I still took her.

949
01:19:12,561 --> 01:19:15,724
There's the homer.
Why didn't I leap all the way?

950
01:19:15,798 --> 01:19:19,393
Twelve years in a blink isn't bad, pal.
A couple more of those, you'll be back home.

951
01:19:19,468 --> 01:19:22,665
If I leap forward again.
What if I leap back?

952
01:19:22,738 --> 01:19:24,797
That is always possible.

953
01:19:24,874 --> 01:19:27,707
In other words, I could be
bouncing around in time forever?

954
01:19:27,776 --> 01:19:30,768
No. Nobody lives forever.

955
01:19:34,516 --> 01:19:38,247
What does Ziggy say I have to put right
to leap this time? He isn't saying.

956
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:39,685
What?
He's depressed.

957
01:19:39,755 --> 01:19:42,121
He's a computer.
He's got a big ego.

958
01:19:42,191 --> 01:19:47,527
I think he knows what you have to do. He's
just afraid to print it out in case he's wrong.

959
01:19:47,596 --> 01:19:49,996
Who created this Ziggy?

960
01:19:53,569 --> 01:19:59,474
You. Quantum Leap
is your project, Sam.

961
01:19:59,541 --> 01:20:01,975
You're the genius behind it.

962
01:20:02,044 --> 01:20:05,707
At least you were before
your brain got magna-foozled.

963
01:20:05,781 --> 01:20:11,185
No, no. See, I'm a medical doctor.
I found that much out.

964
01:20:11,253 --> 01:20:13,153
You hold six doctorates, Sam.

965
01:20:13,222 --> 01:20:17,124
Medicine is just one of them.
Your special gift was quantum physics.

966
01:20:17,192 --> 01:20:19,854
Time magazine even
called you the next Einstein.

967
01:20:19,929 --> 01:20:22,124
The truth is...

968
01:20:22,197 --> 01:20:27,066
if there's one guy who could
figure out how to bring you back...

969
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:29,070
it's you.

970
01:20:34,343 --> 01:20:37,107
And I can't even
remember my name.

971
01:20:42,384 --> 01:20:46,844
It's Beckett.

972
01:20:51,226 --> 01:20:53,160
Sam Beckett.

973
01:21:10,612 --> 01:21:13,547
Jackson hits a towering smash...

974
01:21:13,615 --> 01:21:17,073
over the Shneck and Shneck billboard
in center field. !

975
01:21:17,152 --> 01:21:21,589
And the Bombers have pulled
within a run. Ooo-wee. !

976
01:21:26,996 --> 01:21:29,362
Long distance.

977
01:21:29,431 --> 01:21:31,365
Long distance?

978
01:21:31,433 --> 01:21:35,062
Yes, I'd like to call
a John Beckett...

979
01:21:35,137 --> 01:21:38,300
in Elk Ridge, Indiana.

980
01:21:38,374 --> 01:21:40,774
And I-I-I don't have the number.

981
01:21:40,843 --> 01:21:42,902
John Beckett?

982
01:21:42,978 --> 01:21:46,345
Yes, ma'am. Beckett.
One moment, please.

983
01:21:53,689 --> 01:21:55,680
Hello?

984
01:21:58,794 --> 01:22:00,523
Dad?

985
01:22:00,596 --> 01:22:06,432
What? Who is this?
Hello? Hello?

986
01:22:06,502 --> 01:22:09,403
Look, whoever this is,
I got no time for tomfoolery.

987
01:22:09,471 --> 01:22:11,132
Please, don't hang up.

988
01:22:11,206 --> 01:22:13,197
Who is this?

989
01:22:15,144 --> 01:22:18,580
I- I'm a Beckett.

990
01:22:18,647 --> 01:22:22,105
My father and your father
are related.

991
01:22:22,184 --> 01:22:24,175
How?

992
01:22:25,387 --> 01:22:29,915
Uh, they're brothers.

993
01:22:29,992 --> 01:22:31,983
I'm John's son.

994
01:22:32,061 --> 01:22:36,589
John's son? My God, he moved to
Australia when I was just a kid.

995
01:22:36,665 --> 01:22:39,793
Huh! Listen to me telling you
what your father did.

996
01:22:39,868 --> 01:22:41,836
That's all right.

997
01:22:41,904 --> 01:22:45,897
What's your name?
Sam.

998
01:22:45,974 --> 01:22:49,466
Well, I'll be darned.
I've named my boy Sam.

999
01:22:49,545 --> 01:22:53,174
How about that?
You don't sound Australian, Sam.

1000
01:22:53,248 --> 01:22:56,376
Well, I-I-I travel a lot.

1001
01:23:00,255 --> 01:23:02,485
I don't believe it. !

1002
01:23:02,558 --> 01:23:05,527
Flash hit a stand-up double.

1003
01:23:07,362 --> 01:23:09,990
I don't want to disappoint
my dad, but I...

1004
01:23:10,065 --> 01:23:13,330
I don't think I'm gonna be able to
make it home for Thanksgiving this year.

1005
01:23:13,402 --> 01:23:16,803
Well, I know he'll understand.
I hope so.

1006
01:23:16,872 --> 01:23:19,966
It doesn't mean I don't love him.
I do, and I miss him a lot too,

1007
01:23:20,042 --> 01:23:22,033
even...

1008
01:23:24,246 --> 01:23:26,840
even if I never...
I never told him.

1009
01:23:26,915 --> 01:23:29,145
He knows.
You think so?

1010
01:23:29,218 --> 01:23:33,314
Well, a boy can't feel about his dad
the way you do without his knowing it.

1011
01:23:35,891 --> 01:23:37,756
Maybe.

1012
01:23:37,826 --> 01:23:42,263
But when I don't show for Thanksgiving,
it's-it's gonna hurt him.

1013
01:23:42,331 --> 01:23:46,631
Sam, it's nice to have
the children home for the holidays,

1014
01:23:46,702 --> 01:23:50,035
but sometimes
it can't happen.

1015
01:23:50,105 --> 01:23:53,074
You're a young man trying to
make your mark in the world, and...

1016
01:23:53,142 --> 01:23:55,329
how you go about doing
that's a lot more important

1017
01:23:55,330 --> 01:23:58,170
to your father than
showing up for turkey.

1018
01:23:58,247 --> 01:24:00,374
At least
it would be for me.

1019
01:24:03,585 --> 01:24:06,748
Coming from you, that means...
that means a lot.

1020
01:24:06,822 --> 01:24:09,723
Now you can't make it
to Australia for the holidays,

1021
01:24:09,791 --> 01:24:13,124
but... we're a lot closer.

1022
01:24:13,195 --> 01:24:15,857
Why don't you come up here?
We got plenty of room,

1023
01:24:15,931 --> 01:24:20,891
and Mom's pumpkin pie has taken a blue ribbon
at the Elk Ridge County Fair for ten years.

1024
01:24:22,404 --> 01:24:26,033
Well, I don't know
if I'll be able to, but I'm...

1025
01:24:26,108 --> 01:24:28,076
I'm sure gonna try.

1026
01:24:28,143 --> 01:24:31,408
Well, it doesn't have to be
Thanksgiving either.

1027
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:34,449
You wanna drop by here
anytime, you're welcome.

1028
01:24:37,052 --> 01:24:39,043
I'll remember that.

1029
01:24:43,492 --> 01:24:46,256
Good-bye.

1030
01:24:46,328 --> 01:24:48,319
I love you, Dad.

1031
01:25:04,413 --> 01:25:06,938
Hey, Dad, that calf
is gonna drop any second.

1032
01:25:07,015 --> 01:25:09,848
I'll get my sweater, Sam.

1033
01:25:09,918 --> 01:25:13,479
I just talked to
my Uncle John's son from Australia.

1034
01:25:13,555 --> 01:25:15,523
He may come for the holidays.

1035
01:25:15,591 --> 01:25:17,650
Can he milk cows?

1036
01:25:19,394 --> 01:25:21,328
Come on.

1037
01:25:40,682 --> 01:25:42,775
Thank you.

1038
01:25:59,635 --> 01:26:02,695
You know, maybe this quantum leaping...

1039
01:26:02,771 --> 01:26:04,898
isn't such a bad deal after all.

1040
01:26:04,973 --> 01:26:06,907
Getting a second chance
to put things right,

1041
01:26:06,975 --> 01:26:11,173
to make the world a better place.

1042
01:26:11,246 --> 01:26:14,079
Who knows what I can accomplish
before I'm done.

1043
01:26:29,665 --> 01:26:31,656
Thanks, Al.

1044
01:26:34,970 --> 01:26:38,406
Go fly out.

1045
01:26:38,473 --> 01:26:41,601
I don't know, Al.
Maybe I'm here to win this one.

1046
01:26:45,314 --> 01:26:50,217
The tying run is on second, and the
potential winning run is coming up to bat!

1047
01:26:50,285 --> 01:26:56,246
Hey, Fox!
Tim, this is my last year too,

1048
01:26:56,325 --> 01:27:01,058
and, uh, I don't want
to end it in the cellar.

1049
01:27:12,507 --> 01:27:15,067
Go, Foxy! Go, Foxy!

1050
01:27:15,143 --> 01:27:19,375
Foxy! Foxy! Foxy!

1051
01:27:19,448 --> 01:27:22,008
Give me one with
a four-bagger in it, son.

1052
01:27:25,787 --> 01:27:29,484
Go on, Foxy.

1053
01:27:29,558 --> 01:27:32,391
Are you serious, Sam?

1054
01:27:32,461 --> 01:27:35,191
You notice who that kid kind of
looks like out there? Yeah.

1055
01:27:35,263 --> 01:27:38,562
Yeah? Yeah?
You're gonna fly to center.

1056
01:27:38,633 --> 01:27:42,592
Fox flied out to center.
I'm not Fox.

1057
01:27:42,671 --> 01:27:45,902
Yeah, well, you're not Roy Hobbs either.

1058
01:27:52,147 --> 01:27:54,911
Fox, representing the winning run,
steps to the plate.

1059
01:27:54,983 --> 01:28:00,216
A switch-hitter, Fox has 28 home runs
this year, 12 of them batting left-handed.

1060
01:28:04,326 --> 01:28:08,990
Be patient in there now!
Be patient!

1061
01:28:23,078 --> 01:28:26,138
Strike one!

1062
01:28:26,214 --> 01:28:29,706
Well, now, at least there's someone
around here who can follow orders.

1063
01:28:42,697 --> 01:28:45,291
Strike two!

1064
01:28:50,872 --> 01:28:54,740
That last one had to be
over 100 miles an hour.

1065
01:28:54,810 --> 01:28:57,745
I'll get the next one.
Did you ask for time?

1066
01:28:57,813 --> 01:29:00,247
No. Play ball.
All right. Let's go.

1067
01:29:00,315 --> 01:29:02,078
"When it comes to that
final out in life,

1068
01:29:02,150 --> 01:29:06,348
"whether you pop out,
ground out or fly out, remember.

1069
01:29:06,421 --> 01:29:10,790
Shneck and Shneck will always
be there to bring you home. "

1070
01:29:10,859 --> 01:29:13,760
Fox steps back into the box.
He digs in.

1071
01:29:13,829 --> 01:29:18,823
Behind 0 and 2 in the count, he looks
determined not to let another pitch go by.

1072
01:29:58,473 --> 01:30:00,771
Strike three. !
