00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,432
SAGAN:
The sky calls to us.

2
00:00:47,803 --> 00:00:49,896
If we do not destroy ourselves...

3
00:00:50,105 --> 00:00:53,131
...we will one day venture
to the stars.

4
00:00:54,042 --> 00:00:57,500
There was a time when the stars
seemed an impenetrable mystery.

5
00:00:57,713 --> 00:01:01,046
Today, we have begun
to understand them.

6
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:06,187
In our personal lives also, we
journey from ignorance to knowledge.

7
00:01:06,421 --> 00:01:10,858
Our individual growth reflects
the advancement of the species.

8
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,294
The exploration of the cosmos is...

9
00:01:13,495 --> 00:01:16,521
...a voyage of self-discovery.

10
00:01:27,042 --> 00:01:29,977
When I was a child, I lived here...

11
00:01:30,178 --> 00:01:34,478
...in the Bensonhurst section of
Brooklyn in the city of New York.

12
00:01:34,683 --> 00:01:37,743
I knew my immediate
neighborhood intimately...

13
00:01:37,953 --> 00:01:42,219
...every candy store, front stoop...

14
00:01:42,424 --> 00:01:44,688
...back yard, empty lot...

15
00:01:44,893 --> 00:01:47,987
...and wall for playing
Chinese handball.

16
00:01:53,602 --> 00:01:55,729
It was my whole world.

17
00:02:14,823 --> 00:02:16,950
But more than a few blocks away...

18
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:21,858
...north of the raucous traffic
and elevated railway on 86th Street...

19
00:02:22,064 --> 00:02:25,727
...was an unknown territory
off-limits to my wanderings.

20
00:02:26,668 --> 00:02:29,432
It could have been Mars
for all I knew.

21
00:02:33,542 --> 00:02:36,375
Even with an early bedtime
in the winter...

22
00:02:36,645 --> 00:02:39,637
...you could occasionally see
the stars.

23
00:02:40,148 --> 00:02:43,447
I would look up at them
and wonder what they were.

24
00:02:43,752 --> 00:02:46,516
I'd ask other kids and adults...

25
00:02:47,089 --> 00:02:48,681
...and they would answer:

26
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,949
"They're lights in the sky, kid."

27
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:55,118
Well, I could tell they were lights
in the sky, but what were they?

28
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,766
There had to be some deeper answer.

29
00:03:04,172 --> 00:03:07,664
I remember I was issued
my first library card.

30
00:03:07,876 --> 00:03:12,438
It was some library on 85th Street.
Anyway, it was in alien territory.

31
00:03:12,914 --> 00:03:16,611
And I asked the librarian
for a book on stars.

32
00:03:17,052 --> 00:03:18,485
She gave me...

33
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,855
...a picture book with portraits
of men and women...

34
00:03:22,057 --> 00:03:25,686
...with names like
Veronica Lake and Alan Ladd.

35
00:03:26,228 --> 00:03:29,629
I explained that wasn't what
I wanted at all.

36
00:03:30,232 --> 00:03:33,668
And for some reason,
then obscure to me, she smiled...

37
00:03:33,869 --> 00:03:37,032
...and got me another book,
the right kind of book.

38
00:03:37,339 --> 00:03:39,637
I was so excited to know
the answer...

39
00:03:39,841 --> 00:03:42,901
...I opened the book breathlessly,
right there in the library...

40
00:03:43,111 --> 00:03:45,944
...and the book said
something astonishing...

41
00:03:46,148 --> 00:03:48,639
...a very big thought.

42
00:03:49,351 --> 00:03:52,684
Stars, it said, were suns...

43
00:03:52,888 --> 00:03:54,651
...but very far away.

44
00:03:54,856 --> 00:03:58,792
The sun was a star, but close-up.

45
00:04:06,468 --> 00:04:10,199
How, I wondered, could anybody
know such things for sure?

46
00:04:10,405 --> 00:04:13,932
How did they figure it out?
Where did they even begin?

47
00:04:23,485 --> 00:04:26,454
I was ignorant of the idea
of angular size.

48
00:04:26,655 --> 00:04:30,648
I didn't know about the inverse square
law of the propagation of light.

49
00:04:30,859 --> 00:04:34,659
I didn't have any chance of
calculating the distance to the stars.

50
00:04:34,863 --> 00:04:37,957
But I could tell that if
the stars were suns...

51
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,634
...they had to be awfully far away.

52
00:04:40,836 --> 00:04:45,068
Further away than 86th Street,
further away than Manhattan...

53
00:04:45,273 --> 00:04:48,640
...further away, probably,
than New Jersey.

54
00:04:48,844 --> 00:04:52,541
The universe had become
much grander...

55
00:04:52,748 --> 00:04:55,114
...than I had ever guessed.

56
00:04:58,053 --> 00:05:00,715
And then I read
another astonishing fact.

57
00:05:00,922 --> 00:05:04,221
The Earth, which includes Brooklyn...

58
00:05:04,426 --> 00:05:05,723
...was a planet.

59
00:05:05,927 --> 00:05:07,986
It went around the sun.

60
00:05:08,196 --> 00:05:09,788
There were other planets.

61
00:05:09,998 --> 00:05:12,262
They also went around the sun...

62
00:05:12,467 --> 00:05:15,766
...some closer to the sun,
some further from the sun.

63
00:05:16,004 --> 00:05:20,532
But planets didn't shine by their
own light the way the sun does.

64
00:05:21,276 --> 00:05:25,235
No, planets simply reflected
the little bit of light...

65
00:05:25,447 --> 00:05:29,042
...that shines on them
from the sun back to us.

66
00:05:29,251 --> 00:05:31,515
If you were a great distance
from the sun...

67
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,451
...you wouldn't be able to see
the Earth or the other planets at all.

68
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:38,386
Well, then, it stood
to reason, I thought...

69
00:05:38,593 --> 00:05:42,222
...that those other stars ought to
have their own planets...

70
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,694
...and some of those planets
ought to have life.

71
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:46,561
Why not?

72
00:05:46,768 --> 00:05:51,171
And that life ought to be pretty
different from life as we know it...

73
00:05:51,373 --> 00:05:53,364
...life here in Brooklyn.

74
00:05:53,575 --> 00:05:56,703
Ganymede. Look at this
amazing Ganymede stuff.

75
00:05:56,912 --> 00:05:57,970
Wait, wait, wait.

76
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,580
As a child, it was
my immense good fortune...

77
00:06:00,782 --> 00:06:04,809
...to have parents and a few teachers
who encouraged my curiosity.

78
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,352
This was my 6th-grade classroom.

79
00:06:07,556 --> 00:06:10,525
I came back here one day
to remember what it was like.

80
00:06:10,725 --> 00:06:13,455
I brought some of the pictures
of other worlds...

81
00:06:13,662 --> 00:06:16,290
...that were radioed back
by the Voyager spacecraft...

82
00:06:16,498 --> 00:06:18,625
...of Jupiter and its moons.

83
00:06:18,834 --> 00:06:20,392
This is Calisto which is...

84
00:06:20,602 --> 00:06:21,762
(SAGAN LAUGHS)

85
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:26,073
What is a Calisto?
I want a Calisto.

86
00:06:26,274 --> 00:06:27,571
Now you got it.
What is it?

87
00:06:27,776 --> 00:06:31,268
It's the outermost
big moon of Jupiter.

88
00:06:32,347 --> 00:06:34,781
Who is this guy? Europa.

89
00:06:36,184 --> 00:06:37,811
Another Europa.

90
00:06:38,186 --> 00:06:41,246
A black-and-white picture
of a ring of Jupiter.

91
00:06:41,656 --> 00:06:44,682
There you go.
That's a prize for honesty.

92
00:06:45,327 --> 00:06:46,817
You didn't get a second.

93
00:06:47,028 --> 00:06:48,518
Which one would you like?

94
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:03,769
Every one of us begins life
with an open mind...

95
00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:07,915
...a driving curiosity,
a sense of wonder.

96
00:07:09,017 --> 00:07:12,350
I thought it might be fun
if we now had some questions.

97
00:07:12,554 --> 00:07:16,456
Why is the Earth round?
Why isn't it square or any other shape?

98
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:18,750
That's a good question.

99
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,397
That's a question I've asked myself.
The answer has to do with gravity.

100
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:25,730
The Earth has a strong gravity.

101
00:07:25,934 --> 00:07:28,494
If you were to make a mountain
very high...

102
00:07:28,703 --> 00:07:31,604
...higher than Everest,
the biggest mountain on Earth...

103
00:07:31,806 --> 00:07:34,138
...it would be crushed
by its own weight.

104
00:07:34,342 --> 00:07:37,004
Gravity pulls everything
towards the center.

105
00:07:37,212 --> 00:07:40,477
So any really big bump
on the Earth is crushed.

106
00:07:40,682 --> 00:07:44,311
But if you had a small object,
a tiny world...

107
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:46,180
...the gravity is very low...

108
00:07:46,388 --> 00:07:49,551
...and then it can be very different
from a sphere.

109
00:07:49,758 --> 00:07:54,161
I think I have here
a world that isn't a sphere.

110
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:55,587
Here.

111
00:07:56,798 --> 00:07:58,129
Look at this one.

112
00:07:59,334 --> 00:08:00,824
See? It's lumpy.

113
00:08:02,604 --> 00:08:03,798
It's a lumpy world.

114
00:08:04,873 --> 00:08:06,238
It looks like a potato.

115
00:08:06,975 --> 00:08:10,138
There's a large potato
orbiting the planet Mars.

116
00:08:10,345 --> 00:08:12,575
This is one of the moons of Mars.

117
00:08:12,781 --> 00:08:15,011
That's a perfect example.

118
00:08:15,216 --> 00:08:19,209
You can have big departures from
a sphere if your gravity is low.

119
00:08:19,421 --> 00:08:21,321
Now the question in the front.

120
00:08:21,523 --> 00:08:24,754
Is the sun considered part
of the Milky Way galaxy?

121
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,088
Sure, you're considered part
of the Milky Way galaxy.

122
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:32,830
Everything except other galaxies is
part of the Milky Way galaxy.

123
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:34,592
The sun is one star.

124
00:08:34,803 --> 00:08:39,740
There is a few hundred billion stars
in the Milky Way.

125
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:42,771
Around each star, maybe,
is a whole bunch of planets.

126
00:08:43,645 --> 00:08:46,876
And on one of those planets is life...

127
00:08:47,082 --> 00:08:50,950
...and one of the life forms
on that planet is you.

128
00:08:51,152 --> 00:08:53,518
You're a part of
the Milky Way galaxy too.

129
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:08,936
Sometimes I think, how lucky we are
to live in this time...

130
00:09:09,137 --> 00:09:12,800
...the first moment in human history
when we are, in fact...

131
00:09:13,008 --> 00:09:14,600
...visiting other worlds...

132
00:09:14,809 --> 00:09:19,041
...and engaging in a deep
reconnaissance of the cosmos.

133
00:09:19,414 --> 00:09:22,042
But if we had been born
in a much earlier age...

134
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,344
...no matter how great our dedication,
we couldn't have understood...

135
00:09:25,553 --> 00:09:27,817
...what the stars and planets are.

136
00:09:37,365 --> 00:09:41,859
We would not have known that there
were other suns and other worlds.

137
00:09:45,206 --> 00:09:49,165
This is one of the great secrets
wrested from nature...

138
00:09:49,377 --> 00:09:53,837
...through a million years of patient
observation and courageous thinking.

139
00:09:57,318 --> 00:10:01,118
Human beings have always asked
questions about the stars.

140
00:10:01,322 --> 00:10:04,382
It's as natural as breathing.

141
00:10:04,626 --> 00:10:08,460
But imagine a time before science
had found out the answers.

142
00:10:08,663 --> 00:10:11,257
Imagine what it was like, say...

143
00:10:11,466 --> 00:10:14,993
...hundreds of thousands
of years ago...

144
00:10:15,203 --> 00:10:18,798
...soon after the discovery of fire.

145
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:22,602
We were just as smart
and just as curious then...

146
00:10:22,811 --> 00:10:24,472
...as we are now.

147
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:26,544
Sometimes it seems to me that...

148
00:10:26,748 --> 00:10:29,774
...there were people then
who thought like this:

149
00:10:32,153 --> 00:10:35,714
We are wandering hunter folk.

150
00:10:35,924 --> 00:10:37,585
Fire keeps us warm.

151
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:41,023
Its light makes holes in the darkness.

152
00:10:41,229 --> 00:10:43,493
It keeps hungry animals away.

153
00:10:43,932 --> 00:10:47,424
In the darkness,
we can see each other and talk.

154
00:10:48,603 --> 00:10:50,594
We take care of the flame.

155
00:10:50,805 --> 00:10:53,797
The flame takes care of us.

156
00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:57,007
The stars are not near to us.

157
00:10:57,212 --> 00:11:00,909
When we climb a hill or a tree,
they are no closer.

158
00:11:01,116 --> 00:11:05,052
They flicker with
a strange, cold, white...

159
00:11:05,854 --> 00:11:06,912
...faraway light.

160
00:11:07,856 --> 00:11:12,156
Many of them, all over the sky,
but only at night.

161
00:11:12,527 --> 00:11:14,620
I wonder what they are.

162
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:18,957
One night I thought
the stars are flames.

163
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:22,364
They give a little light
at night as fire does.

164
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,629
Maybe the stars are campfires...

165
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:28,002
...which other wanderers
light at night.

166
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:32,043
The stars give a much
smaller light than campfires...

167
00:11:32,247 --> 00:11:35,045
...so they must be very far away.

168
00:11:35,617 --> 00:11:38,279
I wonder if our campfires...

169
00:11:38,486 --> 00:11:41,250
...look like stars to the people
in the sky.

170
00:11:41,656 --> 00:11:46,150
But why don't those campfires
and the wanderers who made them...

171
00:11:46,361 --> 00:11:48,192
...fall down at our feet?

172
00:11:48,396 --> 00:11:52,594
Why don't strange tribes
drop from the sky?

173
00:11:54,402 --> 00:11:59,169
Those beings in the sky
must have great powers.

174
00:12:06,181 --> 00:12:08,809
I don't suppose
that every hunter-gatherer...

175
00:12:09,017 --> 00:12:11,747
...had such thoughts about the stars.

176
00:12:11,953 --> 00:12:15,389
But we know from contemporary
hunter-gatherer communities...

177
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:19,321
...that very imaginative ideas arise.

178
00:12:19,761 --> 00:12:22,286
The Kung Bushmen...

179
00:12:22,497 --> 00:12:25,557
...of the Kalahari Desert
in the Republic of Botswana...

180
00:12:25,767 --> 00:12:28,497
...have an explanation
of the Milky Way.

181
00:12:28,703 --> 00:12:31,672
At their latitude,
it's often overhead.

182
00:12:31,873 --> 00:12:35,900
They call it the "backbone of night."

183
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:38,738
They believe it holds the sky up.

184
00:12:38,947 --> 00:12:41,279
They believe that if not
for the Milky Way...

185
00:12:41,482 --> 00:12:45,111
...pieces of sky would come crashing
down at our feet.

186
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,949
So the Milky Way, in their view,
has some practical value.

187
00:12:49,157 --> 00:12:51,682
The backbone of night.

188
00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:57,225
Later on, metaphors about...

189
00:12:57,498 --> 00:12:59,989
...campfires or backbones...

190
00:13:00,201 --> 00:13:03,500
...or holes through which
the flame could be seen...

191
00:13:03,705 --> 00:13:08,074
...were replaced in most human
communities by another idea.

192
00:13:08,543 --> 00:13:13,412
The powerful beings in the sky
were promoted to gods.

193
00:13:14,048 --> 00:13:17,142
They were given names and relatives...

194
00:13:17,352 --> 00:13:19,286
...and special responsibilities...

195
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,854
...for the cosmic services they were
expected to perform.

196
00:13:23,057 --> 00:13:26,925
There was a god
for every human concern.

197
00:13:27,128 --> 00:13:28,186
Gods ran nature.

198
00:13:28,396 --> 00:13:32,833
Nothing happened without the direct
intervention of some god.

199
00:13:33,134 --> 00:13:36,592
If the gods were happy,
there was plenty of food...

200
00:13:36,804 --> 00:13:38,362
...and humans were happy.

201
00:13:40,174 --> 00:13:42,938
But if something
displeased the gods...

202
00:13:43,144 --> 00:13:47,444
...and it didn't take much,
the consequences were awesome:

203
00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:50,880
Droughts, floods, storms, wars...

204
00:13:51,085 --> 00:13:54,714
...earthquakes, volcanic eruptions,
epidemics.

205
00:13:55,623 --> 00:13:58,649
The gods had to be propitiated.

206
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,522
And a vast industry
of priests arose...

207
00:14:01,729 --> 00:14:04,254
...to make the gods less angry.

208
00:14:04,866 --> 00:14:07,926
But because the gods
were capricious...

209
00:14:08,136 --> 00:14:10,627
...you couldn't be sure
what they would do.

210
00:14:10,838 --> 00:14:13,272
Nature was a mystery.

211
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:16,066
It was hard to understand the world.

212
00:14:19,113 --> 00:14:22,276
Our ancestors groped in darkness...

213
00:14:22,483 --> 00:14:24,781
...to make sense
of their surroundings.

214
00:14:24,986 --> 00:14:26,476
Powerless before nature...

215
00:14:27,155 --> 00:14:29,715
...they invented rituals and myths...

216
00:14:29,924 --> 00:14:32,484
...some desperate and cruel...

217
00:14:32,694 --> 00:14:36,357
...others imaginative and benign.

218
00:14:36,698 --> 00:14:38,928
The ancient Greeks explained...

219
00:14:39,133 --> 00:14:42,591
...that diffuse band of brightness
in the night sky...

220
00:14:42,804 --> 00:14:45,466
...as the milk of the goddess Hera...

221
00:14:45,673 --> 00:14:48,642
...squirted from her breast
across the heavens.

222
00:14:48,843 --> 00:14:52,279
We still call it the Milky Way.

223
00:14:58,786 --> 00:15:01,778
In gratitude for the many gifts
of the gods...

224
00:15:01,989 --> 00:15:06,119
...our ancestors created works
of surpassing beauty.

225
00:15:09,063 --> 00:15:11,554
This is all that remains...

226
00:15:11,766 --> 00:15:15,167
...of the ancient temple of Hera,
queen of heaven:

227
00:15:15,536 --> 00:15:20,405
A single marble column standing
in a vast field of ruins...

228
00:15:21,109 --> 00:15:23,100
...on the Greek island of Samos.

229
00:15:23,311 --> 00:15:25,279
It was one of the wonders
of the world...

230
00:15:25,747 --> 00:15:30,207
...built by people with
an extraordinary eye for clarity...

231
00:15:30,418 --> 00:15:31,976
...and symmetry.

232
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,692
Those who thronged to that temple...

233
00:15:41,896 --> 00:15:44,490
...were also the architects
of a bridge...

234
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:47,497
...from their world to ours.

235
00:15:50,104 --> 00:15:54,598
We were moving once again
in our voyage of self-discovery...

236
00:15:54,876 --> 00:15:57,504
...on our journey to the stars.

237
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:06,147
Here, 25 centuries ago...

238
00:16:06,788 --> 00:16:10,155
...on the island of Samos
and in the other Greek colonies...

239
00:16:10,358 --> 00:16:12,918
...which had grown up
in the busy Aegean Sea...

240
00:16:13,127 --> 00:16:15,721
...there was a glorious awakening.

241
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:19,491
Suddenly, people believed
that everything was made of atoms...

242
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:23,966
...that human beings and other animals
had evolved from simpler forms...

243
00:16:24,172 --> 00:16:28,802
...that diseases were not caused by
demons or the gods...

244
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:33,310
...that the Earth was only
a planet going around a sun...

245
00:16:33,514 --> 00:16:35,880
...which was very far away.

246
00:16:39,454 --> 00:16:43,550
This revolution made cosmos
out of chaos.

247
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:47,291
Here, in the sixth century B.C.,
a new idea developed...

248
00:16:47,495 --> 00:16:50,157
...one of the great ideas
of the human species.

249
00:16:50,364 --> 00:16:54,425
It was argued that the universe
was knowable.

250
00:16:54,735 --> 00:16:57,397
Why? Because it was ordered.

251
00:16:57,605 --> 00:17:00,165
Because there are regularities
in nature...

252
00:17:00,374 --> 00:17:03,207
...which permitted secrets
to be uncovered.

253
00:17:05,446 --> 00:17:08,847
Nature was not entirely unpredictable.

254
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:12,781
There were rules which even
she had to obey.

255
00:17:15,323 --> 00:17:19,987
This ordered and admirable character
of the universe...

256
00:17:20,194 --> 00:17:22,185
...was called cosmos.

257
00:17:23,364 --> 00:17:26,094
And it was set
in stark contradiction...

258
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,530
...to the idea of chaos.

259
00:17:29,403 --> 00:17:33,669
This was the first conflict
of which we know...

260
00:17:34,108 --> 00:17:36,338
...between science and mysticism...

261
00:17:37,144 --> 00:17:39,874
...between nature and the gods.

262
00:17:45,686 --> 00:17:47,654
But why here?

263
00:17:48,256 --> 00:17:52,693
Why in these remote islands and inlets
of the eastern Mediterranean?

264
00:17:52,894 --> 00:17:55,192
Why not in the great cities of...

265
00:17:55,396 --> 00:18:00,060
...India or Egypt, Babylon,
China, Mesoamerica?

266
00:18:02,737 --> 00:18:06,036
Because they were all
at the center of old empires.

267
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:12,136
They were set in their ways,
hostile to new ideas.

268
00:18:12,346 --> 00:18:14,109
But here in Ionia...

269
00:18:14,315 --> 00:18:18,217
...were a multitude of newly colonized
islands and city-states.

270
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:22,753
Isolation, even if incomplete,
promotes diversity.

271
00:18:22,957 --> 00:18:27,121
No single concentration of power
could enforce conformity.

272
00:18:27,328 --> 00:18:30,263
Free inquiry became possible.

273
00:18:31,165 --> 00:18:34,498
They were beyond the frontiers
of the empires.

274
00:18:34,702 --> 00:18:38,194
The merchants and tourists
and sailors of Africa...

275
00:18:38,406 --> 00:18:41,466
...Asia and Europe
met in the harbors of Ionia...

276
00:18:42,343 --> 00:18:46,143
...to exchange goods
and stories and ideas.

277
00:18:46,347 --> 00:18:49,612
There was a vigorous and heady
interaction...

278
00:18:49,817 --> 00:18:54,618
...of many traditions, prejudices,
languages and gods.

279
00:19:04,465 --> 00:19:07,866
These people were ready to experiment.

280
00:19:08,436 --> 00:19:11,530
Once you are open to
questioning rituals...

281
00:19:11,739 --> 00:19:13,707
...and time-honored practices...

282
00:19:13,908 --> 00:19:18,311
...you find that one question
leads to another.

283
00:19:28,022 --> 00:19:31,150
What do you do when you're faced
with several different gods...

284
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:33,759
...each claiming the same territory?

285
00:19:33,961 --> 00:19:36,521
The Babylonian Marduk
and the Greek Zeus...

286
00:19:36,731 --> 00:19:40,189
...were each considered
king of the gods...

287
00:19:40,401 --> 00:19:42,335
...master of the sky.

288
00:19:42,803 --> 00:19:46,170
You might decide, since they otherwise
had different attributes...

289
00:19:46,374 --> 00:19:49,138
...that one of them was merely
invented by the priests.

290
00:19:49,343 --> 00:19:52,005
But if one, why not both?

291
00:19:57,785 --> 00:20:00,811
And so it was here
that the great idea arose:

292
00:20:01,022 --> 00:20:03,047
The realization that there
might be a way...

293
00:20:03,257 --> 00:20:05,851
...to know the world
without the god hypothesis.

294
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:10,827
That there be principles,
forces, laws of nature...

295
00:20:11,032 --> 00:20:14,524
...through which the world might be
understood without attributing...

296
00:20:14,735 --> 00:20:18,796
...the fall of every sparrow to
the direct intervention of Zeus.

297
00:20:19,206 --> 00:20:22,403
This is the place
where science was born.

298
00:20:22,777 --> 00:20:24,608
That's why we're here.

299
00:20:26,147 --> 00:20:31,084
This Greek revolution happened
between 600 and 400 B.C.

300
00:20:31,752 --> 00:20:34,915
It was accomplished by the same
practical and productive people...

301
00:20:35,122 --> 00:20:36,953
...who made the society function.

302
00:20:37,158 --> 00:20:40,252
Political power was in the hands
of the merchants...

303
00:20:40,461 --> 00:20:43,692
...who promoted the technology
on which their prosperity depended.

304
00:20:44,098 --> 00:20:46,259
The earliest pioneers
of science were...

305
00:20:46,467 --> 00:20:49,630
...merchants and artisans
and their children.

306
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:59,211
The first Ionian scientist was
named Thales.

307
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,444
He was born over there
in the city of Miletus...

308
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,948
...across this narrow strait.

309
00:21:05,152 --> 00:21:06,915
He had traveled in Egypt...

310
00:21:07,121 --> 00:21:09,954
...and was conversant
with the knowledge of Babylon.

311
00:21:10,391 --> 00:21:14,885
Like the Babylonians, he believed
that the world had once all been water.

312
00:21:15,529 --> 00:21:17,622
To explain the dry land...

313
00:21:17,832 --> 00:21:20,995
...the Babylonians added
that their god, Marduk...

314
00:21:21,202 --> 00:21:24,797
...had placed a mat on the face
of the waters...

315
00:21:25,005 --> 00:21:27,303
...and piled dirt on top of it.

316
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:30,504
Thales had a similar view...

317
00:21:30,711 --> 00:21:33,612
...but he left Marduk out.

318
00:21:34,415 --> 00:21:37,714
Yes, the world had once been
mostly water...

319
00:21:38,219 --> 00:21:42,747
...but it was a natural process
which explained the dry land.

320
00:21:42,957 --> 00:21:47,189
Thales thought it was similar to
the silting up he had observed...

321
00:21:47,394 --> 00:21:49,885
...at the delta of the river Nile.

322
00:21:51,132 --> 00:21:54,795
Whether Thales' conclusions
were right or wrong...

323
00:21:55,002 --> 00:21:58,460
...is not nearly as important
as his approach.

324
00:21:58,672 --> 00:22:02,199
The world was not made by the gods...

325
00:22:02,409 --> 00:22:05,572
...but instead was the result
of material forces...

326
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,680
...interacting in nature.

327
00:22:08,282 --> 00:22:12,116
Thales brought back from
Babylon and Egypt...

328
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:15,550
...the seeds of new sciences:

329
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:18,190
Astronomy and geometry...

330
00:22:18,392 --> 00:22:21,190
...sciences which would
sprout and grow...

331
00:22:21,395 --> 00:22:24,421
...in the fertile soil of Ionia.

332
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,902
Anaximander of Miletus, over there...

333
00:22:30,337 --> 00:22:32,601
...was a friend and colleague
of Thales...

334
00:22:32,807 --> 00:22:34,968
...one of the first people
that we know of...

335
00:22:35,176 --> 00:22:37,406
...to have actually done
an experiment.

336
00:22:37,611 --> 00:22:42,139
By examining the moving shadow
cast by a vertical stick...

337
00:22:42,349 --> 00:22:46,877
...he determined accurately
the lengths of the year and seasons.

338
00:22:47,087 --> 00:22:50,318
For ages, men had used sticks...

339
00:22:50,524 --> 00:22:52,583
...to club and spear each other.

340
00:22:52,793 --> 00:22:56,320
Anaximander used a stick
to measure time.

341
00:23:00,801 --> 00:23:05,397
In 540 B.C., or thereabouts,
on this island of Samos...

342
00:23:05,606 --> 00:23:10,134
...there came to power a tyrant
named Polycrates.

343
00:23:10,411 --> 00:23:12,436
He seems to have started
as a caterer...

344
00:23:12,646 --> 00:23:15,547
...and then went on to
international piracy.

345
00:23:15,883 --> 00:23:20,411
His loot was unloaded
on this very breakwater.

346
00:23:20,621 --> 00:23:23,112
(DRUM BEATS)

347
00:23:28,996 --> 00:23:33,057
But he oppressed his own people,
he made war on his neighbors.

348
00:23:33,267 --> 00:23:35,394
He quite rightly feared invasion.

349
00:23:35,603 --> 00:23:40,506
So Polycrates surrounded his capital
city with an impressive wall...

350
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:43,643
...whose remains stand till this day.

351
00:23:53,053 --> 00:23:57,012
To carry water from a distant spring
through the fortifications...

352
00:23:57,224 --> 00:24:00,022
...he ordered this great tunnel built.

353
00:24:00,227 --> 00:24:03,719
A kilometer long,
it pierces a mountain.

354
00:24:03,998 --> 00:24:06,330
Two cuttings were dug
from either side...

355
00:24:06,533 --> 00:24:08,797
...which met almost perfectly
in the middle.

356
00:24:09,003 --> 00:24:12,234
The project took some 1 5 years
to complete.

357
00:24:13,173 --> 00:24:16,734
It is a token of the civil engineering
of its day...

358
00:24:16,944 --> 00:24:20,778
...and an indication of the
extraordinary practical capability...

359
00:24:20,981 --> 00:24:21,879
...of the Ionians.

360
00:24:25,185 --> 00:24:27,483
The enduring legacy of the Ionians...

361
00:24:27,688 --> 00:24:30,122
...is the tools and techniques
they developed...

362
00:24:30,324 --> 00:24:33,589
...which remain the basis
of modern technology.

363
00:24:37,765 --> 00:24:40,996
This was the time of Theodorus...

364
00:24:41,201 --> 00:24:43,931
...the master engineer of the age...

365
00:24:44,138 --> 00:24:48,131
...a man who is credited with
the invention of...

366
00:24:48,342 --> 00:24:52,301
...the key, the ruler,
the carpenter's square...

367
00:24:52,513 --> 00:24:55,380
...the level, the lathe,
bronze casting.

368
00:24:55,883 --> 00:24:58,852
Why are there no monuments
to this man?

369
00:24:59,853 --> 00:25:03,345
Those who dreamt and speculated...

370
00:25:03,557 --> 00:25:05,957
...and deduced about
the laws of nature...

371
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,628
...talked to the engineers
and the technologists.

372
00:25:08,829 --> 00:25:10,854
They were often the same people.

373
00:25:11,231 --> 00:25:15,190
The practical and the theoretical
were one.

374
00:25:16,236 --> 00:25:21,173
(DRUM BEATS)

375
00:25:22,042 --> 00:25:25,705
This new hybrid of abstract thought...

376
00:25:25,913 --> 00:25:29,314
...and everyday experience
blossomed into science.

377
00:25:30,684 --> 00:25:34,814
When these practical men turned
their attention to the natural world...

378
00:25:35,022 --> 00:25:37,149
...they began to uncover
hidden wonders...

379
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:40,685
...and breathtaking possibilities.

380
00:25:41,328 --> 00:25:44,786
Anaximander studied the profusion
of living things...

381
00:25:44,999 --> 00:25:47,524
...and saw their interrelationships.

382
00:25:47,735 --> 00:25:51,865
He concluded that life had originated
in water and mud...

383
00:25:52,339 --> 00:25:55,069
...and then colonized the dry land.

384
00:25:55,909 --> 00:25:57,740
"Human beings," he said...

385
00:25:57,945 --> 00:26:00,846
"...must have evolved
from simpler forms."

386
00:26:01,348 --> 00:26:06,285
This insight had to wait 24 centuries
until its truth was demonstrated...

387
00:26:06,887 --> 00:26:08,650
...by Charles Darwin.

388
00:26:17,264 --> 00:26:21,462
Nothing was excluded from the
investigations of the first scientists.

389
00:26:21,668 --> 00:26:25,968
Even the air became the subject
of close examination...

390
00:26:26,173 --> 00:26:30,166
...by a Greek from Sicily
named Empedocles.

391
00:26:31,812 --> 00:26:34,372
He made an astonishing discovery...

392
00:26:34,581 --> 00:26:39,018
...with a household implement
that people had used for centuries.

393
00:26:39,353 --> 00:26:42,516
This is the so-called
water thief.

394
00:26:42,723 --> 00:26:46,921
It's a brazen sphere with a neck
and a hole at the top...

395
00:26:47,127 --> 00:26:49,687
...and a set of little holes
at the bottom.

396
00:26:49,897 --> 00:26:51,558
It was used as a kitchen ladle.

397
00:26:52,099 --> 00:26:55,796
You fill it by immersing it in water.

398
00:26:58,305 --> 00:27:00,603
lf, after it's been in there
a little bit...

399
00:27:00,808 --> 00:27:03,971
...you pull it out
with the neck uncovered...

400
00:27:05,245 --> 00:27:09,045
...then the water trickles out
the little holes making a small shower.

401
00:27:10,184 --> 00:27:13,813
Instead, if you pull it out
with the neck covered...

402
00:27:14,588 --> 00:27:16,215
...the water is retained.

403
00:27:28,035 --> 00:27:30,128
Now try to fill it...

404
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:33,828
...with the neck covered
with my thumb.

405
00:27:37,945 --> 00:27:39,071
Nothing happens.

406
00:27:39,947 --> 00:27:41,073
Why not?

407
00:27:41,648 --> 00:27:43,445
There's something in the way.

408
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:48,587
Some material is blocking the access
of the water into the sphere.

409
00:27:48,922 --> 00:27:51,117
I can't see any such material.

410
00:27:51,992 --> 00:27:53,619
What could it be?

411
00:27:54,361 --> 00:27:56,852
Empedocles identified it...

412
00:27:57,064 --> 00:27:58,463
...as air.

413
00:27:59,099 --> 00:28:00,862
What else could it be?

414
00:28:01,235 --> 00:28:04,363
A thing you can't see
can exert pressure...

415
00:28:04,571 --> 00:28:08,371
...can frustrate my wish to fill
this vessel with water...

416
00:28:08,575 --> 00:28:12,841
...if I were dumb enough to
leave my thumb on the neck.

417
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:17,343
Empedocles had discovered...

418
00:28:18,685 --> 00:28:20,175
...the invisible.

419
00:28:20,787 --> 00:28:23,779
Air, he thought, must be matter...

420
00:28:23,991 --> 00:28:27,358
...in a form so finely divided...

421
00:28:28,228 --> 00:28:29,593
...that it couldn't be seen.

422
00:28:31,064 --> 00:28:35,467
This hint, this whiff
of the existence of atoms...

423
00:28:35,669 --> 00:28:40,038
...was carried much further by
a contemporary named Democritus.

424
00:28:40,507 --> 00:28:44,773
Of all the ancient scientists, it is
he who speaks most clearly to us...

425
00:28:44,978 --> 00:28:46,502
...across the centuries.

426
00:28:46,713 --> 00:28:49,944
The few surviving fragments
of his scientific writings...

427
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:53,779
...reveal a mind of the highest
logical and intuitive powers.

428
00:28:53,987 --> 00:28:58,788
He believed that a large number of
other worlds wander through space...

429
00:28:58,992 --> 00:29:01,290
...that worlds are born and die...

430
00:29:01,495 --> 00:29:03,486
...that some are
rich and living creatures...

431
00:29:03,697 --> 00:29:06,928
...and others are dry and barren.

432
00:29:08,302 --> 00:29:11,135
He was the first to understand
that the Milky Way...

433
00:29:11,338 --> 00:29:14,933
...is an aggregate of the light
of innumerable faint stars.

434
00:29:15,142 --> 00:29:19,010
Beyond campfires in the sky,
beyond the milk of Hera...

435
00:29:19,213 --> 00:29:24,150
...beyond the backbone of night,
the mind of Democritus soared.

436
00:29:29,423 --> 00:29:32,654
He saw deep connections between
the heavens and the Earth.

437
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:36,195
"Man," he said, "is a microcosm...

438
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:38,222
...a little cosmos."

439
00:30:02,055 --> 00:30:05,991
Democritus came from
the Ionian town of Abdera...

440
00:30:06,193 --> 00:30:08,491
...on the northern Aegean shore.

441
00:30:11,832 --> 00:30:16,166
In those days, Abdera was
the butt of jokes.

442
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:19,163
lf, around the year 400 B.C...

443
00:30:19,373 --> 00:30:21,841
...in the equivalent
of a restaurant like this...

444
00:30:22,409 --> 00:30:25,037
...you told a story about
someone from Abdera...

445
00:30:25,245 --> 00:30:27,179
...you were guaranteed a laugh.

446
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:32,018
It was, in a way...

447
00:30:32,219 --> 00:30:34,619
...the Brooklyn of its time.

448
00:30:37,124 --> 00:30:41,322
For Democritus, all of life was to be
enjoyed and understood.

449
00:30:41,528 --> 00:30:43,826
For him, understanding and enjoyment...

450
00:30:44,031 --> 00:30:46,329
...were pretty much the same thing.

451
00:30:46,533 --> 00:30:51,163
He said, "A life without festivity is
a long road without an inn."

452
00:30:51,371 --> 00:30:55,068
Democritus may have come from Abdera,
but he was no dummy.

453
00:30:58,879 --> 00:31:01,871
Democritus understood
that the complex forms...

454
00:31:02,082 --> 00:31:05,483
...changes and motions
of the material world...

455
00:31:05,686 --> 00:31:10,248
...all derived from the interaction
of very simple moving parts.

456
00:31:10,457 --> 00:31:13,153
He called these parts atoms.

457
00:31:18,131 --> 00:31:21,828
All material objects are
collections of atoms...

458
00:31:22,369 --> 00:31:23,802
...intricately assembled...

459
00:31:24,004 --> 00:31:25,301
...even we.

460
00:31:25,539 --> 00:31:27,803
When I cut this apple...

461
00:31:28,075 --> 00:31:30,100
...the knife must be
passing through...

462
00:31:30,377 --> 00:31:33,869
...empty spaces between the atoms,
Democritus argued.

463
00:31:34,081 --> 00:31:37,517
If there were no such empty spaces,
no void...

464
00:31:37,718 --> 00:31:42,280
...then the knife would encounter
some impenetrable atom...

465
00:31:42,489 --> 00:31:44,423
...and the apple wouldn't be cut.

466
00:31:44,624 --> 00:31:47,718
Let's compare the cross sections
of the two pieces.

467
00:31:47,928 --> 00:31:50,522
Are the exposed areas exactly equal?

468
00:31:50,731 --> 00:31:53,461
No, said Democritus,
the curvature of the apple...

469
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:58,468
...forces this slice to be slightly
shorter than the rest of the apple.

470
00:31:58,872 --> 00:32:02,239
If they were equally tall,
then we'd have...

471
00:32:02,442 --> 00:32:04,501
...a cylinder and not an apple.

472
00:32:04,745 --> 00:32:06,872
No matter how sharp the knife...

473
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,947
...these two pieces have
unequal cross sections.

474
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:11,515
But why?

475
00:32:11,718 --> 00:32:14,744
Because on the scale
of the very small...

476
00:32:14,955 --> 00:32:18,220
...matter exhibits some
irreducible roughness...

477
00:32:18,425 --> 00:32:22,156
...and this fine scale of roughness
Democritus of Abdera identified...

478
00:32:22,429 --> 00:32:24,363
...with the world of the atoms.

479
00:32:24,564 --> 00:32:26,725
His arguments are not those
we use today.

480
00:32:26,933 --> 00:32:31,233
But they're elegant and subtle
and derived from everyday experience.

481
00:32:31,438 --> 00:32:34,874
And his conclusions were
fundamentally right.

482
00:32:40,147 --> 00:32:43,241
Democritus believed that nothing
happens at random...

483
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:46,715
...that everything has
a material cause.

484
00:32:48,054 --> 00:32:51,990
He said, "I would rather understand
one cause...

485
00:32:52,192 --> 00:32:54,456
...than be king of Persia."

486
00:32:54,661 --> 00:32:57,892
He believed that poverty
in a democracy was far better...

487
00:32:58,098 --> 00:32:59,725
...than wealth in a tyranny.

488
00:32:59,933 --> 00:33:03,425
He believed that the prevailing
religions of his time were evil...

489
00:33:03,637 --> 00:33:07,664
...and that neither souls
nor immortal gods existed.

490
00:33:08,275 --> 00:33:13,212
There is no evidence that Democritus
was persecuted for his beliefs.

491
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:16,772
But then again, he came from Abdera.

492
00:33:19,052 --> 00:33:20,383
However, in his time...

493
00:33:20,587 --> 00:33:24,023
...the brief tradition of tolerance
for unconventional views...

494
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:26,192
...was beginning to erode.

495
00:33:26,693 --> 00:33:29,218
For instance,
the prevailing belief was...

496
00:33:29,429 --> 00:33:32,193
...that the moon and the sun
were gods.

497
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:36,599
Another contemporary of Democritus,
named Anaxagoras, taught...

498
00:33:36,803 --> 00:33:40,569
...that the moon was a place
made of ordinary matter...

499
00:33:40,774 --> 00:33:45,006
...and that the sun was a red-hot stone
far away in the sky.

500
00:33:45,245 --> 00:33:48,339
For this, Anaxagoras was condemned...

501
00:33:48,548 --> 00:33:52,143
...convicted and imprisoned
for impiety...

502
00:33:52,352 --> 00:33:54,115
...a religious crime.

503
00:33:54,321 --> 00:33:57,916
People began to be persecuted
for their ideas.

504
00:33:58,225 --> 00:34:00,887
A portrait of Democritus is now...

505
00:34:01,094 --> 00:34:03,790
...on the Greek 100-drachma note.

506
00:34:04,664 --> 00:34:06,825
But his ideas were suppressed...

507
00:34:07,033 --> 00:34:09,228
...and his influence on history
made minor.

508
00:34:09,436 --> 00:34:12,132
The mystics were beginning to win.

509
00:34:12,339 --> 00:34:16,469
(DRUM BEATS)

510
00:34:18,945 --> 00:34:21,539
You see, Ionia was also the home...

511
00:34:21,748 --> 00:34:24,581
...of another quite different
intellectual tradition.

512
00:34:24,784 --> 00:34:27,412
Its founder was Pythagoras...

513
00:34:27,621 --> 00:34:31,022
...who lived here on Samos
in the 6th century B.C.

514
00:34:32,225 --> 00:34:34,523
According to local legend...

515
00:34:34,728 --> 00:34:38,289
...this cave was once his abode.

516
00:34:38,632 --> 00:34:41,157
Maybe that was once his living room.

517
00:34:41,368 --> 00:34:43,336
Many centuries later...

518
00:34:43,603 --> 00:34:47,369
...this small Greek Orthodox shrine
was erected on his front porch.

519
00:34:47,574 --> 00:34:52,511
There's a continuity of tradition
from Pythagoras to Christianity.

520
00:34:52,746 --> 00:34:56,409
Pythagoras was the first person
in the history of the world...

521
00:34:56,616 --> 00:34:59,744
...to decide that the Earth
was a sphere.

522
00:34:59,986 --> 00:35:04,184
Perhaps he argued by analogy
with the moon or the sun...

523
00:35:04,391 --> 00:35:07,417
...maybe he noticed the curved shadow
of the Earth on the moon...

524
00:35:07,627 --> 00:35:09,219
...during a lunar eclipse.

525
00:35:09,429 --> 00:35:12,227
Or maybe he recognized
that when ships leave Samos...

526
00:35:12,432 --> 00:35:14,866
...their masts disappear last.

527
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:23,632
Pythagoras believed that
a mathematical harmony...

528
00:35:23,843 --> 00:35:25,708
...underlies all of nature.

529
00:35:25,912 --> 00:35:28,176
The modern tradition
of mathematical argument...

530
00:35:28,381 --> 00:35:31,748
...essential in all of science
owes much to him.

531
00:35:31,952 --> 00:35:35,718
And the notion that the heavenly bodies
move to a kind of...

532
00:35:35,922 --> 00:35:38,152
...music of the spheres...

533
00:35:38,458 --> 00:35:40,983
...was also derived from Pythagoras.

534
00:35:41,595 --> 00:35:44,462
It was he who first used
the word cosmos...

535
00:35:44,664 --> 00:35:47,497
...to mean a well-ordered
and harmonious universe...

536
00:35:47,701 --> 00:35:51,193
...a world amenable
to human understanding.

537
00:35:55,575 --> 00:35:59,011
For this great idea,
we are indebted to Pythagoras.

538
00:35:59,212 --> 00:36:03,740
But there were deep ironies
and contradictions in his thoughts.

539
00:36:04,217 --> 00:36:06,117
Many of the Ionians believed...

540
00:36:06,319 --> 00:36:10,813
...that the underlying harmony and
unity of the universe was accessible...

541
00:36:11,024 --> 00:36:13,720
...through observation
and experiment...

542
00:36:13,927 --> 00:36:16,395
...the method which dominates
science today.

543
00:36:16,663 --> 00:36:19,427
However, Pythagoras had
a very different method.

544
00:36:19,633 --> 00:36:24,570
He believed that the laws of nature
can be deduced by pure thought.

545
00:36:24,971 --> 00:36:28,031
He and his followers were not
basically experimentalists...

546
00:36:28,241 --> 00:36:30,038
...they were mathematicians...

547
00:36:30,243 --> 00:36:33,110
...and they were
thoroughgoing mystics.

548
00:36:34,014 --> 00:36:37,950
They were fascinated by these
five regular solids...

549
00:36:38,151 --> 00:36:41,450
...bodies whose faces
are all polygons:

550
00:36:41,655 --> 00:36:44,283
Triangles or squares...

551
00:36:44,491 --> 00:36:45,890
...or pentagons.

552
00:36:46,092 --> 00:36:48,856
There can be an infinite number
of polygons...

553
00:36:49,062 --> 00:36:52,088
...but only five regular solids.

554
00:36:54,668 --> 00:36:59,605
Four of the solids were associated
with earth, fire, air and water.

555
00:37:00,273 --> 00:37:03,868
The cube, for example,
represented earth.

556
00:37:04,077 --> 00:37:08,173
These four elements, they thought,
make up terrestrial matter.

557
00:37:09,549 --> 00:37:11,346
So the fifth solid...

558
00:37:11,551 --> 00:37:14,782
...they mystically associated
with the cosmos.

559
00:37:14,988 --> 00:37:17,889
Perhaps it was the substance
of the heavens.

560
00:37:18,091 --> 00:37:20,651
This fifth solid was called...

561
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:23,328
...the dodecahedron.

562
00:37:23,697 --> 00:37:27,189
Its faces are pentagons, 1 2 of them.

563
00:37:27,801 --> 00:37:29,530
Knowledge of the dodecahedron...

564
00:37:29,736 --> 00:37:33,001
...was considered too dangerous
for the public.

565
00:37:35,241 --> 00:37:39,701
Ordinary people were to be
kept ignorant of the dodecahedron.

566
00:37:39,946 --> 00:37:42,779
In love with whole numbers,
the Pythagoreans believed...

567
00:37:42,982 --> 00:37:45,143
...that all things could be
derived from them...

568
00:37:45,351 --> 00:37:47,342
...certainly all other numbers.

569
00:37:47,554 --> 00:37:50,580
So a crisis in doctrine occurred
when they discovered...

570
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:53,224
...that the square root of two
was irrational.

571
00:37:53,426 --> 00:37:56,554
The square root of two could
not be represented as the ratio...

572
00:37:56,763 --> 00:37:59,459
...of two whole numbers
no matter how big they were.

573
00:37:59,833 --> 00:38:02,529
Irrational originally meant
only that...

574
00:38:02,736 --> 00:38:05,705
...that you can't express a number
as a ratio.

575
00:38:05,905 --> 00:38:09,102
But for the Pythagoreans,
it came to mean something else...

576
00:38:09,309 --> 00:38:11,209
...something threatening...

577
00:38:11,411 --> 00:38:15,507
...a hint that their world-view
might not make sense...

578
00:38:15,715 --> 00:38:18,548
...the other meaning of irrational.

579
00:38:19,452 --> 00:38:24,116
Instead of wanting everyone to share
and know of their discoveries...

580
00:38:24,324 --> 00:38:27,521
...the Pythagoreans suppressed
the square root of two...

581
00:38:27,727 --> 00:38:29,388
...and the dodecahedron.

582
00:38:29,596 --> 00:38:32,087
The outside world was not to know.

583
00:38:38,004 --> 00:38:40,268
The Pythagoreans had discovered...

584
00:38:40,473 --> 00:38:43,101
...in the mathematical underpinnings
of nature...

585
00:38:43,309 --> 00:38:45,937
...one of the two most
powerful scientific tools.

586
00:38:46,146 --> 00:38:49,240
The other, of course, is experiment.

587
00:38:49,549 --> 00:38:52,109
But instead of using their insight
to advance...

588
00:38:52,318 --> 00:38:54,980
...the collective voyage
of human discovery...

589
00:38:55,188 --> 00:38:59,750
...they made of it little more
than the hocus-pocus of a mystery cult.

590
00:38:59,959 --> 00:39:03,053
Science and mathematics were to be
removed from the hands...

591
00:39:03,263 --> 00:39:04,890
...of merchants and artisans.

592
00:39:05,832 --> 00:39:08,767
This tendency found its most
effective advocate...

593
00:39:08,968 --> 00:39:12,335
...in a follower of Pythagoras
named Plato.

594
00:39:12,605 --> 00:39:17,304
He preferred the perfection
of these mathematical abstractions...

595
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:20,638
...to the imperfections
of everyday life.

596
00:39:20,847 --> 00:39:25,181
He believed that ideas were far more
real than the natural world.

597
00:39:25,385 --> 00:39:28,013
He advised the astronomers
not to waste their time...

598
00:39:28,221 --> 00:39:29,950
...observing stars and planets.

599
00:39:30,156 --> 00:39:33,717
It was better, he believed,
just to think about them.

600
00:39:34,561 --> 00:39:38,156
Plato expressed hostility to
observation and experiment.

601
00:39:38,364 --> 00:39:40,798
He taught contempt
for the real world...

602
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,993
...and disdain for the practical
application of scientific knowledge.

603
00:39:46,673 --> 00:39:50,404
Plato's followers succeeded
in extinguishing the light...

604
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:52,441
...of science and experiment...

605
00:39:52,645 --> 00:39:56,945
...that had been kindled
by Democritus and the other Ionians.

606
00:39:59,786 --> 00:40:03,187
Plato's unease with the world
as revealed by our senses...

607
00:40:03,389 --> 00:40:08,122
...was to dominate
and stifle Western philosophy.

608
00:40:10,563 --> 00:40:12,360
Even as late as 1600...

609
00:40:12,565 --> 00:40:15,932
...Johannes Kepler was still
struggling to interpret...

610
00:40:16,135 --> 00:40:18,228
...the structure of
the cosmos in terms of...

611
00:40:18,438 --> 00:40:22,875
...Pythagorean solids
and Platonic perfection.

612
00:40:23,076 --> 00:40:27,012
Ironically, it was Kepler who helped
re-establish the old Ionian method...

613
00:40:27,213 --> 00:40:29,647
...of testing ideas
against observations.

614
00:40:30,183 --> 00:40:33,016
But why had science lost its way
in the first place?

615
00:40:33,219 --> 00:40:36,154
What appeal did Pythagoras'
and Plato's teachings...

616
00:40:36,356 --> 00:40:38,221
...have for their contemporaries?

617
00:40:38,424 --> 00:40:40,051
They provided, I believe...

618
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:43,195
...an intellectually
respectable justification...

619
00:40:43,396 --> 00:40:46,263
...for a corrupt social order.

620
00:40:49,836 --> 00:40:53,033
The mercantile tradition which had
led to Ionian science...

621
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:55,503
...also led to a slave economy.

622
00:40:56,376 --> 00:40:58,367
You could get richer...

623
00:40:58,578 --> 00:41:01,138
...if you owned a lot of slaves.

624
00:41:01,514 --> 00:41:04,506
Athens, in the time
of Plato and Aristotle...

625
00:41:04,717 --> 00:41:07,481
...had a vast slave population.

626
00:41:07,687 --> 00:41:11,589
All of that brave Athenian talk
about democracy...

627
00:41:11,791 --> 00:41:14,692
...applied only to a privileged few.

628
00:41:15,295 --> 00:41:19,629
Plato and Aristotle were comfortable
in a slave society.

629
00:41:19,832 --> 00:41:22,926
They offered justifications
for oppression.

630
00:41:23,569 --> 00:41:25,537
They served tyrants.

631
00:41:25,738 --> 00:41:28,901
They taught the alienation
of the body from the mind...

632
00:41:29,108 --> 00:41:33,135
...a natural enough idea, I suppose,
in a slave society.

633
00:41:33,346 --> 00:41:35,871
They separated thought from matter.

634
00:41:36,082 --> 00:41:38,448
They divorced the Earth
from the heavens.

635
00:41:38,651 --> 00:41:42,519
Divisions which were to dominate
Western thinking...

636
00:41:42,722 --> 00:41:44,815
...for more than 20 centuries.

637
00:41:45,024 --> 00:41:47,458
The Pythagoreans had won.

638
00:41:53,633 --> 00:41:56,659
In the recognition by
Pythagoras and Plato...

639
00:41:56,869 --> 00:41:58,837
...that the cosmos is knowable...

640
00:41:59,038 --> 00:42:02,132
...that there is a mathematical
underpinning to nature...

641
00:42:02,342 --> 00:42:05,436
...they greatly advanced
the cause of science.

642
00:42:06,045 --> 00:42:10,106
But in the suppression
of disquieting facts...

643
00:42:10,316 --> 00:42:15,015
...the sense that science should be
kept for a small elite...

644
00:42:15,221 --> 00:42:19,282
...the distaste for experiment,
the embrace of mysticism...

645
00:42:19,926 --> 00:42:23,259
...the easy acceptance
of slave societies...

646
00:42:23,463 --> 00:42:27,331
...their influence has
significantly set back...

647
00:42:27,533 --> 00:42:29,160
...the human endeavor.

648
00:42:30,536 --> 00:42:35,473
The books of the Ionian scientists
are entirely lost.

649
00:42:36,376 --> 00:42:41,109
Their views were suppressed,
ridiculed and forgotten...

650
00:42:41,881 --> 00:42:44,543
...by the Platonists
and by the Christians...

651
00:42:44,751 --> 00:42:48,243
...who adopted much of
the philosophy of Plato.

652
00:42:49,022 --> 00:42:53,755
Finally, after a long,
mystical sleep...

653
00:42:54,027 --> 00:42:58,623
...in which the tools of
scientific inquiry lay moldering...

654
00:42:58,831 --> 00:43:01,629
...the Ionian approach was
rediscovered.

655
00:43:06,606 --> 00:43:09,302
The Western world reawakened.

656
00:43:09,509 --> 00:43:12,967
Experiment and open inquiry...

657
00:43:13,179 --> 00:43:16,580
...slowly became respectable
once again.

658
00:43:17,283 --> 00:43:21,344
Forgotten books and fragments were
read once more.

659
00:43:21,721 --> 00:43:25,782
Leonardo and Copernicus
and Columbus...

660
00:43:25,992 --> 00:43:29,155
...were inspired by
the Ionian tradition.

661
00:43:41,407 --> 00:43:45,207
The Pythagoreans
and their successors...

662
00:43:45,411 --> 00:43:48,403
...held the peculiar notion that...

663
00:43:48,614 --> 00:43:50,878
...the Earth was tainted...

664
00:43:51,084 --> 00:43:53,518
...somehow nasty...

665
00:43:53,719 --> 00:43:58,349
...while the heavens were
pristine and divine.

666
00:43:59,025 --> 00:44:01,755
So the fundamental idea
that the Earth is a planet...

667
00:44:01,961 --> 00:44:04,691
...that we're citizens
of the universe...

668
00:44:04,897 --> 00:44:07,627
...was rejected and forgotten.

669
00:44:11,037 --> 00:44:14,837
This idea was first argued
by Aristarchus...

670
00:44:15,041 --> 00:44:19,000
...born here on Samos,
three centuries after Pythagoras.

671
00:44:19,212 --> 00:44:22,045
He held that the Earth moves
around the sun.

672
00:44:22,248 --> 00:44:25,479
He correctly located our place
in the solar system.

673
00:44:25,685 --> 00:44:29,553
For his trouble,
he was accused of heresy.

674
00:44:31,324 --> 00:44:35,658
From the size of the Earth's shadow
on the moon during a lunar eclipse...

675
00:44:35,862 --> 00:44:40,060
...he deduced that the sun
had to be much, much larger...

676
00:44:40,266 --> 00:44:43,360
...than the Earth,
and also very far away.

677
00:44:43,769 --> 00:44:46,363
From this he may have argued
that it was absurd...

678
00:44:46,572 --> 00:44:49,598
...for so large an object as the sun
to be going around...

679
00:44:49,809 --> 00:44:52,903
...so small an object as the Earth.

680
00:44:53,112 --> 00:44:57,981
So he put the sun rather than the Earth
at the center of the solar system.

681
00:44:58,184 --> 00:45:01,711
And he had the Earth and the other
planets going around the sun.

682
00:45:01,921 --> 00:45:05,288
He also had the Earth rotating
on its axis once a day.

683
00:45:05,491 --> 00:45:09,655
These are ideas that we ordinarily
associate with the name Copernicus.

684
00:45:09,862 --> 00:45:13,354
But Copernicus seems to have gotten
some hint of these ideas...

685
00:45:13,566 --> 00:45:16,194
...by reading about Aristarchus.

686
00:45:16,669 --> 00:45:19,399
In fact, in the manuscript
of Copernicus' book...

687
00:45:19,605 --> 00:45:23,041
...he referred to Aristarchus,
but in the final version...

688
00:45:23,242 --> 00:45:25,938
...he suppressed the citation.

689
00:45:26,646 --> 00:45:29,513
Resistance to Aristarchus,
a kind of...

690
00:45:30,149 --> 00:45:32,640
...geocentrism in everyday life,
is with us still.

691
00:45:32,852 --> 00:45:35,787
We still talk about a sun rising...

692
00:45:35,988 --> 00:45:38,456
...and the sun setting.

693
00:45:39,158 --> 00:45:41,752
It's 2200 years since Aristarchus...

694
00:45:41,961 --> 00:45:46,830
...and the language still pretends
that the Earth does not turn...

695
00:45:47,667 --> 00:45:51,694
...that the sun is not at the center
of the solar system.

696
00:45:54,807 --> 00:45:58,573
Aristarchus understood the basic
scheme of the solar system...

697
00:45:58,778 --> 00:46:00,541
...but not its scale.

698
00:46:03,149 --> 00:46:06,812
He knew that the planets move
in concentric orbits about the sun...

699
00:46:07,019 --> 00:46:10,250
...and he probably knew their order
out to Saturn.

700
00:46:11,791 --> 00:46:14,021
But he was much too modest
in his estimates...

701
00:46:14,227 --> 00:46:16,718
...of how far apart the planets are.

702
00:46:17,063 --> 00:46:20,430
In order to calculate the true scale
of the solar system...

703
00:46:20,633 --> 00:46:22,260
...you need a telescope.

704
00:46:22,668 --> 00:46:26,160
It wasn't until the 1 7th century
that astronomers were able to get...

705
00:46:26,372 --> 00:46:30,069
...even a rough estimate
of the distance to the sun.

706
00:46:32,078 --> 00:46:34,569
And once you knew
the distance to the sun...

707
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:36,338
...what about the stars?

708
00:46:36,549 --> 00:46:38,983
How far away are they?

709
00:46:42,888 --> 00:46:46,380
There is a way to measure
the distance to the stars...

710
00:46:46,592 --> 00:46:49,322
...and the Ionians were
fully capable of discovering it.

711
00:46:49,528 --> 00:46:53,328
Aristarchus had toyed
with the daring idea...

712
00:46:53,532 --> 00:46:56,262
...that the stars were distant suns.

713
00:46:56,469 --> 00:46:58,937
Now, if a star were as near
as the sun...

714
00:46:59,138 --> 00:47:02,369
...it should appear as big
and as bright as the sun.

715
00:47:02,575 --> 00:47:06,341
Everyone knows that the farther away
an object is, the smaller it seems.

716
00:47:06,545 --> 00:47:10,003
This inverse proportionality between
apparent size and distance...

717
00:47:10,216 --> 00:47:13,913
...is the basis of perspective
in art and photography.

718
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,816
So the further away we are
from the sun...

719
00:47:17,023 --> 00:47:19,924
...the smaller and dimmer it appears.

720
00:47:20,126 --> 00:47:23,323
How far from the sun would we
have to be for it to appear...

721
00:47:23,529 --> 00:47:25,793
...as small and dim as a star?

722
00:47:25,998 --> 00:47:28,967
Or equivalently,
how small a piece of sun...

723
00:47:29,168 --> 00:47:31,398
...would be as bright as a star?

724
00:47:31,771 --> 00:47:36,265
An experiment to answer this question
was performed in 17th-century Holland...

725
00:47:36,475 --> 00:47:41,310
...by Christiaan Huygens and is
very much in the Ionian tradition.

726
00:47:41,514 --> 00:47:46,451
Huygens drilled a number of holes
in a brass plate...

727
00:47:46,886 --> 00:47:49,286
...and held the plate up to the sun.

728
00:47:49,488 --> 00:47:54,289
He asked himself,
which hole seemed as bright...

729
00:47:54,493 --> 00:47:58,759
...as he remembered the star Sirius
to have been the previous evening.

730
00:47:58,964 --> 00:48:01,990
Well, the hole that matched was
effectively...

731
00:48:02,201 --> 00:48:06,934
...1 l28,000th the apparent size
of the sun.

732
00:48:07,206 --> 00:48:11,267
So Sirius, he reasoned,
must be 28,000 times...

733
00:48:11,477 --> 00:48:15,777
...further away than the sun,
or about half a light-year away.

734
00:48:16,382 --> 00:48:19,146
It's hard to remember
just how bright a star is...

735
00:48:19,352 --> 00:48:23,186
...hours after you've looked at it,
but Huygens remembered very well.

736
00:48:23,389 --> 00:48:27,416
If he had known that Sirius was
intrinsically brighter than the sun...

737
00:48:27,626 --> 00:48:30,026
...he would've gotten
the answer exactly right.

738
00:48:30,229 --> 00:48:34,290
Sirius is 8.8 light-years
away from us.

739
00:48:35,267 --> 00:48:38,134
Between Aristarchus and Huygens...

740
00:48:38,337 --> 00:48:41,568
...people had answered that question
which had so excited me...

741
00:48:41,774 --> 00:48:43,639
...as a young boy growing up
in Brooklyn:

742
00:48:43,843 --> 00:48:46,209
The question, "What are the stars?"

743
00:48:49,648 --> 00:48:54,585
And the answer is that the stars are
mighty suns, light-years away...

744
00:48:54,787 --> 00:48:57,187
...in the depths
of interstellar space.

745
00:49:02,995 --> 00:49:07,329
And around those suns,
are there other planets?

746
00:49:08,401 --> 00:49:10,369
And on those other worlds...

747
00:49:10,569 --> 00:49:13,538
...are there beings
who wonder as we do?

748
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:20,310
Here is a light bulb...

749
00:49:20,513 --> 00:49:23,073
...which is supposed to represent
a nearby star.

750
00:49:23,282 --> 00:49:26,740
Next to it, and very hard to see
because of the bright light...

751
00:49:26,952 --> 00:49:28,317
...is a planet.

752
00:49:28,521 --> 00:49:32,048
We'll need a volunteer.
Who would like to come up, please?

753
00:49:32,725 --> 00:49:35,319
Ordinarily, it's hard to
see the planet...

754
00:49:35,528 --> 00:49:39,487
...because it's so close that the star
washes out the planet.

755
00:49:39,698 --> 00:49:44,135
But if we're able to put something
in front of the star...

756
00:49:44,336 --> 00:49:47,863
...to make an artificial eclipse,
then we might be able to see the planet.

757
00:49:48,073 --> 00:49:52,339
I'm gonna stand over here.
Imagine that I'm a telescope...

758
00:49:52,545 --> 00:49:53,978
...somewhere near the Earth.

759
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:58,082
And, Tab, if you'd slowly move
the disc across.

760
00:49:58,284 --> 00:50:00,275
Good. A little faster would be nice.

761
00:50:00,486 --> 00:50:03,114
Now you're just beginning to cover
over the star.

762
00:50:03,322 --> 00:50:06,348
I really can't see the planet at all.
Keep going.

763
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:08,026
Now, right there...

764
00:50:08,227 --> 00:50:10,593
...I can't see the star at all...

765
00:50:10,796 --> 00:50:14,698
...and I see the planet lit
by the light of the star.

766
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:18,233
Now, that is a method for looking
for planets...

767
00:50:18,437 --> 00:50:20,268
...around nearby stars.

768
00:50:20,473 --> 00:50:25,410
And that method uses a spacecraft
to hold the disc...

769
00:50:25,945 --> 00:50:28,413
...and scan the sky
for another telescope...

770
00:50:28,614 --> 00:50:31,344
...to see if there are any planets.

771
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:35,884
Tab, you accomplished your mission
to look for planets around other stars.

772
00:50:36,088 --> 00:50:39,251
Thank you for being
our interplanetary spacecraft.

773
00:50:39,458 --> 00:50:42,052
So this is one way.

774
00:50:42,261 --> 00:50:45,662
And there are spaceships
that will be able to do this...

775
00:50:45,865 --> 00:50:47,628
...in the next 1 0 years or so.

776
00:50:47,833 --> 00:50:49,300
And there's another way.

777
00:50:49,502 --> 00:50:52,027
This has already been tried
from the Earth.

778
00:50:52,238 --> 00:50:56,334
Imagine that there's a nearby star
that you can see.

779
00:50:56,542 --> 00:51:00,535
It's bright and it has
a dark companion, a planet...

780
00:51:00,746 --> 00:51:04,147
...shining only by reflected light
near it, so dim you can't see it.

781
00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:09,117
But imagine that this planet
and its star...

782
00:51:09,321 --> 00:51:11,186
...are going around each other.

783
00:51:12,324 --> 00:51:13,655
Like that:

784
00:51:13,859 --> 00:51:16,453
You can see the star,
you can't see the planet.

785
00:51:16,662 --> 00:51:19,028
So now I'm gonna need two volunteers.

786
00:51:21,233 --> 00:51:22,257
You two.

787
00:51:23,602 --> 00:51:26,469
Just to save time
because they're in the front row.

788
00:51:26,672 --> 00:51:29,698
I need one of you to turn
the star and the planet...

789
00:51:29,909 --> 00:51:33,868
...and another person to pull
the star and planet along.

790
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:35,546
And what you will see...

791
00:51:35,748 --> 00:51:39,081
...is that the star
you can make out...

792
00:51:39,285 --> 00:51:41,913
...will be moving
in a funny, wiggly pattern...

793
00:51:42,121 --> 00:51:44,248
...which will be the clue,
the evidence...

794
00:51:44,456 --> 00:51:46,720
...for the existence
of the dark planet.

795
00:51:46,926 --> 00:51:50,123
Okay, let's have a spin. Good.
And a pull.

796
00:51:50,329 --> 00:51:51,990
And you see this funny motion...

797
00:51:52,197 --> 00:51:56,861
...that the star makes
because of the planet. Thank you.

798
00:51:57,069 --> 00:52:00,266
That's another way of finding out
the existence of a planet...

799
00:52:00,472 --> 00:52:03,373
...that you couldn't see directly.

800
00:52:03,576 --> 00:52:06,704
Well, both of these methods are
being used.

801
00:52:07,012 --> 00:52:11,676
And by the time that you people are...

802
00:52:11,884 --> 00:52:13,681
...as old as I am...

803
00:52:13,886 --> 00:52:17,253
...we should know,
for all the nearest stars...

804
00:52:17,456 --> 00:52:19,890
...if they have planets
going around them.

805
00:52:20,092 --> 00:52:24,461
We might know dozens or even hundreds
of other planetary systems...

806
00:52:24,663 --> 00:52:27,962
...and see if they're like our own
or very different...

807
00:52:28,167 --> 00:52:31,762
...or no other planets
going around other stars at all.

808
00:52:31,971 --> 00:52:34,235
That will happen in your lifetime.

809
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:39,104
It'll be the first time in the world's
history that anybody found out...

810
00:52:39,845 --> 00:52:42,575
...if there are planets
around the other stars.

811
00:52:42,781 --> 00:52:47,718
Now, the nearby stars, the ones
you can see with the naked eye...

812
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:50,284
...those are all
in the solar neighborhood.

813
00:52:50,489 --> 00:52:52,980
That's what astronomers call it:
The neighborhood.

814
00:52:53,192 --> 00:52:57,788
But it's a very tiny place
in the Milky Way galaxy.

815
00:52:58,731 --> 00:53:00,858
The Milky Way is that band of light...

816
00:53:01,066 --> 00:53:04,160
...that you see across the sky
on a clear night.

817
00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:07,498
I can't tell if there are any more
clear nights in Brooklyn.

818
00:53:07,706 --> 00:53:11,369
You must've seen the Milky Way,
a faint band of light at night.

819
00:53:11,577 --> 00:53:16,207
Well, that's just 100 billion stars...

820
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:18,349
...all seen together...

821
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:21,144
...edge on, as in this picture.

822
00:53:21,353 --> 00:53:24,686
If you could get out of
the Milky Way and look down on it...

823
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:26,790
...it would look like that picture.

824
00:53:26,992 --> 00:53:29,153
If we did look down
on the Milky Way...

825
00:53:29,361 --> 00:53:32,057
...where would the sun
and nearby stars be?

826
00:53:32,264 --> 00:53:35,427
Would it be in the center where things
look important...

827
00:53:35,634 --> 00:53:37,101
...or at least well-lit?

828
00:53:37,836 --> 00:53:41,169
No. We would be way out here...

829
00:53:41,373 --> 00:53:45,366
...in the suburbs,
in the countryside of the galaxy.

830
00:53:45,577 --> 00:53:47,238
We're not in any important place.

831
00:53:47,446 --> 00:53:51,212
All the stars you could see would be
in a little place like that.

832
00:53:51,417 --> 00:53:54,614
And the Milky Way would be
this band of light...

833
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:57,380
...100 billion stars all together.

834
00:53:57,856 --> 00:54:00,791
The fact that we live
in the outskirts of the galaxy...

835
00:54:00,993 --> 00:54:04,485
...was discovered a long time ago...

836
00:54:04,697 --> 00:54:07,257
...towards the end
of the First World War...

837
00:54:07,466 --> 00:54:09,764
...by a man named Harlow Shapley...

838
00:54:09,968 --> 00:54:14,200
...who was mapping the position
of these clusters of stars.

839
00:54:14,406 --> 00:54:16,897
See, every one of these is a bunch...

840
00:54:17,109 --> 00:54:19,577
...of maybe 1 0,000 stars all together.

841
00:54:19,778 --> 00:54:21,769
It's called a globular cluster.

842
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:25,279
And you can see that they are
centered around the middle...

843
00:54:25,484 --> 00:54:27,315
...the center of the galaxy.

844
00:54:27,586 --> 00:54:31,352
People used to think that the sun was
at the center of the galaxy...

845
00:54:31,557 --> 00:54:35,789
...something important about our
position. That turns out to be wrong.

846
00:54:36,128 --> 00:54:38,358
We live in the outskirts...

847
00:54:38,564 --> 00:54:40,998
...the globular clusters are
centered around...

848
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:45,163
...the marvelous middle
of the Milky Way galaxy.

849
00:54:45,370 --> 00:54:49,204
And then it turned out
that this isn't the only galaxy.

850
00:54:49,408 --> 00:54:51,842
We live in this one...

851
00:54:52,444 --> 00:54:54,207
...but there are many others.

852
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:57,572
And as this picture reminds us...

853
00:54:58,283 --> 00:55:00,717
...there are many different kinds
of galaxies...

854
00:55:00,919 --> 00:55:03,319
...of which ours might be
just this one.

855
00:55:03,522 --> 00:55:08,084
There are, in fact,
100 billion other galaxies...

856
00:55:08,293 --> 00:55:13,230
...each of which contains
something like 100 billion stars.

857
00:55:13,966 --> 00:55:18,903
Think of how many stars and planets
and kinds of life there may be...

858
00:55:19,705 --> 00:55:23,869
...in this vast and awesome universe.

859
00:55:26,678 --> 00:55:28,839
As long as there have been humans...

860
00:55:29,047 --> 00:55:32,448
...we have searched
for our place in the cosmos.

861
00:55:32,651 --> 00:55:35,449
Where are we? Who are we?

862
00:55:37,556 --> 00:55:41,856
We find that we live
on an insignificant planet...

863
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:44,028
...of a humdrum star...

864
00:55:44,229 --> 00:55:47,392
...lost in a galaxy
tucked away in some...

865
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:50,796
...forgotten corner of a universe
in which there are...

866
00:55:51,003 --> 00:55:54,268
...far more galaxies than people.

867
00:55:57,509 --> 00:56:01,275
We make our world significant by
the courage of our questions...

868
00:56:01,713 --> 00:56:04,341
...and by the depth of our answers.

869
00:56:05,918 --> 00:56:09,012
We embarked on our journey
to the stars...

870
00:56:09,621 --> 00:56:12,215
...with a question first framed...

871
00:56:12,424 --> 00:56:14,949
...in the childhood of our species...

872
00:56:15,394 --> 00:56:19,660
...and in each generation
asked anew...

873
00:56:19,932 --> 00:56:22,093
...with undiminished wonder:

874
00:56:22,467 --> 00:56:24,628
"What are the stars?"

875
00:56:42,721 --> 00:56:45,588
Exploration is in our nature.

876
00:56:46,191 --> 00:56:48,489
We began as wanderers...

877
00:56:48,794 --> 00:56:51,661
...and we are wanderers still.

878
00:57:02,941 --> 00:57:05,637
We have lingered long enough...

879
00:57:05,844 --> 00:57:08,642
...on the shores of the cosmic ocean.

880
00:57:08,881 --> 00:57:10,678
We are ready at last...

881
00:57:10,883 --> 00:57:14,114
...to set sail for the stars.
