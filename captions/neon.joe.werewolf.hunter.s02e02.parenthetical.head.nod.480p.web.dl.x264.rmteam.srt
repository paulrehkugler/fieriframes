He's my Elon Musk-type
associate.

00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,060
Moon is alive.

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,990
Yeah, we hear you.
Moon is alive.

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,660
You stole my ex-wife
and left her for dead!

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,160
Joe, don't leave me!

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,030
Joe, you're under arrest
for the murder of Plaid Jeff.

8
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,800
Joe.

9
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,140
I got a bad feeling about this.

10
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,580
Don't you worry about nothin',
Cleve, all right?

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,150
Joe all cool as a cucumber.

12
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,920
Matter of fact,

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,020
this the only evidence
I need to win the case.

14
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,850
All rise for

15
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,820

So, has the jury
reached a verdict?

17
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,170
We have, Your Honor.

18
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,170
We find Neon Joe...

00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,120
as Plaid Jeff's murderer,
Neon Joe,

40
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,090
was sentenced to life in prison.

Hey.

So, uh, welcome.

That's a cool eye patch.

47
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,290
What happened?

48
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,960
What are you lookin' for?
A tunnel.

49
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,960
Or the beginnin' of a tunnel

50
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,170
so I can escape, clear my name.

51
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,700
There are no tunnels in here.

52
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,400
But, uh, I could show you
around the prison.

53
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,570
Maybe we find one.

54
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,970
There's no tunnels in there.

55
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,080
This is our wheelchair factory,
very popular.

56
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,510
Hey, Bobby.

57
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,880
Hey, I got a new cell mate.

58
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,580
Yeah, so, no tunnels in there,
either...

59
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,050
uh, definitely.

60
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,080
Hey, Gar, who's it goin'?
I got a new cell mate.

61
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,320
Oh! Country-music star,
Joshy Cashington,

62
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,890
is gonna be playin' one song
here tonight.

63
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,160
Well, I've always wanted
to see the man

64
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,260
who prefers to be
exclusively clad

65
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,100
in midnight blue.

66
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,000
Oh, and tomorrow night
is the big costume ball

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,170
at the lady prison
down the river.

68
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:43,270
Hey, uh, why does it say
"head nod" in parenthetical?

69
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,610
Oh, yeah.

70
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,510
The sign was confusing.

71
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,910
Yeah, we thought there was something
wrong with the guy's neck,

72
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,580
so they put "head nod"
in parentheses

73
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,950
to clarify that he wasn't hurt.

74
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,120
He's just noddin' his head

75
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,120
toward the lady prison
down the river.

76
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,360
The Mexicans
wanted to go in black face,

77
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,890
and the blacks
wanted to go in Mexican face,

78
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,230
till everyone realized
it was Big Lair's plan

79
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,630
to start a race war.

80
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,130

Big Larry might be the devil,

93
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,270
but he got
the voice of an angel.

94
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,140
You got to call him
"Big Lair."

95
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,310
Last guy to call him Big Larry
was never heard from again.

96

Are you eyeballin' me, new meat?

No.

98
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:03,520
Just wonderin' why
an Aryan named "Larry"

99
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,860
would call himself "Big Lair"
and not "Big Larryan."

100
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,930
Missed opportunity
for a super-cool pun.

101
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,030
I could kill you right now.

102
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,500
Don't do it, Big Lair.

103
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,870
You kill him, then no dance

104
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,800
at the ladies prison
down the river,

105
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,840
and you don't get your jollies.

106
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,840
Think about your jollies,
Big Lair.

107
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,680
Yeah.

Oh, hey, do know

Weird.

Yuri's so funny.

122
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,820
He was over there the other day,

00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,660
and he had a napkin on his head.

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,940
I'd love to, Neon Joe,

329
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,380
but I don't want
to get into any trouble.

330
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,540
You the only guard on duty!

331
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,080
Ain't nobody gonna know!

332
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,750
And I bet you didn't
think about none of that

333
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,150
long tush you gonna get

334
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:24,120
when you slappin'
this long bass.

335
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,450
Am I right?

336
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,950
You know what?

337
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,120
I hadn't.

338
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,660
Oh-ho, yeah!

339
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,790
Well, then, why don't you, uh,
get on down here?

340
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:34,290
Let's play some bass, man!

341
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,760
Can't wait to taste
some of that long tush.

342
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,030
I'll tell you that.

343
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,910
All right, so,
which way that sewer?

344
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,510
This way or this way?

345
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,310
It's this way.
Let's do it.

346
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:01,160
I knew you were faking.

347
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,260
What are you, some kind of
Hebrew for Hitler now?

348
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,490
I'm an Ashke-Nazi.

349
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,130
Pretty good pun.

350
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:12,130
Don't make up for droppin'
the ball on Big Larryan,

351
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,400
but, uh, yeah,
that was pretty good.

352
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,110
The more I studied the Torah,

353
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:25,050
the more I knew that the Jews
are the chosen people,

354
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:29,150
and it's the non-Jews
who should all die.

355
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:32,220
And now I'm gonna send you
to Hell!

356
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,960
But the Jews don't believe
in the afterlife.

357
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,530
Talmudic Rabbis have long argued

358
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:41,160
about what happens to us,

359
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,460
but they all agree

360
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,300
that it's what we do here
that's most important!

361
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,900
Yeah?

362
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,540
Well, how did the Torah feel
about a Jew killin' a Jew?

363
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,210
It's against it!

364
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,880
Then, you better
drop that kippah,

365
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,180
'cause I too
have converted to Judaism.

366
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,050
You're a liar.

367
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,750
Allow me to show you

368
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:13,230
<i>my</i> covenant with God.

369
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:16,230
Wow.

370
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:19,600
I've never seen
a more perfect cut.

371
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,670
Choke on it.

372
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,780
Ohh, I'chaim!

373
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,620
Oh, he-yump.

374
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,620
He-yump. He-yump.

375
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:44,730
When did you have time to convert?
I didn't.

376
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:47,390
A werewolf did that.

377
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,900
Now let's get
the he-yump outta here.

378
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:54,970
It's a long-bass injury!

379
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,270
We got a prison break!

380
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,770
Seems like you makin' me
go this way on purpose.

381
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,380
I did.

382
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,110
It's right up here.

383
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,540
Is it close?

384
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,810
About 500 yards.

385
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:06,780
I'm gonna he-yump.

386
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,320
Just follow the stink.

387
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,730
He-yow!

388
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:24,000
Joshy.

389
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,800
"Taking a sick day.

390
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:33,840
Be back soon. Yuri."

391
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,940
Looks like I'm workin'
twice as hard today.

392
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:40,480
Hey.

393
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,050
Where did the ducks go?

394
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:46,290
I've never seen Big Lair
look so peaceful.

395
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:49,160
Must have found solace
right before he died.

396
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,460
Mm.

397
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,160
I'll oy what he's veying.

398
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,230
