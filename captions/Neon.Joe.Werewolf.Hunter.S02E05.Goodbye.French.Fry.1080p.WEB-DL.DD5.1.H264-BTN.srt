2
00:00:04,305 --> 00:00:05,604
Make love to me, Joe.

3
00:00:05,606 --> 00:00:08,040
Oh, he-yump!
Oh, he-yump! Oh, oh!

4
00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:09,842
You sound like a man
whose heart's been broken.

5
00:00:09,844 --> 00:00:11,143
You leave Barbara out of this!

6
00:00:11,145 --> 00:00:13,445
You stole my ex-wife
and left her for dead!

7
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:14,847
Joe, don't leave me!

8
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,615
The military felt
that it would be better

9
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:18,050
to rebuild me than repair me,

10
00:00:18,052 --> 00:00:20,319
so I told them
to make me into a man.

11
00:00:20,321 --> 00:00:22,454
When the hearts of
40 werewolves come together,

12
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:24,056
they form
an all-powerful cube,

13
00:00:24,058 --> 00:00:25,557
summoning the moon
towards Earth.

14
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:28,560
You must castrate the cube
in order to kill it.

15
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:30,229
Your old rings.
Put them on.

16
00:00:30,231 --> 00:00:31,697
When you two were in love

17
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,465
and at the peak of your werewolf
hunting abilities,

18
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:35,200
you were unstoppable.

19
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,336
What about me?

20
00:00:37,338 --> 00:00:39,705
Just walk away, friend.
Just walk away.

21
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:41,807
You're working
with the werewolves?

22
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:45,477
There will be a race
of super-powerful werewolves.

23
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,579
I'd be fool not
to work with them.

24
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:49,815
I'll be running the show
from now on.

25
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:01,693
I ain't been on a road trip
in a long time.

26
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:02,928
Cars are cool now...

27
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,031
GPS, seats that heat your butt,

28
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:09,168
movies in the headrest
for the kids.

29
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:12,704
Hey, we should have kids.

30
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:14,873
You know, while you
still can physically,

31
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:17,176
and while I still
shootin' silver bullets.

32
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:18,844
I mean, who knows
how they turn out, right?

33
00:01:18,846 --> 00:01:20,212
Maybe they grow up to be cool.

34
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:21,780
Maybe grow up
to be little A-holes.

35
00:01:21,782 --> 00:01:24,583
But that's what
having kids all about.

36
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:27,519
Stick it in, roll the dice.

37
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:29,455
I've hacked into
the military server.

38
00:01:29,457 --> 00:01:33,559
I'm just trying to get
to Daggart's personal files.

39
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:35,194
<i>Welcome back, Colonel Daggart.</i>

40
00:01:35,196 --> 00:01:36,462
Bingo, I'm in.

41
00:01:36,464 --> 00:01:38,530
How we gonna get to you,
asshole?

42
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:41,266
Huh. Interesting.

43
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:44,536
It says he likes
to carbo-load before battles.

44
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:46,238
Oh!

45
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,372
What the hell, Joe?!

46
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:50,876
♪♪

47
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,947
Daggart!

48
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:57,583
You hit the carb on the load.

49
00:01:57,585 --> 00:02:00,285
♪♪

50
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,803
Here you go, hon.
Mmm!

51
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:20,839
Soup in a bread bowl
and another milkshake.

52
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:22,608
Thanks, Jen.
Everything is delicious.

53
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,910
Oh, good.
Mmm.

54
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:27,079
That look good.

55
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:30,249
Yeah, I do love me
a good soup in a bread bowl.

56
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:32,985
What you got there,
a buckwheat rye or sourdough?

57
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:35,587
Hmm.
I'll take that.

58
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:37,156
Nice try.

59
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,491
Oh.

60
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,360
Cool space gun.

61
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,263
Don't you be doing nothing dumb

62
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:46,765
like trying to transform
into a werewolf

63
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,700
or nothing like that
up in he-yump.

64
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:49,768
Here you go, sweetie.

65
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,603
Thanks, Jen.
Mm-hmm.

66
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:52,871
Anything for you, folks?

67
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:54,273
No, thank you.

68
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:57,509
I'll actually have a shrimp po' boy.
Mm-hmm.

69
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:00,179
If you got tartar sauce,
put that on the side, please.

70
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:02,881
I'll take a lettuce,
tomato, and onion. Mm-hmm.

71
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:04,616
Sweet potato tater tots
would be good.

72
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:07,619
Just well done, a little
extra crispy on the outside...

73
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:10,155
You know, when you crack it open
in half and it get all steamy

74
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:12,057
but the inside is soft.
Mm-hmm.

75
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:14,793
Watermelon basil lemonade
and a little bit of ice.

76
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:16,328
But don't overdo it
with the ice.

77
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,030
Come on. Give me...
Give me the juice.

78
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:19,998
Got you.
Coming right up, darling.

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,036
Fries for the table.
Help yourselves.

80
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:25,804
Congrats on escaping the cave.

81
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:28,407
Of course we escaped the cave.
We in love.

82
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:30,375
Pfft. Love.

83
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:33,345
I've done 40 years military-grade
couples counseling.

84
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:36,315
Dirty little secret I learned...
Love is a hoax.

85
00:03:36,317 --> 00:03:37,983
Relationships are just a way

86
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:40,085
for one person
to control another.

87
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:42,821
Like the way Barbara did.

88
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:44,022
Who's this Barbara?

89
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:45,757
You leave Barbara out of this!

90
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,993
What's your end game, Daggart?

91
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:50,262
What kind of dingo
are you dangling?

92
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:51,697
Give up on love.

93
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:54,032
Let's destroy the cube
and rule the world together

94
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:55,667
as bachelors and bachelorette.

95
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:58,537
Nations would cower at our army
of super werewolves

96
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:02,341
and be in awe of our
self-reliant singles mind-set.

97
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:05,344
Break up and join me.

98
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:06,845
Jose.

99
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:08,180
What?

100
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:11,984
That's short for,
"No way, amigo."

101
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:15,454
What are you scared of?
Think about it.

102
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:17,723
The three of us
could rule as one!

103
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:24,263
Break up with her.

104
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:25,464
Do it now!

105
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:27,232
Dump her and join me.

106
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:29,201
Jose.

107
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:32,204
Tell him you need your space
and gain the world.

108
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:33,805
Jose.

109
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:35,240
Pathetic.

110
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:37,042
You just threw away
your last chance at happiness.

111
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:38,377
Don't say I didn't warn you

112
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:40,045
when you drive yourselves insane

113
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:42,481
arguing about how someone loaded
the dishwasher!

114
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,656
Hi, Joe.

115
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:52,824
Hey, babe.

116
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:55,594
Just walk away, you said.

117
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:57,729
Just walk away, he said.

118
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,798
Well, I didn't walk away!

119
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,367
Plaid Jeff never walks
away from a fight!

120
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,071
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

121
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,508
I'm here for this.

122
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,517
Keys, please.

123
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:23,955
Don't be a hero.

124
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:27,292
Can't not be what I is.

125
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:28,593
That be like me telling you

126
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,929
don't keep coming
in second place in life

127
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:31,997
all the time.

128
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,031
All right.

129
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,599
Give me the damn keys.

130
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,868
Be cool, Joe Cocker.

131
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,146
Did you have to go
and rub it in?

132
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:51,650
Oh, come on. That's he
and I's combative dynamic.

133
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:54,319
It's just guys being guys.

134
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:55,487
Sick of it.

135
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:58,357
Let's get Daggart's keys
and get out of here.

136
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:01,126
Yeah, don't worry, babe,
'cause, uh...

137
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:04,629
we ketchup.

138
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:08,467
Oh, man!

139
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:10,635
Some of his blood
must have got in there!

140
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:12,471
Ruin my cool pun.

141
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:14,306
Over there! Over there!

142
00:06:14,308 --> 00:06:15,874
Come on, come on, come on!

143
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,576
Faster, faster!
Move, move!

144
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:20,379
Flowers there
and more champagne.

145
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,449
The moon is coming!

146
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,687
Final spritz!

147
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:37,329
I'm lubed up and ready, moon!

148
00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:39,164
Ha ha!

149
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:45,504
Well, here it is, babe...
Home, sweet he-yump.

150
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:48,540
Not bad, right?

151
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:51,743
I see somebody's been keeping
you company while I was gone.

152
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,245
Oh, yeah.

153
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:55,514
Yeah, I got the paper cuts
on my dick to prove it.

154
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:57,215
Took a while for them to scab up

155
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:59,217
on account of they don't really
make Band-Aid

156
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:01,253
for the penile region
of doing them,

157
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:02,587
you know,
the knuckle Band-Aid.

158
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,222
That work good,
but then I gotta, like,

159
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:06,191
pull it down to pee,
pull it back up.

160
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:07,893
I went through
a whole lot of Band-Aid.

161
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:09,761
Joe, what are we doing here?

162
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,363
Come on, now.

163
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:13,064
Don't tell me that you, uh...

164
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,200
forgot
our pre-hunt ritual.

165
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,870
No.

166
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:20,539
We are not having sex.

167
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,541
There's no time.

168
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:24,242
Come on, babe.

169
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:27,045
You know there's no better way
to consummate things

170
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:28,647
than by launching
ourselves into battle

171
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:33,051
with a simultaneous
orgas-he-yump.

172
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:36,455
Don't you remember
what it was like?

173
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:39,958
Being all filled up
with a lot of Joe.

174
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,927
Deep inside.

175
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:47,432
Hot... throbbing... stiff.

176
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:50,302
I mean, yeah, we'll be tired,

177
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,971
but we'll be satisfied...

178
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:56,041
and unstoppable.

179
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:06,685
Okay.

180
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:08,487
Oh, he-yump.

181
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:09,454
Yeah.

182
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:12,424
You gonna like this bed.

183
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:14,426
Yeah, I mean, it not
the greatest mattress,

184
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:17,929
but, you know, since we gonna
be quick, it's gonna be fine.

185
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:19,097
It'll do the job.

186
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:20,932
What the he-yump?!

187
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:23,168
Jeff!
What are you doing here?!

188
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,770
I just couldn't shake
you guys' relationship.

189
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:28,373
All I wanted to do
when I saw you at the bar

190
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,141
was get a rise out of you.

191
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:33,111
Yeah, well, Joe's about
as cool a cuc as they come.

192
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:35,280
So how about you
give me that sword,

193
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:37,148
let this cumber do the job?

194
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,783
Let me just throw
something out there

195
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:40,452
that I've been thinking on.

196
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:43,688
If you two are such a powerful
werewolf-hunting couple,

197
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,892
imagine how much
more powerful we'd be...

198
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:48,126
as a threesome.

199
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:51,129
I know I'll never get you back,

200
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:53,031
but if we teamed up,

201
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:56,401
the lust,
the passion, the jealousy...

202
00:08:56,403 --> 00:09:00,005
Think of all the killings
we could accomplish.

203
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:03,341
And the orgasms.

204
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:05,176
Normally, I would not
even consider this

205
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:07,145
for a second, but, uh...

206
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:10,181
given the dire state
of the world as it is,

207
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:13,718
I find myself
with a semi-chub.

208
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,555
Babe?

209
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:17,756
I'm game if you are.

210
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:20,025
I'm about to explode
just thinking about it!

211
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:21,326
All right.
Let's go!

212
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:22,761
"Three way" on three.

213
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:24,362
One, two, three.

214
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:25,864
Three way!
Three way! Three way!

215
00:09:57,296 --> 00:10:00,265
Ready or not,
here I he-yump.

216
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:06,905
Now there is the Joe I remember.

217
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:08,273
Looking good, partner.

218
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,041
Appreciate that, Plaid Jeff.

219
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:11,810
And, hey, uh...

220
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:12,944
congrats.

221
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,245
For what?

222
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:16,948
You finally got
a rise out of me.

223
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:23,188
Before we go,
just one more thing.

224
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:26,658
Let's make it official.

225
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,194
I got this made just in case
you guys said yes.

226
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,633
All right. Now let's
go chop this cube's nuts!

227
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:38,269
Wait.
Where's the sword?

228
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:39,838
I set it next to that couch.

229
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,574
All right, now h-h-hold up.
Let's just retrace our step.

230
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:45,577
Hold up before we panic.
Um, now let's see.

231
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:47,646
W-W-We decided on the three way.
Yeah. Yeah.

232
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:49,447
Got undressed.
Yeah. Yeah.

233
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:51,082
Got in bed.
Yeah. Yeah.

234
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:52,784
Lubed up.
Yeah. Yeah.

235
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:54,919
Plaid Jeff, I started sucking your toes.
Yeah. Yeah.

236
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:57,856
Babe, you was massaging my
devil's onion ring. Yeah. Yeah.

237
00:10:57,858 --> 00:11:00,592
I stuck my onion ring in
your barbecue sauce. Yeah.

238
00:11:00,594 --> 00:11:02,127
Then Yuri did
a reach-around.

239
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:03,495
Yu... Yu...

240
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,197
Yuri!

241
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:26,551
Well, well, well.

242
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:29,888
Look who finally
showed up for the fight.

243
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,624
You enjoy
Yuri's reach-around?

244
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:36,327
I don't know who I grabbed,
but it was small.

245
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:39,698
So must have been Joe!

246
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,699
Yeah, funny.

247
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,367
That was
a quality reach-around,

248
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:43,535
I'll give you that.

249
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:45,203
You a sneaky little Russki,

250
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,672
getting that werewolf heart
and that sword.

251
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:51,576
But tonight,
all good things must come...

252
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:53,044
to an end.

253
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:56,047
You cannot stop inevitable.

254
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,849
I will finally get the love

255
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:00,351
I have not felt

256
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:02,554
since I first
laid foot on Earth.

257
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:05,056
Yeah, you just one man, Yuri.

258
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,524
We a team now.

259
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:09,394
We go together like peanut,
butter, and he-yump.

260
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,863
I'm glad you guys work it out.

261
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:14,899
But why is it<i> you</i>
who gets to decide

262
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,334
whose love is denied?

263
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:19,237
'Cause we just killed America's
top couples counselor.

264
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,905
And we're taking over the title.

265
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,173
Even as a team,

266
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:25,376
you cannot take on
super werewolves.

267
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:31,916
Oh, shit!

268
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,284
Who let the wolves out?

269
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:35,286
I did.
I know you did.

270
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:37,355
That... That was
just rhetorical.

271
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:39,557
Talk about that song
"Who Let the Dogs Out?"

272
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:42,594
It even catchy
when you say "wolves."

273
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:43,695
Stay close.

274
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:45,730
Let's do our signature move.

275
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:47,031
Go!

276
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,613
Huh?

277
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:02,781
Aah!

278
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,552
Whew.

279
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:11,422
Oh.
Yeah, this thing cool.

280
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:13,258
You was right, Plaid Jeff.

281
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,727
As a threesome,
we twice as nice.

282
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:18,730
Aah! Please don't castrate
the cube!

283
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:22,100
I been waiting for so long!

284
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:23,468
I'll take care of this guy.

285
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,469
You got it, partner.

286
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:25,970
Let's go, babe!

287
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,314
Hey, uh...
Hey, babe?

288
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,348
Babe, real quick.

289
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,184
Uh, this a cool sword, right?

290
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:40,251
Yeah, cool sword.

291
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:41,486
And you and I, uh...

292
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,354
we make a good werewolf
hunting team, right?

293
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:45,023
Yeah,
wh-where's this going?

294
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:48,159
That thing that... that Yuri
said about my he-yump, you know,

295
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,494
being like
a little tiny he-yump,

296
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:50,829
I mean, that ain't true, right?

297
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:53,498
I'm at least average.
At least if not more.

298
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,420
Could we just go castrate
some moon nuts, please?

299
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:57,669
Aah!
Oh!

300
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,304
It's Daggart!

301
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,274
Joe,
don't leave me! Oh!

302
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:05,476
Just go!
I won't leave you!

303
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:07,045
I can't leave you again!

304
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:08,513
Oh, God, please!

305
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:09,714
Okay!

306
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,483
We had a deal.

307
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:13,852
I didn't think
you'd stick to it!

308
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:17,388
Aah! I'm just... I'm
just confused here,

309
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,357
'cause this is what
happened last time, right?

310
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,860
We had the deal,
then the years later,

311
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:23,795
you come back as this dude guy,
and you're like,

312
00:14:23,797 --> 00:14:25,396
"Oh, but that's not
what I mean."

313
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:27,332
Joe, don't worry about
the agreement! Just go!

314
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:29,400
Okay.

315
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:31,069
You left me to die.

316
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:33,304
Triple-checking.

317
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:34,906
Aah!

318
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:36,641
All right!

319
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:39,377
Aah!

320
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:54,058
He-yump!

321
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,228
♪♪

322
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:11,209
I'll have one scoop of moon...

323
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:17,448
hold... the... nuts!

324
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:44,042
We have some breaking tip for
all you "Buzz" -heads tonight.

325
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:46,411
NASA has just confirmed
that the moon

326
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:48,112
is rotating back
to its normal position

327
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,381
and will be moving away
from the Earth.

328
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:51,983
We're all gonna live!

329
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:28,319
Oh, babe.

330
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,821
You know that I would have used

331
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:32,523
all the dick Band-Aids
in the world

332
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:34,926
if I thought
I could have saved you.

333
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:42,633
Oh, he-yump.

334
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:48,206
Oh, he-yump...

335
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,841
Ah, heeda, hida, hoda,

336
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:52,176
hada, heeda,
hada, he-yump!

337
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:58,282
We closed.

338
00:16:58,284 --> 00:17:00,518
Closed?

339
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,155
I traveled all this way
just for a sip.

340
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:06,624
What, you come to get
a final rise out of me?

341
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:08,993
Just came to say goodbye.

342
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:10,661
What ever happened to Yuri?

343
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:13,731
Last I remember, you two was off
to the side of the road,

344
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,466
dancing in the moonlight.

345
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:17,468
Ah, right.

346
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,770
Welp...

347
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,374
I stuck the tip...

348
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:26,144
of my long, black member...

349
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:28,646
right in his mouth...

350
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:30,581
and blew my load
all over the back

351
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,417
of the inside of his skull.

352
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:35,253
You take care, Plaid Jeff.

353
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:36,921
You too, Neon Joe.

354
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:39,791
♪♪

355
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,730
Should there be some kind
of acknowledgment

356
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,965
of losing the woman
we both loved?

357
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:57,041
Seem to me there just was.

358
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:58,276
Goodbye, French fry.

359
00:17:58,278 --> 00:17:59,844
What?

360
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:01,412
I don't know.

361
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,214
First thing I thought of.
Seemed cool.

362
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:06,050
You know, 'cause it rhyme...
Bye, fry.

363
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:09,287
Anyway, you go on, get...
'fore we got to hug.

364
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:10,888
Yeah.

365
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:11,989
Yeah.

366
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:22,266
He-yump?

367
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,104
You in he-yump?

368
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:30,041
Cleve?

369
00:18:30,043 --> 00:18:33,611
Joe! Joe!

370
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:34,612
Oh!

371
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,481
Neon Joe!

372
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:38,483
We've been trapped
in here for hours.

373
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:40,251
We saw a big flash!
What happened?!

374
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:44,088
That's when came upon
Yuri and all of his, uh...

375
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,456
surfer werewolves.

376
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,757
We took them out no problem.

377
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,726
We got this real cool
spin move that we did.

378
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:51,062
Came across a big field,
see the cube.

379
00:18:51,064 --> 00:18:53,397
Got that big old fancy
he-yump sword.

380
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:55,633
Did a big old chop.

381
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,636
Chopped off that cube's sac.

382
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,705
That's about
all she he-yump.

383
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,741
And, uh...

384
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:05,910
what about Vance?

385
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,181
Well...

386
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:15,086
I think it's about time
that this pork loin

387
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:18,689
went back to the barbecue.

388
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:21,893
Find another fox
to keep me company.

389
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:27,231
You know, this here
the coolest bar in town.

390
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,668
I'm the reason for that.
We all know it.

391
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,303
Yeah, you are.

392
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:34,172
But it time to move on.

393
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,176
Cleve...

394
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:40,178
I'm giving you
and Ashley the bar.

395
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,712
The...

396
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,347
The tiny towel?

397
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,216
Yep.
This here been, uh...

398
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:48,186
one heck of
a roller-coaster ride.

399
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,154
First it was up...

400
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:51,789
then it came down.

401
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,691
Then it bank hard to the left.

402
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,660
Then it bank hard to the right.

403
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:57,828
Then it go
a loop-de-loop.

404
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,863
It go up and down.

405
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:00,164
The centrifugal he-yump,

406
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,200
doing all sorts of stuff
with your mind!

407
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:04,735
But then I'm going upside down
for a little bit, right?

408
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:05,903
And you think,
"How am I not falling out

409
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:07,238
of this
contraption he-yump?"

410
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,340
Then you go up again
and go through the water.

411
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:10,741
You get all wet.

412
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:13,744
And when you gonna get
all pissed off about being wet

413
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:15,713
and then resolving it
with yourself where it's like,

414
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:18,716
"It ain't no big deal,"
you going up again.

415
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,018
And you go climbing high,
and you come on down

416
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:24,989
and sneak right back in.

417
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:27,892
Right back to where
it all started from.

418
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:30,728
You get out
and kind of do a he-yump.

419
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:34,599
You jump out, and the people
waiting in line...

420
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:37,535
well, they get their turn.

421
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:39,737
That sounds like a crazy ride.

422
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:42,240
Sure is, Cleve.

423
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:45,610
Hope you enjoy it
as much as I did.

424
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:47,245
You take care of this place.

425
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:48,246
I will.

426
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:50,915
Ashley.

427
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,450
You take care of this guy.

428
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:53,517
He good meat.

429
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:54,752
I will, Joe.

430
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,854
Good luck to you, too,
off-camera Chris.

431
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:58,189
Thanks!
You too!

432
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:01,259
Well...

433
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:03,261
arrivederci, he-yump.

434
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:16,974
With the cube
completely neutered

435
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:19,977
and the moon's backside
back where it belong,

436
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:23,114
is that the end of werewolf
as we know it?

437
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:25,650
Or do Joe got one more adventure
in him?

438
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:29,120
Maybe something involving
snowmobiles or outer space.

439
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:32,123
That sound cool.
Stay tuned, friends.

440
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:36,327
And in the meantime,
good night and good he-yump.
