restaurants all over the world cook

116
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:02,510
culinary products and my favorite thing

117
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:05,959
you have many fans who love to dress up

118
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:08,390

119
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:11,270
few out there today but even with all

120
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:14,360
that success he is still one of the

121
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:16,910
nicest and most generous people I have

122
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,339
ever known he always takes time to sign

123
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:20,839
autographs and take pictures and my

124
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:22,399
favorite thing to do with guy is walk

125
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:25,660
into a restaurant because when he walks

126
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:29,149
into a restaurant that staffs go crazy

127
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:31,190
he is their culinary rockstar and he

128
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:34,550
will spend as much time with the Busboys

129
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:36,350
as he will with the head chef he loves

130
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:38,950
to support the next generation of food

131
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:40,970

132
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:43,760
including through all of his incredible

133
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:45,560
charities like cooking with kids he's

134
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,630
always thinking about how he can make a

135
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:50,240
difference whether it's changing lives

136
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:52,670
by showcasing an unknown restaurant on

137
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,830
one of his shows and trust me being

138
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:57,680
featured on diners drive-ins and dives

139
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:59,240

triage kitchens to feed the firefighters

145
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:16,430
all he does without any fanfare I have

146
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:18,649
asked him before can we publicize this

147
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:19,940
and he says no I don't want anything to

148
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:23,450

00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:35,500
it was a show that when I would pull

277
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:37,330

278
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:40,330

308
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,270

of a handful and I know that's hard to

447
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:54,000
imagine stop imagining I know but some

448
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,230
of my behavior when I was a kid and the

449
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,030
certain I wasn't allowed to go to

450
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:58,620
certain kids houses and go to the movies

451
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:00,180
with me and and people thought I might

452
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:03,420
end up on the streets well not this

453
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:04,860
street but yeah I grew up in a great

454
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:06,990
little town called Ferndale well I had a

455
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:08,520
ton of mentors and advisers and angels

456
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:09,750

501
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:02,790
wrangle me and kind of keep me in

502
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:04,170

drive up and down these streets we had

506
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:10,320
restaurants here in the area and I used

507
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:12,150

553
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:55,530
day and they voted me in to win the show

554
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:57,750
that's where you clap for them but

555
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:59,550
that's where I picked up a whole team I

556
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:02,220
mean I got like a cavalcade I got an

557
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:04,380
army of supporters with Kathleen and

558
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:05,910
Courtney and Alison and Brooke that's

559
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:08,010
where I met the great mark dissing one

560
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:11,000
of my favorite producers Brian Lando

561
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:14,460
Karen grin thaw and and and Danielle

562
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,740
Lauren but one person in particular that

563
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,520
had to go to all the painstaking work to

564
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,630
make this happen

565
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,820
I know they're gonna bring the hook out

566
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:22,350
and get me off the stage any minute but

567
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:25,440
I have to say thanks to Erica

568
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:33,480
Erica you are my rock star where is she

569
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:35,160
oh she already left and I also got to

570
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,960
meet a great mentor a guy that you know

571
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,250
kind of when I called Matthew or Matthew

572
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,230
and I first talked and he gave me so

573
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:42,000
much great advice before I had a chance

574
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:43,710
to meet Matthew I met the great Marc

575
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,230
summers who took a lot of time answered

576
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:47,550
a lot of phone calls a lot of phone

577
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:49,500
calls telling me what was going to come

578
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:50,820
and how to stay genuine be be who you

579
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,500
are says have you ever changed this is

580
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,580
not going to continue on with the

581
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:56,610
trajectory and that's the same thing

582
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:57,780
Matthew gave me same great advice I got

583
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:59,190
to hook up with the William Morris

584
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:00,780
Endeavor team and I have by the way

585
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:02,550
ladies and gentlemen I know Matthew or

586
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:04,980
argue it any of the celebrities here

587
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:07,590
will argue it but I have the two best

588
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:15,780
agents in the business Jason hotus and

589
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:17,129
Jeff Google so up to this point I'd

590
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:19,080
always been going with this idea of

591
00:34:17,129 --> 00:34:20,639
being lucky I got a big horseshoe tattoo

592
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:22,139
under my arm I thought man I'm lucky and

593
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,879
I would talk about being lucky and talk

594
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:26,070
about being lucky and one day this

595
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:27,840
another mentor a guy named Jack levar

596
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:29,550
the great lady Jack levar said would you

597
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:31,409
stop with the lucky thing because it's

598
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:32,730
not about luck he says it's about what

599
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:33,810
your mom and dad taught you early on

600
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:35,270
it's about hard work it's about

601
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:36,560
dedication it's about vision

602
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:37,790
it's about loving what you do and it's

603
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,919
about surrounding yourself with great

604
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:41,629
people and he says you build an army

605
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:44,210
he says you have an army of great people

606
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:46,399

00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:47,750
