1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,920
Two years, where you been?

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,840
Fighting crime.

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,060
I'll try not to
get offended.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,110
You broke the 200 bucks an hour
barrier.

5
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,840
That's why I'm not seeing you.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,430
It's a reason.

7
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,250
<i>But not the reason.</i>

8
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,340
You lit a cigarette,
and you're not smoking it.

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,800
I'm trying to quit.

10
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,720
So it's kind of a crutch.

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,580
I'm an addict, okay?

12
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,300
It's a crutch.

13
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,580
Kind of like having two drinks a night.
I'm not an addict.

14
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,530
Sure you are.
Let's review.

15
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,160
Why didn't you review
before I got here?

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,680
I did, but now I'm gonna review

17
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,530
With you.

18
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,120
Why is this so hard?

19
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,770
Are you still having two drinks
a night?

20
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:52,760
- Yes.
- Ever break your rule?

21
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,190
Couple of times.

22
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:55,620
Couple of times in two years?

23
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,140
- More or less.
- More?

24
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,340
Or less.

25
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,830
Last time we talked,

26
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:01,950
You said that, uh,
were seeing someone.

27
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,370
- I was.
- You said you liked her.

28
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,770
I still do.

29
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,860
So, you're still
seeing her?

30
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,610
I am not.

31
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,040
Have you talked to your wife?

32
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,890
Ex-wife.
I'm sure that's in there,

33
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,880
And no, I have not talked
to Jenn.

34
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:18,970
But you wanted to. Old habit.
I used to talk to her every day.

35
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,360
So, why'd you stop?

36
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,150
I ripped the phone
out of the wall.

37
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,840
Why'd you rip the phone
out of the wall?

38
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,830
Because it was pathetic.

39
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,190
So, since you stopped
talking to her,

40
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,340
- You've gotten drunk a couple of times.
- No.

41
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,660
I got drunk a couple of times
since I stopped seeing you.

42
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,120
And why are you seeing me now?

43
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,140
Because I got drunk
a couple of times

44
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,530
Since I stopped seeing you.

45
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,920
Ay.

46
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,410
You are a subversive
son of a bitch.

47
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:47,200
Nothing happens here.

48
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,050
You did too good

49
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,310
A job cleaning up dodge.

50
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,360
I lost my conscience.

51
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,790
That's definitely not in here.

52
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,180
You lost your conscience.

53
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,840
Is that kind of
a feeling you got?

54
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,260
- Yes.
- And you're frightened.

55
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,780
I've been afraid
of half the things I ever did.

56
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,200
But you're frightened now?

57
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,100
Yes.

58
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,090
Because?

59
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,550
Because I lost my conscience.

60
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:15,280
Fate wouldn't do this to me.

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,250
Took so long
to acknowledge a connection,

62
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,400
Admit there was a bond.

63
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,460

Healy signed off?

82
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:28,780
He did. I don't know why
you need paper.

83
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,870
I only work from paper.
How's the weather in florida?

84
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,520
He described it as predictable.

85
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:35,240
Did he seem upset
that I interrupted his vacation?

86
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,170
<i>I interrupted his vacation,

87
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:39,420
Must be staying
with his in-laws.

88
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,810
Last time got complicated--
healy's words.

89
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,670
Lieutenant greenstreet,

90
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,390
Under these rather
unique circumstances,

91
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,950
How do I address you?

92
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,380
As sydney.

93
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,770
As sydney, jesse.

94
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,590
Jesse.

95
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,150
<i>This is complicated.</i>

96
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,410
My words.

97
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,460
I'm undermanned.

98
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,220
That's sad.

99
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,200
Anyway, the price was right.

100
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,290
Why would you work
for expenses, jesse?

101
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,780
I still get my pension
from L.A. Homicide.

102
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,330
I don't need the money.
I need the work.

103
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:15,250
This is a small sampling
of open cases.

104
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,400
Some cold, some recent
but cold. Take your pick.

105
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,620
Thank you.

106
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,980
Raise your right hand.

107
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,940
You're kidding.

108
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,190
Well, last time, you ran away

Hello, jesse.

132
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,690
Hello, thelma.

133
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,820
Thanks, sam.

134
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,480
I think I owe you
an explanation.

135
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,510
You don't owe me
anything, Thelma.

136
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,530
How'd you know where
to find me, Jesse?

137
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:21,310
I pulled a guy over, a drunk,

138
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:24,560
And he says, "you remember
that babe who sold used cars

139
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,950
"at hasty's tasty's?

140
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,750
She's singing at a club
in Boston."

141
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,630
You think I'm a babe, Jesse?

142
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,260
No.

143
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,650
Yes.

144
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,730
You sing like an angel.

145
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,480
So you came here with a purpose?
Yes.

146
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,710
What purpose?

147
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:44,730
I'm thinking
about buying a car.

148
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,980
I don't do that anymore.

149
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,920
When the feds shuttered
hasty's place...

150
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:55,510
...I ran away.

151
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,940
From paradise?

152
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,300
From you.

153
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,910
You miss me?

154
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:07,050
No more than I would my eyes.

155
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,680
You're a curious man.

156
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,410
You're gonna make
every guy you meet

157
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,030
A little bit curious.

158
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,620
Jesse, I want you to know...

159
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,260
I'm seeing someone, Jesse.

160
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,320
Okay.

161
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,910
My ex.

162
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,550
Okay.

163
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,070
I understand.

164
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,870
I do.

165
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,520
You sing like an angel.

166
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,160
Hi, it's Ienn.
It's Jesse.

167
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,550
I'm not in, but your call
is important to me.

168
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:35,170
Please leave a message.

169
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,710
You're late.
You didn't answer my texts.
I don't text.

170
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,340
You're a dinosaur.
The average kid

171
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:20,020
On social media has an
attention span of eight seconds.

172
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,280
That's one second less
than a goldfish.

173
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,530
If you say so.

174
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,860
I missed my train.

175
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,490
Why'd you miss your train?

176
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:32,300
I had my dinner
in a bottle of scotch.

177
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,910
I need this job, sydney.

178
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,570
Anything else you need?

179
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:40,060
I need a car.

180
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,120
Why do you need a car?
As you well know,

181
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,100
Last time I used my police
cruiser to work in boston,

182
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,530
I got suspended.

183
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,020
Internal affairs wasn't
your calling,

184
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,250
By the way.

185
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,670
Homicide is.

186
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,230
I don't like the train.

187
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,890
Lets me think too much.

188
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:56,180
I'll get you a car.

189
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,570
Thank you, Sydney.
You're welcome, Jesse.

190
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,970
I don't know why I put that one
in there.

191
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,930
- You want certainty.
- Well,

192
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:07,990
We think we have the guy.

193
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,420
- You think?
- Yes.

194
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,410
You think your way
to a guess or a hunch--

195
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,730
That's not certainty.
An assumption isn't proof.

196
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,450
That's why you put it in there.

197
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,710
Well, why'd you pick it?

198
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:20,400
The boston ripper
case

199
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,760
Made a lot of headlines.

200
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,310
What happened to the dog?

201
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,540
What dog?

202
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,550
This dog.

203
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,570
Sitting next
to his owner's body.

204
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,110
Uh...

205
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,940
Dogs can't talk, Jesse.

206
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,430
No, but they listen pretty good.

207
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,590
We need
to get something straight.

208
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,340
Okay.

209
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,070
I'm not healy.

210
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,890
I know that.

211
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,050
I never slept with healy.

212
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:59,440
you're a bad boy.

213
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,820
I am.

215
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,620
Hello, richard.

216
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,940
I like to talk with my hands.

217
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,090
It's okay.

218
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,770
You're a tough guy.

219
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,760
I'm tough enough.

220
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:05,020
The hat. What's with the hat?

221
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,630
You got juice.

222
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:13,080
I do. Sit down.

223
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,770
You don't talk much.

224
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:26,220
I never found out anything
by listening to myself.

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,530
What do you think of my work?

226
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,030
Your work?

227
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,850
What do you think
of my avocation?

228
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:37,160
Your procedure is singular.

229
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:40,220
I'll take that...
As a compliment.

230
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,510
Jesse.

231
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,860
You're very skilled
at this, Jesse.

232
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,030
I am.

233
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,680
Are you the good cop

234
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:48,040
Or the bad cop?

235
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:50,660
That's not worthy of you,
Richard.

236
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:52,220
I'm both.

237
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,970
Your fourth victim.

238
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:57,400
I don't like that word.

239
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,320
What word would you prefer?

240
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,210
"recipient."

241
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:05,190
And I only have three.

242
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,120
You only confessed to three.

243
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,010
"in summary,

244
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,500
The fourth victim..."

245
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,990
Sorry, Richard,
that's what it says here.

246
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,420
"the fourth victim

247
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:17,070

<i>I don't like that word.</i>

257
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:45,000
What would you call it?

258
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,360
A public service.

259
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,010
Who wrote that?

260
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,870
The arresting detective.

261
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:54,490
Daniel Steven Leary.

262
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:56,710
An irish bricklayer
of a detective.

263
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:59,600
He's a decorated
police officer.

264
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,150
Almost got a rise
out of you, Jesse.

265
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:05,470
I'll be diplomatic.

266
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:08,420
He doesn't share your gift.

267
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:11,400
There's a profound reason
why you're here, jesse.

268
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,350
Stay with this.

269
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:18,270
Find out who did it.

270
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,230
I'm tired.

271
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:30,210
You never told me
what you thought of my work.

272
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,970
I think you're a sick
son of a bitch

273
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:35,750
And you should
already be dead.

274
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,110
Thanks, Laura.

275
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,420
Feed a cold,

276
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,880
Starve a fever.

277
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,380
Suit.

278
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,100
Guess you didn't
have a fever.

279
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,760
My sense is, you don't
even have a cold.

280
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,380
Another one, Jesse?

281
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,480
Only one more.

282
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,000
And what can I get you, Luther?

283
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,060
Usual, Laura.

284
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,260
Papaya and cranberry.

285
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,180
Straight up.

286
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,830
How'd you know
where to find me?

287
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,320
Small town.

288
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,810
What else do you know?

289
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,470
That you're not sick.

290
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,800
I called yesterday
and twice today.

291
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,390
I went to Boston.

292
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:19,240
You went to boston today?
And yesterday.

293
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,800
Thanks, Laura.

294
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,960
Papaya and cranberry.

295
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,550
I'll get my check.

296
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,520
My sense is, you're
working on something big.

297
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,340
You got a feeling.

298
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,730
You were thinking about it
when I came in.

299
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:37,320
I know how you get
when you're on to something.

300
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,280
You go inside yourself.

301
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,100
I can help, Jesse.

302
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,620
Somebody's got to run the shop.

303
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,280
And I got a lot
of vacation time coming.

304
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,570
Nothing happens here.

305
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,100
Crime could be
just around the corner.

306
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:53,310
All right.
I went to Boston...

307
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,540
To work for Healy.

308
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,960
I didn't say that.

309
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,050
I went to Boston to...
To follow a trail.

310
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:01,370
You're finishing
my sentences again.

311
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:03,860
Sorry, Jesse.

312
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,980
I went to Boston to--

313
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,070
I'm a little
embarrassed about this--

314
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,860
To enroll in some
university classes...

315
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,680
In police investigation.

316
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,430
In the psychology
of living alone.

317
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,200
Say no more.
I understand.

318
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,280
You didn't take
your police cruiser to Boston.

319
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,770
The train.

320
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,530
I like the train.
Lets me think.

321
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,030
What do you think
you'll be doing in ten years?

322
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:06,190
Who cares?

323
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,610
I know who you are.

324
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:09,770
You didn't answer my question.

325
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:11,100
I did.

326
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,820
I said I don't care.

327
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,770
No, you said "who cares?"
so who cares?

328
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:20,050
I care.

329
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:21,650
In ten years, you'll be...

330
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:23,470
23.

331
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:26,260
Well, in ten years,

332
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,250
If you're sitting
on that wall, smoking dope,

333
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,900
I'd arrest you.

334
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:33,820
But you wouldn't arrest
a confused 13-year-old girl.

335
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:36,440
Where'd you get it?
My mom has

336
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,400
A prescription, so it's legal.

337
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,220
It's legal for her.
It's illegal for you.

338
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,510
Did she give it to you?

339
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,840
No.

340
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,460
So you stole it.

341
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,380
What's your name?

342
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,670
If you make one up, I'll know.

343
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,970
How?

344
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:51,960
I'm the police chief,

345
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:53,220
I know everything.

346
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:55,450
Jenny O'neill.

347
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:58,430
You said you were confused.
What about?

348
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,090
My mom says you're a drinker.

349
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:04,240
Small town.

350
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,390
Why is drinking right
and smoking dope wrong?

351
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,090
I'm not in the right
and wrong business.

352
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:10,440
I'm in the legal
and illegal business.

353
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,530
Tell you what.
I won't

354
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,950
Arrest you if you go back
to school right now.

355
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,870
Don't have a note.

356
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:19,360
I'll call your mom.

357
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:21,490
she won't answer.

358
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:24,170
I'll call your principal.

359
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,510
I appreciate you seeing me,
Mr. Davies.

360
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,830
I hate to put you through this.

361
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,190
Then why do
you have to?

362
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,340
Well...

363
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,900
As I think you know,

364
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,850
We do have a
person of interest

365
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:06,270
In your wife's murder.
Richard steele.

366
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:08,790
Yes, yes, I know.
The man the press call

367
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:11,640
The boston ripper.
Catchy title.

368
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,400
And they like catchy titles.

369
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,650
The coroner's report
on your wife is virtually

370
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:18,110
Identical to the
three murders

371
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,440
That Richard Steele
confessed to.

372
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,520
But he denies any involvement

373
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:24,680
In Mrs. Davies' death.

374
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,170
What does this have to do
with paradise, chief Stone?

375
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:28,660
Absolutely nothing.

376
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,850
I have an extensive background
in homicide.

377
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:33,040
The state homicide commander
brought me in

378
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,130
To see if we could
close the books on this.

379
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:37,820
Mavis' killer
is already in prison.

380
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,940
That was never proven.

381
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,940
I don't think
there is one person

382
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:51,080
In boston who doesn't know
the ugly details of this mess.

383
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:52,910
Well, the details
employed by the killer

384
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:54,800
Were never made public, Mr. Davies.
I'm talking about

385
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,960
Mavis' sideline.

386
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,430
I found out my wife was
a prostitute in the papers.

387
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,560
Do you have any idea
what that's like?

388
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,340
I do not.

389
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:09,530
Well, I... I certainly
made enough money.

390
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,840
Why would she choose that?

391
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,490
That's a shrink question.

392
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,200
And mavis can't talk.

393
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,910
Marital problems?

394
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,700
Excuse me?

395
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,620
Often a change in behavior

396
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:32,750
Can be triggered
by marital problems.

397
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:35,240
I told everything I know
to detective leary. Please.

398
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,720
I kind of like to hear it from
the horse's mouth, so to speak.

399
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,780
Marital problems.

400
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:45,020
Our marriage was perfect.

401
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,870
I see.

402
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,860
Would you have
a personal photograph of mavis

403
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:52,250
That I could have?
The way I work on these things,

404
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,750
It would help me.

405
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:56,760
I destroyed
every photograph of Mavis.

406
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:59,090
Okay.

407
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:01,640
Have you come across
any new information

408
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,230
Or had any new ideas
that might be relevant?

409
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:07,550
Yes, I have, Chief Stone.

410
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:11,000
I have no intention
of helping you open me up

411
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,010
To another round
of that public circus.

412
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,830
Okay.

413
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,550
May I see your dog?

414
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,380
That was Mavis' dog.

415
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:24,790
And I might as well have been on
mars when I was in his presence.

416
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,420
I tried
with that dog.

417
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:30,400
I had to give him
to animal services for adoption.

418
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,820
He was a source of hurt.

419
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,810
Like the photographs.

420
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:36,600
That's right.

421
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:39,160
Good for you.

422
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,780
Sorry.

423
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,370
Chief Stone, this
is detective Dan Leary.

424
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:44,860
- Hi.
- Hi.

425
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:46,420
Hope I'm not stepping
on any toes here.

426
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,720
You're not.

427
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,310
It's officially an open case,

428
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,640
And Mavis Davies
deserves justice,

429
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,900
Just like the other

430
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,890
Three victims.

431
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:56,310
You know that Richard Steele
will say or do anything

432
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,870
To keep his name in the paper.

433
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:00,120
That was my take.

434
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,910
There isn't a day goes by

435
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,370
That I don't ask myself
why I couldn't give her justice.

436
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:08,880
Don't beat yourself up.
Five.

437
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,900
Excuse me?

438
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,960
That's the number of open cases
I had in L.A.

439
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,580
That I still carry around.
Five.

440
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,170
Is there a reason
that you landed on this one?

441
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:20,220
I don't know.
Something this brutal,

442
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:23,040
This premeditated,
requires consequence.

443
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,860
I'd like to work with you
on this.

444
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,850
You will not.
Your plate's full, detective.

445
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,300
You said Mavis

446
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:33,000
Deserves justice
like the other three.

447
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,490
Clearly you think
they're related.

448
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:36,810
I do.
All four were hookers,

449
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:39,400
All four were killed
exactly the same way.

450
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:43,210
You'll keep me up to date?

451
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:44,770
- We will. Thanks, dan.
- Okay,

452
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:46,360
Thanks.
Yeah. Thank you.

453
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:48,260
Good luck.

454
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,550
The murders stopped, Jesse.

455
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,240
So you think
mavis belongs

456
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,730
To richard steele.
What was the motive, Sydney?

457
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:02,780
We're never gonna know that.
For any of them, you know that.

458
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,540
Husband could have had one

459
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,930
If he knew she was a hooker
before she was murdered.

460
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,820
- You talked to him.
- I did.

461
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,410
What do you think?

462
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:13,630
He's hurt enough,
he's angry enough.

463
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:16,250
I want detailed daily reports

464
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,240
On this investigation,
Chief Stone.

465
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,600
Jesse.

466
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,750
You have a short leash
on this, Jesse.

467
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,720
Hello.

468
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,710
Crime could be
just around the corner.

469
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,270
I didn't wake you, did i?
I know you're a night owl,

470
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,590
So I figured you'd be up.

471
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,250
Exactly.

472
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,950
I was up, Jesse.

473
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,570
I met a kid today
on the way out of town.

474
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:47,630
She was sitting on a wall,

475
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:50,090
Smoking pot.
Who is she?

476
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:52,380
Her name's Jenny O'neill.
She lives in paradise.

477
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,970
What'd you do?
Well, I sent her

478
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:56,290
Back to school, but...

479
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:58,050
But your coply intuition
says there's more to it.

480
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:00,700
Exactly. There was
something in the way

481
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,230
She reacted when
I mentioned her mother.

482
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,990
Could you pay her mom a visit?

483
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,980
Oh, I might be able
to free up some time.

484
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:09,030
Could you do it in a way that
doesn't raise any red flags?

485
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:12,440
You know, like you're
following up on a...

486
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:13,710
Public disturbance
in the neighborhood?

487
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,700
There you go.

488
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,850
I'm sure I can check
with the school.

489
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:19,810
I got to go.

490
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,510
♪ ♪

491
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:53,250
♪ ♪

492
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,090
What's this about?
I ca

493
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,580
You can't tell me?
- That's correct.

494
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,270
Clearly, the dog
has issues.

495
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:17,760
What's his name?

496
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,980
Steve.

497
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,640
I do not understand

498
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,200
Why people must anthropomorphize
their canine partners.

499
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,790
There's comfort in it.

500
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:27,650
I'm interested in this dog.

501
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:29,600
I'm sorry. Steve
is scheduled.

502
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,260
For adoption?

503
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,190
<i>Goodness, no. He's scheduled.</i>

504
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:34,840
As I said,
the dog has issues.

505
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,270
He stopped eating

506
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:37,560
And he's unresponsive.

507
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:38,790
You're putting him down?

508
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,280
We prefer to think of it

509
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:42,470
As the canine is moving on
to a better place.

510
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,530
What place is that?

511
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,530
May I see your badge?

512
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:48,080
It's in a drawer.
Here's my card.

513
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,830
Sydney, this is highly unusual.

514
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,720
Actually, it's not my card.

515
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,710
It's the state
homicide commander's card.

516
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,470
She will explain my credentials.

517
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,790
Oh, never mind.

518
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:23,850
I don't see a need
for this distraction.
I will be brief.

519
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:27,240
Just so you know, I
consider my work a calling.

520
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,220
A vital, if, uh,
underappreciated calling.

521
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,650
Good for you.

522
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:34,700
So, lieutenant Greenstreet
has some doubt

523
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,690
About Richard Steele
being involved

524
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:38,850
With the fourth
Boston ripper case.

525
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:40,940
I didn't say that.
Your presence implies it.

526
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,500
It does not,

527
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,590
And I do not speak
for lieutenant Greenstreet.

528
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:46,380
Richard Steele
was not charged with

529
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,740
The murder of Mavis Davies.

530
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,500
He only confessed
to the first three,

531
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,480
So her murder is unresolved,
as I'm sure you know.

532
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,600
<i>As I'm sure you know,
chief Stone,</i>

533
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:58,020
The specific details
of the killer's method were not

534
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,450
Released to
the public.

535
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,840
No one else could
have reproduced them.

536
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,270
The same man

537
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:03,660
Committed all four
of those murders.

538
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,150
I would stake my reputation
on it.

539
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,450
You already have.

540
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:08,370
Look, the method of restraint,

541
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:10,030
The depth and angle
of the wound,

542
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:12,550
The length and strength of
the upward stroke, and...

543
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:15,040
The murders have stopped.

544
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,930
Everybody says that,
and you don't seem

545
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:19,650
To draw a conclusion
from that fact in your report.

546
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:21,910
That is not my job.

547
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:25,720
No, it's mine.
There was no toxicology report

548
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,940
On Mavis Davies in the file.

549
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,800
Oh, damn it!

550
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,890
He won't mind.

551
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,090
I think we're done here.

552
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,780
I'm sorry, but it appears
you did toxicology

553
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,670
On the first three victims,
but not Mavis.

554
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,020
Toxicology would be
a standard requirement

555
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,450
On a case like this.

556
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:49,540
Well, it's not
in the file, evan.

557
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,360
Well, I'm not the keeper
of the files.

558
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,220
Good lord, chief stone,
for a man who's supposed

559
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,080
To be so clever,
you act like an idiot.

560
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,030
That's one way to be clever.

561
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:59,490
And you don't seem upset
by that.

562
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,670
By a lost test result.

563
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:06,420
No.

564
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,120
Because...

565
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:17,700
The murders have stopped.

566
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,520
You're telling me
you came forward

567
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,020
And confessed
to three murders

568
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,740
Right after the fourth
one hit the papers.

569
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,170
Why would you do
that, Richard?

570
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,060
I wasn't about
to share my legacy, Jesse.

571
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:28,320
Your legacy?
My choice of words

572
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,170
Troubles you,
doesn't it, Jesse?
Not really.

573
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,730
What's troubling is
that it doesn't trouble you.

574
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:34,880
These people feed off
the worst in us.

575
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:36,870
They pollute their bodies
with poison

576
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,300
And prey on the innocent.

577
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,760
That's how you see it.

578
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,680
That's how
we should all see it.

579
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:44,600
That's why turning myself in
was worth the sacrifice.

580
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,160
That sacrifice would be?

581
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,890
My work wasn't finished.

582
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:51,930
Your first three were black,
Mavis was white.

583
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,430
Did that trouble you?

584
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:56,680
Please.
That is not my deal, Jesse.

585
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,500
<i>What is your deal, Richard?</i>

586
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,330
It would be wrong
for me to take credit

587
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:01,750
For something I didn't do.

588
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:04,370
Wouldn't be ethical.

589
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:08,350
You still don't understand,
do you?

590
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,340
I'd be ashamed if I did.

591
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:19,300
<i>Good luck with your problem,
jesse.</i>

592
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,410
I don't have a problem.

593
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,770
Sure you do.

594
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,830
well, the dinner
is on a friday.

595
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:56,620
Oh, of course.

596
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,210
Excuse me, father.

597
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:00,430
Ah.

598
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:03,520
Hello, Jesse.

599
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,780
We on for tomorrow night?

600
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,210
We are.

601
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:08,590
If you think it's a bad idea,

602
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,420
We don't have to.

603
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:12,340
<i>Do you think
it's a bad idea, Jesse?</i>

604
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,730
Why would I think
it's a bad idea?

605
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:16,490
Okay, listen,

606
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:17,980
I'll see you tomorrow night.

607
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:00,910
Where are you, Jesse?

608
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,590
Nowhere. Sorry.

609
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:07,340
Understood.

610
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,730
Didn't eat your steak.

611
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:13,350
I'm afraid I can't.

612
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:16,730
My sense is,
you're thinking about reggie.

613
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:19,120
Kind of.

614
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,640
You were the first
on the crime scene that night.

615
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,430
What'd you think

616
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:25,920
When you saw reggie sitting next
to his owner's body?

617
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:29,230
I wished he could talk.

618
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,420
Dogs can't talk.

619
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,610
Jenny's mom's a mess.

620
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:36,470
How bad?

621
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:39,090
She was drunk.
Not falling down drunk,

622
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:41,710
But just the
same. Believe me,

623
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,030
I know what I'm talking about.

624
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,360
Do you now?

625
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,680
I've seen it in my mom.

626
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:51,790
I see.

627
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:54,710
Any time her mother talked
about Jenny, there was an edge.

628
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,770
Do you think she knows
why you were really there?

629
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:59,590
My sense is she does not.

630
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:01,740
Then she doesn't.

631
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,800
What do you want me to do next?

632
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,450
Get me everything you can
on the mother.

633
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,880
On it.

634
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:56,970
Steak.

635
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,460
- You checking up on me?
- Jesse.

636
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:22,090
You checking up on me, Jesse?

637
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:25,730
No. I'm just sitting
here, thinking.

638
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,680
You ever talk
to your father?

639
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,990
I don't know who my father is.

640
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:37,640
Okay.

641
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,930
How's school?

642
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:41,990
School sucks.

643
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:44,340
Lot of things suck.

644
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,410
What happened?

645
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:54,860
My mom loves me.

646
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:57,410
Say it like you mean it.

647
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:59,870
I hate it there.

648
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:02,160
You hate it where?

649
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,810
Home.

650
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:11,250
I wouldn't want
to make you late for school.

651
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:26,070
I need a car.

652
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,590
I got you a car.
It's leaking oil

653
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,790
And overheating.

654
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:32,410
- Not my job.
- Might have something

655
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:34,860
To do with being pushed off
the road back to paradise.

656
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:37,320
- You had an accident?
- I'm not sure.

657
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,650
Tell me something, Jesse.

658
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:40,470
You don't look as though
I could, Sydney.

659
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:43,160
Is there something
I should know?

660
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:46,040
Could you run down the car
for me?

661
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,370
Did you get a license number?

662
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:49,890
I always get the license number.

663
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:01,930
Car was stolen
yesterday morning.

664
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:03,860
I guess
that explains the hit and run.

665
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,580
And you have reason to believe
it wasn't an accident.

666
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,210
I didn't say that.

667
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:09,060
Could you pull up Mavis Davies?

668
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:14,870
There was no toxicology report
in her physical file.

669
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:20,010
Not here, either.

670
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:21,700
The M.E. implied
he did one.

671
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:23,260
Implied?

672
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:25,190
As much as said so.

673
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:28,570
He is steeped
in bureaucratic belligerence.

674
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:31,750
Your point?

675
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,110
I think it's been scrubbed.

676
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,790
Oh, Sydney.

677
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:40,510
No, Jesse.

678
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:42,000
Yes, boss.

679
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:46,550
Not ethical.

680
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:48,070
I was just reminiscing.

681
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:51,860
Getting back
to reality for a moment.

682
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:54,340
I will only go as a visitor.

683
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:56,500
I talked
to Richard Steele again.

684
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,260
Any insight?
- Other than

685
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:00,410
I needed to take a shower?

686
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:02,170
He's relentless.

687
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:04,560
Insists he had nothing to do
with Mavis' murder.

688
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,050
Yeah, tell me something
I don't know.

689
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:09,940
If you don't like the answers
you're getting,

690
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:12,360
Check your premises.

691
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,180
<i>Most hookers are junkies.</i>

692
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:17,330
The streets are rough,
their pimps are rough.

693
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:19,590
Why'd you want to know?

694
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:21,350
You know more hookers
than I do.

695
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:22,840
That came out wrong.

696
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,700
I know what you
meant, Jesse.

697
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,850
Most of my girls
aren't hookers.

698
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:29,340
I know that.
- And not all hookers
are junkies.

699
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:31,200
Though a lot are.

700
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,250
Anyway, rehab's
not my business.

701
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:36,900
Love and support is my business.

702
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:40,290
How's business?
- Robust.

703
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:42,110
Funds are not,

704
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:43,740
But we have
our angels.

705
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:46,360
Gino fish is a benefactor,
but he's no angel.

706
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,950
No, he's not.

707
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:49,710
At least in the biblical sense.

708
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,450
It's good to see you, Jesse.

709
00:46:57,170 --> 00:46:59,560
And you.

710
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,120
It's been a while.

711
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,810
It has.

712
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:05,130
How you doing
with the nun thing?

713
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:08,150
Doing good. I'm good.

714
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:10,510
Honestly?

715
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:12,460
- Please.
- Well,

716
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:15,650
There are times--
this is stupid--

717
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:18,630
When I hear this voice
in my ear, and it turns out

718
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,120
To be my sunday school teacher
sitting on my shoulder.

719
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,810
What's he say?

720
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:26,400
Honestly?

721
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,890
Again, yes.

722
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:29,480
He says, "you sure as hell

723
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,470
"better have a damn good reason
for this

724
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:34,060
'cause you're not supposed
to have dinner with a nun."

725
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:36,180
We enjoy each other's company.

726
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:38,240
That's a good reason.

727
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,890
Thank you.

728
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:48,220
You gonna finish that?

729
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:51,440
It was delicious, but no.

730
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,620
You believe in fate?

731
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:44,480
- No.
- I think I do.

732
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,070
You think?
Know but can't prove.

733
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:49,230
The dog speaks to me.

734
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:51,050
- Dogs don't talk.
- No,

735
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:52,310
But he's speaking to me.

736
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:55,030
When I see this picture

737
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:57,150
Of a dog
who kind of looks like reggie

738
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:00,770
Sitting next
to his owner's body-- well...

739
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:02,990
What's this dog's name?
Steve.

740
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:05,650
Unusual name for a dog.
It is.

741
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:07,340
If you don't like the answers
you're getting,

742
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:09,000
Check your premises.
Did you tell me that?

743
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,650
I don't think so.

744
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:12,010
I must have thought it.

745
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:13,340
You're talking
a lot today.

746
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:14,930
Going easy on me?

747
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,430
There's a hard part.

748
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:17,850
Your cop hat still on?

749
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:19,650
It is, and we
have some time.

750
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:21,570
Okay. The murders have stopped.

751
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:23,890
That seems to be enough
for a lot of people.

752
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:25,650
- Greenstreet?
- I don't think so.

753
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:28,340
Murders could have stopped
for a lot of reasons.

754
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:33,680
Okay. What have you got?

755
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,170
I got Richard Steele.

756
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:37,260
He's a sick son of a bitch,
but he seems

757
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:38,720
To have some sort
of code of conduct.

758
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,580
I hope
you're not looking for a motive.

759
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:42,570
It'll drive you nuts.
We can't know.

760
00:49:42,570 --> 00:49:45,780
And the guy's doing life,
so what difference does it make?

761
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:47,440
Clearly, a lot to him.

762
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,200
It's not uncommon

763
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,420
For a sick son of a bitch
like him to have a standard.

764
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:54,240
Don't chase this, Jesse.

765
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,660
The dog speaks to me.
You're not walking

766
00:49:56,670 --> 00:49:58,720
The street
when you're walking the dog.

767
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,300
If you're not getting
the answers you want,

768
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:04,130
Check your premises.

769
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:07,540
All the victims
were prostitutes.

770
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:09,500
Steele confessed
to murdering three.

771
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,820
Steele had to commit
the fourth murder

772
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:15,140
Because no one else knew
the killer's methods.

773
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:18,690
The last one is
a false assumption.

774
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:22,800
Some people knew.

775
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:55,350
Yeah?

776
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:56,940
Mrs. O'neill?

777
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:59,130
I'm not married.
I'm Chief Stone.

778
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:00,650
I know who you are.

779
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:02,410
Can we talk?

780
00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:04,340
I got nothing to say.
I'm not here

781
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:05,760
As a police chief.

782
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,450
This is just between you and me.

783
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:09,540
Jenny doesn't know I'm here.
May I come in?

784
00:51:21,550 --> 00:51:24,970
You're on your way
to losing your daughter.

785
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:32,530
You're starting early.

786
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:34,260
I'm not going anywhere.

787
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:35,980
You know what I'm talking about.

788
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:37,940
What's that supposed to mean?

789
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:40,390
It means you lost your last job
'cause you're a drunk.

790
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:44,470
It means your unemployment is
running out soon, and i hope

791
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:45,900
It means you can see the bottom.

792
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:48,590
You don't know
what you're talking about.

793
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:51,070
Paradise is a small town.

794
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:53,260
I think you know
I'm an expert on the subject.

795
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:54,820
The subject?

796
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,910
Being a drunk.

797
00:51:56,910 --> 00:51:59,300
Oh.

798
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:01,520
Well, you can't know how I feel.

799
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,860
Don't kid a kidder.

800
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:09,220
I know how you feel.

801
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:14,160
Jenny's father
isn't even a memory.

802
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:17,980
You're her mother.

803
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:19,730
My mom died when I was eight.

804
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:22,060
Mothers are important.

805
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:27,030
Oh, what's this?

806
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:28,490
You can call it a voucher.

807
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:30,680
If that offends you,
let's just say

808
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,070
It's a scholarship.

809
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,660
You can only use it

810
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:36,450
In one place.
That's in there.

811
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:37,810
His name is Dr. Dix.

812
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:46,740
There was a time
I didn't like any part of me.

813
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,850
Now, on my good days, I'm okay.

814
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,330
You don't have any good days.

815
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:59,410
You live long enough,

816
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:02,090
You have regrets.

817
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:05,050
And the ones
that nag at you the most

818
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:08,000
Are the ones where you knew
you had a choice.

819
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:19,240
Last time I saw Jenny, she had
a mark on her left cheek.

820
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:21,470
You right-handed?

821
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:29,460
If I see something,
if I so much as feel something,

822
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:33,340
I will come back here with
my police chief hat on,

823
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:36,200
And you will go to jail,

824
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:41,740
And Jenny... With regret...

825
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:44,290
Will be on her way
to a foster home.

826
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:01,310

Mr. Fish is waiting
for you, Chief Stone.

829
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:11,360
I know our last meeting
didn't go very well,

830
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:13,750
And I see
you're still upset.

831
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,210
I'm sorry.

832
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,960
I questioned your intentions.

833
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:18,720
You asked me why.

834
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,540
And I said I've kissed
a few frogs in my day.

835
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:24,130
Are you a frog, Jesse?

836
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:28,710
I don't think so.

837
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:58,000
Perhaps you'd let me make it up
to you over a cup of coffee.

838

There's no education
in the second kick of a mule.

Thankfully,
those murders were solved.

Okay, let's get
something straight here.

904
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:53,320
I operate
a legitimate escort service.

905
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,310
Now, if one of
my girls chooses

906
00:58:55,310 --> 00:58:58,360
To go extracurricular,
that's on them.

907
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,950
Understood. Mavis Davies.

908
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:02,940
That was horrible.

909
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:05,330
And she was a nice kid.

910
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:08,740
Well, I mean, all I can tell you
is she wasn't working for me

911
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:10,730
That night.

912
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:13,850
I didn't think so.

913
00:59:18,030 --> 00:59:20,880
Did you know she was married?
Uh, no.

914
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:23,540
I don't want to know anything
about my girls' private lives.

915
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:25,530
Was there ever any kind
of incident

916
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:27,220
With any of her clients?

917
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:28,650
No. No.

918
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:30,410
Totally satisfied customers.

919
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:38,860
Select escorts.

920
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:41,820
Uh, oh, well,
no, I'm afraid

921
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:44,100
That she doesn't
work here anymore.

922
00:59:44,110 --> 00:59:46,890
Perhaps I could
suggest someone else?

923
00:59:46,890 --> 00:59:48,120
I see.

924
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:50,540
Well, please, uh, try us again.

925
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:53,860
The gift that keeps on giving.

926
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:56,110
Charlotte--
she was one

927
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:57,410
Of my best girls.

928
00:59:57,410 --> 00:59:59,030
But she was very close
to mavis, and...

929
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:01,890
And the murder just
absolutely just freaked her out.

930
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:03,740
Yeah. She quit.

931
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:06,790
Do you know
where I might find her?

932
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,980
All I can say is
that there was a client

933
01:00:08,990 --> 01:00:10,610
Who thought that he saw her.

934
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:13,590
You know, she was hostessing
for some beachfront café

935
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:15,950
Up the coast.

936
01:00:15,950 --> 01:00:16,910
Quite a step down, huh?

937
01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:18,940
Do you have a picture?

938
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:20,790
I can do better than that.

939
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:45,620
Hi, I'm Mavis.

940
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:48,010
I know it's hard
to meet new people.

941
01:02:48,010 --> 01:02:50,130
I know
because I'm in the same...

942
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:01,010
I know it's hard
to meet new people.

943
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:03,800
I know because I'm
in the same situation.

944
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:06,190
Maybe we could talk
over a nice dinner.

945
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:07,780
Call me.

946
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:12,120
You can reach me
at elite escorts.

947
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:29,570
Hi, I'm Charlotte.

948
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:32,330
I know it's hard
to meet new people. And I know

949
01:03:32,330 --> 01:03:35,480
Because I'm
in the exact same situation.

950
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:39,130
So maybe we can talk about it
over a nice dinner?

951
01:03:39,130 --> 01:03:40,850
Call me.

952
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:43,640
You can reach me
at select escorts.

953
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:22,090
Excuse me.

954
01:04:22,090 --> 01:04:24,540
Can I sit anywhere?

955
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:25,600
We're a little ahead
of the season,

956
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,130
So take your pick.

957
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:53,270
Can I get you something?

958
01:04:53,270 --> 01:04:55,920
You doing double duty?

959
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:57,740
We're new, and it's my place.

960
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:59,470
So, yes.

961
01:04:59,470 --> 01:05:02,750
I'd like a cup of coffee,
charlotte.

962
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:05,440
That's not my name.

963
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,260
What is your name?

964
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:08,760
Amelia.

965
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:10,050
Do you have a last name?

966
01:05:10,050 --> 01:05:11,380
Yes.

967
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:13,300
Do you have a name?

968
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:14,530
Jesse.

969
01:05:14,530 --> 01:05:16,060
And do you have a last name?

970
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:18,180
Stone.

971
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:20,270
Are you a cop, Jesse Stone?

972
01:05:20,270 --> 01:05:23,020
Do I look like a cop, Amelia?

973
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:25,410
You look like a man
who asks questions.

974
01:05:25,410 --> 01:05:27,730
Well, I have another question.

975
01:05:27,730 --> 01:05:29,720
It's a hypothetical.

976
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:33,300
Suppose I were a cop
and you were a Charlotte,

977
01:05:33,310 --> 01:05:35,100
You'd know
I was here

978
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:36,720
About Mavis Davies.

979
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,910
That's not a question,
Jesse Stone.

980
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:42,920
The killings stopped.

981
01:05:42,930 --> 01:05:45,680
That seems to be enough
for some people.

982
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:48,990
But it is not justice
for your friend

983
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,750
If the killer
is still out there.

984
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:56,560
I am a cop.

985
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:00,770
I'm good at what I do.

986
01:06:00,770 --> 01:06:03,590
There is no part of me
that thinks this is over.

987
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:15,200
Hope your business
gets better, Amelia.

988
01:06:39,290 --> 01:06:41,110
I just wanted to say hi.

989
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:42,470
You miss me?

990
01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:44,260
Like I would a bad cold.

991
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:45,690
That's sweet.

992
01:06:45,690 --> 01:06:47,610
It's nice that we've
become friends.

993
01:06:47,610 --> 01:06:50,300
You going home?

994
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:51,660
I hate it there.

995
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:53,750
You hate it there

996
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:55,700
Because you have
to be the grown-up.

997
01:06:57,890 --> 01:06:59,350
I talked to your mom.

998
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:01,540
About me?

999
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:03,200
About her.

1000
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:06,580
Yeah.

1001
01:07:06,590 --> 01:07:08,310
My mom has issues.

1002
01:07:10,070 --> 01:07:12,650
Your mom loves you.

1003
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:14,380
But you're gonna
have to be the grown-up

1004
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:15,940
For a little while longer.

1005
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:19,850
I can do that.

1006
01:07:19,850 --> 01:07:21,980
I know you can.

1007
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:25,820
I know you don't like me.

1008
01:07:25,830 --> 01:07:27,020
I didn't say that.

1009
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:33,020
Can you trust me, Jenny?

1010
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,740
Can i ask you a question?

1011
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:57,240
You can.

1012
01:07:57,240 --> 01:08:00,060
Would you tell your
friends about my place?

1013
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:01,550
Could you do that?

1014
01:08:01,550 --> 01:08:03,440
I could.

1015
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:05,530
Do you have some time?

1016
01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:07,850
I don't open till 11:30,

1017
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:10,470
So yeah.

1018
01:08:17,810 --> 01:08:20,990
Cops have problems with
professional escorts.

1019
01:08:20,990 --> 01:08:23,610
I never said that.
I don't.

1020
01:08:23,610 --> 01:08:25,100
Why'd you call me?

1021
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:27,690
I couldn't sleep last night.

1022
01:08:27,690 --> 01:08:30,540
Something I said?

1023
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:34,390
Do you really think
that somebody else killed her?

1024
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:35,720
I do.

1025
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:37,040
How do you know?

1026
01:08:37,050 --> 01:08:39,030
I don't know, I think.

1027
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,530
Do you think that I know?

1028
01:08:40,530 --> 01:08:42,720
I do not.

1029
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:45,730
But you know things
that I don't know.

1030
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:52,270
Was she still alive when he...?

1031
01:08:59,370 --> 01:09:01,030
Yes.

1032
01:09:01,030 --> 01:09:04,580
The things that must have been
going through her head.

1033
01:09:04,580 --> 01:09:07,400
Don't chase that.
That's not

1034
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:09,750
Somewhere you should go, amelia.
That's my job.

1035
01:09:15,430 --> 01:09:16,920
Will you help me?

1036
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,540
Yes.

1037
01:09:19,870 --> 01:09:21,160
Yes.

1038
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:24,310
Tell me about Mavis.

1039
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:29,120
She was my friend.

1040
01:09:29,130 --> 01:09:32,170
She always had time for me.

1041
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:34,860
And in my...

1042
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:36,290
Former line of work,

1043
01:09:36,290 --> 01:09:38,350
Friends are

1044
01:09:38,350 --> 01:09:40,440
Irreplaceable.

1045
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:43,090
Did you know she was married?

1046
01:09:43,090 --> 01:09:45,250
I did.

1047
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:46,740
After a hard day at the office,

1048
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:49,520
We would always have
a drink and talk.

1049
01:09:51,350 --> 01:09:53,010
After telling men
what they want to hear,

1050
01:09:53,010 --> 01:09:54,930
It's a way to decompress.

1051
01:09:54,930 --> 01:09:58,850
Right before you
lost your friend,

1052
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:01,070
What would you talk about?

1053
01:10:01,070 --> 01:10:02,830
We would tell each
other about our lives,

1054
01:10:02,830 --> 01:10:05,840
Our... You know,
our private lives,

1055
01:10:05,850 --> 01:10:07,830
But at a certain point,

1056
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:10,120
She would always
just cut it off.

1057
01:10:10,130 --> 01:10:13,770
Like, there was things that she
just wanted to hold private.

1058
01:10:13,770 --> 01:10:16,000
She said that
she was...

1059
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,320
Going to get
a divorce.

1060
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:20,270
She had been seeing someone.

1061
01:10:22,370 --> 01:10:24,720
And she was in love,

1062
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:26,710
Which is a common ambition
in our profession.

1063
01:10:26,710 --> 01:10:28,930
- Not a client?
- No.

1064
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:31,320
No, Mavis was

1065
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:33,970
Way too smart for that.

1066
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:35,670
She did tell me
that he was married,

1067
01:10:35,670 --> 01:10:37,160
He had kids,

1068
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:39,450
And that he
needed time.

1069
01:10:39,450 --> 01:10:41,440
Could I talk to him?

1070
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:42,960
I don't know him.

1071
01:10:42,970 --> 01:10:45,920
That's where she would
always cut it off.

1072
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:47,670
All I know
is that he was a-a cop

1073
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:49,930
And that he was
trying to find a way

1074
01:10:49,930 --> 01:10:51,420
That it wouldn't
hurt his career.

1075
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:55,900
Maybe you can just
tell me the why of that.

1076
01:10:55,900 --> 01:10:59,350
He got her a puppy.

1077
01:10:59,350 --> 01:11:02,000
She never
let it out of her sight.

1078
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:07,310
A red setter mix named Steve.

1079
01:11:07,310 --> 01:11:08,940
How'd you know?

1080
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:13,510
I just know.

1084
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:37,270
You satisfied yet?

1085
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:41,850
Not hardly, sydney.

1086
01:12:41,850 --> 01:12:43,180
They locate the stolen car

1087
01:12:43,180 --> 01:12:45,000
That pushed me off the road?

1088
01:12:45,010 --> 01:12:46,430
They have not.

1089
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:48,980
How's detective Leary
doing with this?

1090
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:50,480
He's pretty
consumed with it.

1091
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:52,400
I brief him
every day.

1092
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:54,160
Every day.

1093
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:56,310
You close?

1094
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:58,170
Not particularly.

1095
01:12:58,170 --> 01:12:59,800
He's good at
what he does.

1096
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:01,820
I mean, he did break
the boston ripper case.
- Well,

1097
01:13:01,820 --> 01:13:03,410
Richard steele confessed.

1098
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:05,240
Healy brought him over
from vice.

1099
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:06,300
I know.

1100
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:07,660
Why do you know?

1101
01:13:07,660 --> 01:13:09,320
What's a good homicide detective

1102
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:10,810
Doing working vice?

1103
01:13:10,810 --> 01:13:12,370
Paying penance.

1104
01:13:12,370 --> 01:13:14,920
Apparently he had issues.
What issues?

1105
01:13:14,930 --> 01:13:16,380
I know you, Jesse.
There's more behind this

1106
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:17,510
Than "how's
he doing?"

1107
01:13:17,510 --> 01:13:19,170
Humor me.
What issues?

1108
01:13:19,170 --> 01:13:21,130
Apparently he couldn't
keep it in his pants.

1109
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:23,350
His wife, a real piece of work,
by the way, blew the whistle

1110
01:13:23,350 --> 01:13:24,980
On him. She's prominent
in the community,

1111
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:26,470
Comes from a
lot of money,

1112
01:13:26,470 --> 01:13:29,850
She goes right
to the supervisor of detectives.

1113
01:13:29,850 --> 01:13:31,840
Why do you know his history?

1114
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:34,760
Mavis davies had an arrest
for prostitution,

1115
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:36,250
But no charges were filed.

1116
01:13:36,260 --> 01:13:38,310
It was when Leary
was working vice.

1117
01:13:38,310 --> 01:13:40,170
- So?
- So, if I could

1118
01:13:40,170 --> 01:13:41,930
Connect Mavis to Leary, it means

1119
01:13:41,930 --> 01:13:43,620
He knew her
well before she was murdered.

1120
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:46,800
This isn't tracking.
Oh, yeah, it is,

1121
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:49,520
Because if he did know her,
he certainly never told anybody.

1122
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:51,410
Did he arrest her?

1123
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:54,000
Her file shows the arrest

1124
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,420
But not the arresting officer.

1125
01:13:56,420 --> 01:13:59,410
I think it's been scrubbed.

1126
01:13:59,410 --> 01:14:01,560
You getting enough sleep?
I never get enough sleep.

1127
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:04,520
Probably also scrubbed
from NCIC. Check NLETS.

1128
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,010
NLETS?

1129
01:14:06,010 --> 01:14:08,000
National law enforcement
and teletype service.

1130
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,090
I don't have a teletype.

1131
01:14:10,090 --> 01:14:12,310
A lot of cops don't know
it still exists.

1132
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:13,970
I think they changed it
to "telecommunications."

1133
01:14:13,970 --> 01:14:16,460
I prefer "teletype."

1134
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:18,610
You are a dinosaur.
Can't scrub
something

1135
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:20,310
If you don't know it exists.

1136
01:14:20,310 --> 01:14:23,130
My guess is,
mavis' missing

1137
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:25,350
Toxicology report
came back clean.

1138
01:14:25,350 --> 01:14:26,910
Why does that matter?

1139
01:14:26,910 --> 01:14:28,370
It matters to Richard Steele.

1140
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:32,710
Stay right where you are.

1141
01:14:40,110 --> 01:14:41,540
Mavis Davies.

1142
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:44,320
Arrested in february
of last year.

1143
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:47,080
No charges filed.
Arresting officer...

1144
01:14:50,390 --> 01:14:52,650
Detective Daniel Steven Leary.

1145
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:57,230
I checked the booking blotter

1146
01:14:57,230 --> 01:14:59,520
At the precinct
where leary worked vice.

1147
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:02,240
The page was torn out.

1148
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:03,830
No charges
were filed.

1149
01:15:03,830 --> 01:15:06,050
He let her go.
I think he fancied her.

1150
01:15:06,050 --> 01:15:08,540
All we know is he knew her.

1151
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:10,200
<i>Daniel Steven Leary.</i>

1152
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:11,690
He gave her a puppy.

1153
01:15:11,690 --> 01:15:13,280
She named him Steve.

1154
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:15,340
Okay, then let's just
throw him in prison.

1155
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:17,330
Sydney, she was in love
with the guy.

1156
01:15:17,330 --> 01:15:20,110
I think she was becoming
a problem for him.

1157
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:21,810
I want you to lock him out.

1158
01:15:21,810 --> 01:15:24,100
You want me to lock him out.
Yes.

1159
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:27,450
As of now, I will work on
who pushed me off the road.

1160
01:15:29,470 --> 01:15:31,960
Look, he
knew Mavis

1161
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:34,510
And went to great lengths
to hide it even after

1162
01:15:34,510 --> 01:15:36,570
She was
murdered.

1163
01:15:36,570 --> 01:15:41,540
And he knew the specific m.O.
Of the killer.

1164
01:15:42,540 --> 01:15:45,190
I'm just saying.

1165
01:15:45,190 --> 01:15:48,940
It would take a cold bastard
to do to Mavis

1166
01:15:48,940 --> 01:15:51,360
What was done
to the other three.

1167
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:54,310
Premeditated murder's
cold bastard work.

1168
01:15:58,890 --> 01:16:00,880
Morning, suit.

1169
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:02,770
Morning, Jesse.

1170
01:16:02,780 --> 01:16:04,530
Thank you.

1171
01:16:04,530 --> 01:16:06,360
Donut? They're coply.

1172
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:08,510
My body's a temple.

1173
01:16:08,510 --> 01:16:10,470
How are your classes going?

1174
01:16:10,470 --> 01:16:11,860
Classes?

1175
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:14,480
Oh, my classes. Very well.
Very fulfilling.

1176
01:16:14,490 --> 01:16:15,880
You're working on something
in Boston.

1177
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:17,140
I feel it in my cells.

1178
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:18,360
I kind of am.

1179
01:16:18,370 --> 01:16:19,960
In between classes.

1180
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:21,350
Why do you do that?

1181
01:16:21,350 --> 01:16:22,980
Do what?

1182
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:24,430
You withhold. Why?

1183
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:29,210
I'm not sure.

1184
01:16:31,770 --> 01:16:34,060
I talked to Jenny's mom.

1185
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:35,850
Thank you. And?

1186
01:16:35,850 --> 01:16:38,570
I think Dr. Dix put a dent
in her denial.

1187
01:16:38,570 --> 01:16:39,830
She wants
to go to rehab.

1188
01:16:39,830 --> 01:16:40,990
That's a good thing.

1189
01:16:40,990 --> 01:16:42,350
Says she can't afford it.

1190
01:16:42,350 --> 01:16:44,010
She's on scholarship.

1191
01:16:44,010 --> 01:16:45,230
<i>Can you afford it?</i>

1192
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:47,560
I'll have to.

1193
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:49,020
She doesn't know what to do
about Jenny.

1194
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:52,000
Just love her.

1195
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,990
They might put her
in a foster home.

1196
01:16:53,990 --> 01:16:55,780
they could.

1197
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:56,910
She's worried.

1198
01:16:56,910 --> 01:16:58,730
It's about time.

1199
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:05,630
Well, time for me
to lie in wait.

1200
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:07,720
Speed trap?
For the greater good.

1201
01:17:07,730 --> 01:17:10,180
I hate these things.

1202
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:17,840
Amelia
Hello, Jesse Stone.
I got your text.

1203
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:21,460
I can meet you before work,
but I can't be there at 10:00.

1204
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:23,220
I got to pick up supplies.

1205
01:17:23,220 --> 01:17:24,480
10:15 okay?

1206
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:26,470
I don't text.

1207
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,650
It's Jesse.
Don't go to that meeting.

1208
01:17:49,660 --> 01:17:52,440
Stay away from there.
You're in danger.

1209
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:56,950
Amelia?
- Yes.

1210
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:03,250
It's nice to put a face
to the name.

1211
01:18:03,260 --> 01:18:05,640
Jesse's talked
a lot about you.

1212
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:08,660
I'm detective Dan Leary,

1213
01:18:08,660 --> 01:18:11,650
State homicide.
Jesse's been detained,

1214
01:18:11,650 --> 01:18:13,270
And we had a break
in Mavis davies' murder.

1215
01:18:13,270 --> 01:18:14,800
He asked me to take you to him.

1216
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:18,180
Oh, I'm sorry.
I have to open up the café.

1217
01:18:18,180 --> 01:18:19,840
It's police business, please.

1218
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:22,330
I'll just let my assistant know.

1219
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:23,850
Please.

1220
01:18:23,860 --> 01:18:25,680
Okay.

1221
01:18:57,390 --> 01:18:57,950
Stop!

1222
01:19:23,470 --> 01:19:24,190
I'll kill her!

1223
01:19:24,190 --> 01:19:25,190
To what end?

1224
01:19:25,190 --> 01:19:26,420
You're done.

1225
01:19:26,420 --> 01:19:29,430
You kill us both,
you're still done.

1226
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:31,820
Step away.

1227
01:20:28,420 --> 01:20:31,400
You son of a bitch!

1228
01:20:51,370 --> 01:20:54,790
Some cases are hard,
some are easy.

1229
01:20:54,790 --> 01:20:56,510
This one was easy.

1230
01:20:56,510 --> 01:20:58,670
He made it easy.

1231
01:20:58,670 --> 01:21:00,790
Did you have
a choice?

1232
01:21:02,810 --> 01:21:05,630
No.

1233
01:21:05,630 --> 01:21:09,080
That's one cold bastard.

1234
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:12,000
you okay?

1235
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,820
Oh, you know me, Sydney.

1236
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:16,450
Yes, I do, Jesse.

1237
01:21:18,470 --> 01:21:20,660
I'm gonna need a new car.

1238
01:21:20,660 --> 01:21:23,280
That would make three.

1239
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:28,320
How's she doing?

1240
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:31,270
She's tough.

1241
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:33,230
Wasn't about to
become a victim.

1242
01:21:33,230 --> 01:21:35,450
- It's sad.
- What's sad?

1243
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:37,110
Richard Steele
will feel vindicated.

1244
01:21:37,110 --> 01:21:39,400
I could care less.

1245
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,030
He ought to be dead.

1246
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:56,580
What are you thinking about?

1247
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:00,400
Mavis.

1248
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:11,350
Where'd you
learn that move?

1249
01:22:13,370 --> 01:22:16,750
My dad.

1250
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:20,400
He made me take
self-defense classes.

1251
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:24,620
Fathers are important.

1252
01:22:33,610 --> 01:22:36,360
Happens to cops a lot.

1253
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:40,570
They control themselves,
do what they have to do.

1254
01:22:40,570 --> 01:22:45,150
Afterwards, they become
part of the debris.

1255
01:22:45,150 --> 01:22:46,870
See what I mean?

1256
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:55,000
Steve's my new roommate.

1257
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,390
What?

1258
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,880
Mavis' dog.

1259
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:00,910
Oh.

1260
01:23:00,910 --> 01:23:03,630
Maybe you'd like to
come see him sometime.

1261
01:23:03,630 --> 01:23:06,050
I'd like that.

1262
01:23:10,490 --> 01:23:12,380
Thank you.

1263
01:23:13,450 --> 01:23:15,300
For what?

1264
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:20,110
Getting justice for my friend.

1265
01:23:36,070 --> 01:23:39,320
I know
you must have a last name.

1266
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:45,450
Hope.

1267
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:49,300
Amelia hope.

1268
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,720
That's a nice name.
