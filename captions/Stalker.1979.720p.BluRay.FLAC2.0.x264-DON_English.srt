20
00:03:40,163 --> 00:03:44,304
“What was it?
A meteorite?

21
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:49,057
A visit of inhabitants
of the cosmic abyss?

22
00:03:49,298 --> 00:03:53,224
One way or another,
our small country

23
00:03:53,468 --> 00:03:56,565
has seen the birth of a miracle -
the Zone.

24
00:03:56,763 --> 00:03:59,860
We immediately sent troops there.

25
00:04:00,058 --> 00:04:02,110
They haven't come back.

26
00:04:02,311 --> 00:04:06,451
Then we surrounded the Zone
with police cordons...

27
00:04:06,648 --> 00:04:10,789
Perhaps, that was the right thing to
do. Though, I don't know...“

28
00:04:10,986 --> 00:04:14,083
From an interview with Nobel Prize
winner, Professor Wallace.

29
00:10:13,932 --> 00:10:15,735
Why did you take my watch?

30
00:10:19,354 --> 00:10:21,739
Where are you going, I'm asking you?

31
00:10:25,235 --> 00:10:29,292
You gave me your word
and I believed you.

32
00:10:34,203 --> 00:10:36,836
All right, you're not thinking about
yourself, but what about us?

33
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,510
Did you think about your child?

34
00:10:42,711 --> 00:10:46,673
She's just getting used to you,
and you start it again!

35
00:10:51,136 --> 00:10:54,767
You've made an old woman of me.
You've ruined my life.

36
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,821
Not so loud, you'll wake up
Monkey.

37
00:10:59,937 --> 00:11:03,116
I can't wait for you forever.
I'm going to die!

38
00:11:17,454 --> 00:11:19,340
You wanted to start working!

39
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,889
You've been promised
a normal human work!

40
00:11:28,173 --> 00:11:29,680
I'll be back soon.

41
00:11:31,635 --> 00:11:33,438
You'll be back to prison!

42
00:11:33,887 --> 00:11:36,391
Though this time you'll get
ten years, not five!

43
00:11:36,598 --> 00:11:40,905
And for ten years you will have
neither your Zone, nor anything!

44
00:11:41,895 --> 00:11:45,656
And I'll be dead in the meantime.

45
00:11:47,693 --> 00:11:51,323
Oh God, for me it's prison
everywhere!

46
00:11:55,075 --> 00:11:56,878
. Let me go!
" No!

47
00:11:58,036 --> 00:11:59,673
Let go, I said!

48
00:12:09,923 --> 00:12:13,554
Go!
And may you rot there!

49
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,226
Be damned the day
when I met you, bastard!

50
00:12:20,392 --> 00:12:23,986
God himself has cursed you
by giving you this child!

51
00:12:25,397 --> 00:12:28,245
And me too, because of you, jerk!

52
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:18,457
My dear,
our world is hopelessly boring.

53
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:23,084
Therefore, there can be no telepathy,
or apparitions, or flying saucers,

54
00:13:23,288 --> 00:13:25,507
nothing like that.

55
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:30,971
The world is ruled by cast-iron laws,
and it's insufferably boring.

56
00:13:31,171 --> 00:13:33,426
Alas, those laws are never violated.

57
00:13:33,632 --> 00:13:35,518
They don't know how to be violated.

58
00:13:37,469 --> 00:13:41,941
So don't even hope for a UFO,
that would have been too interesting.

59
00:13:42,558 --> 00:13:46,271
And how about the Bermuda Triangle?
You're not going to deny...

60
00:13:46,478 --> 00:13:50,440
lam. There is no Bermuda Triangle.

61
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:55,489
There's only Triangle ABC that equals
Triangle A-prim, B-prim, C-prim.

62
00:13:56,154 --> 00:13:59,666
Do you feel the boredom
contained in this assertion?

63
00:14:00,909 --> 00:14:03,211
To live in the Middle Ages was
interesting.

64
00:14:03,954 --> 00:14:08,260
Every home had its house-spirit,
and every church had its God.

65
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:11,840
People were young!
Now every fourth is an old person.

66
00:14:12,921 --> 00:14:15,306
It's so boring, my angel.

67
00:14:15,674 --> 00:14:18,604
But you said that the Zone

68
00:14:18,802 --> 00:14:21,222
was the product of a superior
civilization...

69
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:25,985
It must be boring, too,
all those laws, triangles,

70
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,072
and no house spirits,
and no God, that's for certain.

71
00:14:31,607 --> 00:14:35,617
Because if God is also
a triangle,

72
00:14:36,904 --> 00:14:39,122
then I don't know what to think.

73
00:14:42,951 --> 00:14:45,455
It's for me! Great!

74
00:14:45,662 --> 00:14:48,343
Goodbye, my dear friend.

75
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:52,512
This lady was so kind as to agree
to go with us to the Zone.

76
00:14:52,711 --> 00:14:55,345
She's a very courageous woman.
Her name is...

77
00:14:56,715 --> 00:14:58,685
I beg your pardon, your name is"?

78
00:14:59,301 --> 00:15:01,805
Are you really a stalker?

79
00:15:08,352 --> 00:15:10,155
Wait... I'll explain everything.

80
00:15:19,196 --> 00:15:20,204
Go...

81
00:15:28,956 --> 00:15:30,047
What a cretin!

82
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,391
You did get drunk after all.

83
00:15:37,381 --> 00:15:39,682
Me? What do you mean?

84
00:15:39,883 --> 00:15:43,596
I had a drink, like one half
of the population does.

85
00:15:43,804 --> 00:15:47,766
The other half gets drunk.
Including women and children.

86
00:15:48,392 --> 00:15:49,780
I just had a drink though.

87
00:16:11,874 --> 00:16:14,175
Damn it, what a mess here.

88
00:16:29,141 --> 00:16:30,944
Go on, drink. We've got time.

89
00:16:33,854 --> 00:16:37,116
How about a glass for the road?

90
00:16:39,151 --> 00:16:40,574
What do you think?

91
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:55,966
Take it away.

92
00:16:56,502 --> 00:17:01,342
I see. Dry law.
Alcoholism is a scourge of mankind.

93
00:17:02,007 --> 00:17:03,597
All right, we'll drink beer.

94
00:17:06,595 --> 00:17:07,983
Is he with us?

95
00:17:09,223 --> 00:17:12,569
Never mind, he'll sober up.
He needs to go there, too.

96
00:17:20,776 --> 00:17:22,828
Are you really a professor?

97
00:17:24,071 --> 00:17:25,412
If you don't mind.

98
00:17:25,614 --> 00:17:29,956
Then let me introduce myself.
My name is...

99
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,583
Your name is Writer.

100
00:17:32,746 --> 00:17:34,632
Well. And what is my name?

101
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,592
Yours? Professor.

102
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:41,849
I see. I'm a writer,

103
00:17:42,047 --> 00:17:44,977
so, naturally, everyone calls me
Writer for some reason.

104
00:17:45,634 --> 00:17:48,980
- And what do you write about?
- About the readers.

105
00:17:49,179 --> 00:17:51,765
Obviously, there's nothing else
one should write about.

106
00:17:51,974 --> 00:17:54,987
One should write about nothing at all.

107
00:17:56,144 --> 00:17:59,906
And what are you? A chemist?

108
00:18:01,275 --> 00:18:02,616
A physicist rather.

109
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:06,366
That must be boring, too.
Searching for the truth.

110
00:18:07,781 --> 00:18:12,171
It's hiding and you keep searching
for it.

111
00:18:12,369 --> 00:18:16,331
You dig in one place - eureka!
The nucleus is made of protons.

112
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,592
You dig in another - great!

113
00:18:18,792 --> 00:18:22,672
Triangle ABC equals
Triangle A-prim, B-prim, C-prim.

114
00:18:23,672 --> 00:18:25,558
With me it's quite different.

115
00:18:26,967 --> 00:18:32,222
While I am digging for the truth,
so much happens to it

116
00:18:32,723 --> 00:18:34,942
that instead of discovering the truth

117
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:39,105
I dig up a heap of, pardon...
I'd better not name it.

118
00:18:45,402 --> 00:18:46,743
You're lucky!

119
00:18:47,571 --> 00:18:50,668
But imagine some antique pot
displayed in a museum.

120
00:18:51,116 --> 00:18:53,252
It was used at its time
as a receptacle of food leftovers,

121
00:18:54,077 --> 00:18:57,625
but now it's an object of
universal admiration

122
00:18:57,831 --> 00:19:00,928
for its laconic pattern
and unique form.

123
00:19:01,668 --> 00:19:03,258
Everyone goes oh! and ah!

124
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,143
And suddenly it turns out
that it's not antique at all,

125
00:19:09,218 --> 00:19:13,180
that some joker has palmed it off
on the archeologists

126
00:19:14,348 --> 00:19:15,605
just for fun.

127
00:19:15,807 --> 00:19:20,114
Strange as it may seem, the admiration
dies off. Those connoisseurs...

128
00:19:20,437 --> 00:19:22,738
Is it what you think about
all the time?

129
00:19:25,275 --> 00:19:26,616
God forbid!

130
00:19:27,444 --> 00:19:29,864
In fact, I don't think much.
It's not good for me.

131
00:19:30,489 --> 00:19:35,246
It's impossible to write, thinking
all the time of success or failure.

132
00:19:35,452 --> 00:19:40,802
Naturlich! But if no one is going
to read me in one hundred years,

133
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:43,051
why the hell should I write at all?

134
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:49,926
Tell me, Professor, why did you let
yourself be mixed up in all this?

135
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,772
What do you need the Zone for?

136
00:19:53,887 --> 00:19:57,066
I'm a scientist in some sense.

137
00:19:59,601 --> 00:20:01,155
But what do you need it for?

138
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,451
You're an "in" writer.
r</i>

139
00:20:05,691 --> 00:20:08,538
Women must be running after you
in flocks.

140
00:20:08,735 --> 00:20:13,374
My inspiration has been lost,
Professor. I go begging for it.

141
00:20:15,242 --> 00:20:17,128
Have you been used up?

142
00:20:17,327 --> 00:20:21,290
What?
Yes, I guess, in a way.

143
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,679
Do you hear it? Our train.

144
00:20:34,261 --> 00:20:37,109
- Have you taken the roof off the car?
- Yes, I have.

145
00:20:50,277 --> 00:20:56,909
Luger, if I don't come back,
call on my wife.

146
00:21:12,925 --> 00:21:15,428
Damn it, I forgot to buy cigarettes.

147
00:21:17,304 --> 00:21:18,894
Don't go back.

148
00:21:20,224 --> 00:21:22,394
- Why?
- You must not.

149
00:21:23,185 --> 00:21:25,522
- You're all like this.
- Like what?

150
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,532
Believing such nonsense.

151
00:21:29,983 --> 00:21:32,119
Well, I'd better leave it for a rainy
day.

152
00:21:35,781 --> 00:21:37,584
Are you really a scientist?

153
00:23:15,214 --> 00:23:16,222
Down!

154
00:23:20,344 --> 00:23:21,352
Don't move!

155
00:23:52,292 --> 00:23:54,013
Go and look, is there anyone there?

156
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,936
Move it, for God's sake!

157
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,108
There's no one there.

158
00:24:09,935 --> 00:24:11,323
Go to the other exit.

159
00:24:38,714 --> 00:24:40,386
Where on earth did you look, Writer?

160
00:27:50,322 --> 00:27:54,628
- You didn't forget the jerry can?
- No. It's full.

161
00:28:08,632 --> 00:28:10,851
Everything I told you before...

162
00:28:12,094 --> 00:28:16,519
is a lie.
I don't give a damn about inspiration.

163
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:24,066
How would I know
the right word for what I want?

164
00:28:24,898 --> 00:28:28,576
How would I know that actually
I don't want what I want?

165
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:33,626
Or that I actually don't want
what I don't want?

166
00:28:34,783 --> 00:28:36,835
They are elusive things:

167
00:28:37,035 --> 00:28:39,290
the moment we name them,
their meaning disappears,

168
00:28:39,496 --> 00:28:43,886
melts, dissolves
like a jellyfish in the sun.

169
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:48,675
My conscience wants vegetarianism
to win over the world.

170
00:28:49,298 --> 00:28:52,311
And my subconscious is yearning
for a piece of juicy meat.

171
00:28:53,635 --> 00:28:55,107
But what do I want?

172
00:28:57,973 --> 00:28:59,527
World domination.

173
00:28:59,725 --> 00:29:00,401
Quiet!

174
00:29:04,855 --> 00:29:06,907
Why a diesel locomotive in the Zone?

175
00:29:07,274 --> 00:29:10,371
It services the outpost.
It won't go any farther.

176
00:29:11,528 --> 00:29:13,165
They don't like going there.

177
00:29:19,369 --> 00:29:22,466
Take your places!
Everybody here?

178
00:29:25,209 --> 00:29:29,135
The guards have arrived.
Tell them to turn the TV off.

179
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:37,538
Hurry!

180
00:31:33,879 --> 00:31:39,052
Go look if there's a trolley
on the tracks.

181
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,518
What trolley?

182
00:32:04,743 --> 00:32:06,416
Go back, I'll do it.

183
00:34:03,237 --> 00:34:04,245
The jerry can!

184
00:34:30,264 --> 00:34:31,272
Give it to me!

185
00:34:33,642 --> 00:34:36,323
Get rid of your knapsack,
it's hampering you.

186
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,988
You may travel light, if you wish,
as if going for a stroll.

187
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,997
If someone gets hit,
don't shout or rush about.

188
00:34:45,195 --> 00:34:46,406
If they see you, they'll kill you.

189
00:34:47,573 --> 00:34:51,167
When everything settles down,
crawl back to the outpost.

190
00:34:51,368 --> 00:34:52,460
They'll pick you up in the morning.

191
00:35:09,178 --> 00:35:10,898
Can they catch up with us?

192
00:35:11,096 --> 00:35:14,275
They fear it like the plague.

193
00:35:15,809 --> 00:35:16,817
Fear what?

194
00:39:37,529 --> 00:39:41,123
Here we are... home, at last.

195
00:39:45,412 --> 00:39:46,504
How quiet it is.

196
00:39:49,583 --> 00:39:55,385
This is the quietest place in
the world. You'll see for yourselves.

197
00:39:57,674 --> 00:40:01,020
So beautiful here.
Not a single soul here.

198
00:40:01,845 --> 00:40:03,019
What about us?

199
00:40:03,222 --> 00:40:06,235
Three men can't spoil the place
in one day.

200
00:40:06,433 --> 00:40:08,604
Why? They can.

201
00:40:12,731 --> 00:40:17,287
It's strange that flowers don't
smell. Or have I...

202
00:40:18,278 --> 00:40:19,785
Do you feel anything?

203
00:40:19,988 --> 00:40:22,325
I feel the stench of the bog.

204
00:40:22,533 --> 00:40:25,083
No, that's the river. There's a river
here.

205
00:40:26,703 --> 00:40:32,505
There was a flower-bed nearby,
but Porcupine had trampled it down.

206
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:37,969
The smell lingered
for many years though.

207
00:40:39,716 --> 00:40:42,302
Why did he do it?

208
00:40:43,303 --> 00:40:44,312
I don't know.

209
00:40:46,515 --> 00:40:48,318
I asked him why, too.

210
00:40:49,476 --> 00:40:51,528
And he said:
“You'll understand later.“

211
00:40:53,647 --> 00:40:57,870
I think he just came to hate the Zone.

212
00:41:01,822 --> 00:41:05,250
Porcupine, that's his name?

213
00:41:06,076 --> 00:41:08,627
A nickname, like yours.

214
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:13,427
He had been taking people to the Zone
for years, and no one could stop him.

215
00:41:15,002 --> 00:41:18,964
He was my teacher.
He opened my eyes.

216
00:41:22,217 --> 00:41:26,689
He was called Teacher then,
not Porcupine.

217
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:33,904
Then something happened to him,
something broke in him.

218
00:41:36,023 --> 00:41:38,075
Though I think
he was punished.

219
00:41:38,567 --> 00:41:42,363
Will you help me? Tie those strips
of bandage to the nuts.

220
00:41:43,697 --> 00:41:47,209
And I... will go for a walk.

221
00:41:49,494 --> 00:41:50,705
I need to do something...

222
00:42:04,176 --> 00:42:06,940
Don't go anywhere.

223
00:42:13,143 --> 00:42:14,484
Where's he going?

224
00:42:16,104 --> 00:42:18,156
He wants to be alone, I guess.

225
00:42:18,357 --> 00:42:22,912
Why? Even with the three of us
together, I feel weird.

226
00:42:25,322 --> 00:42:27,956
A date with the Zone.
He's a stalker.

227
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:31,630
And what does that mean?

228
00:42:32,788 --> 00:42:36,584
You see, being a stalker
is some sort of calling.

229
00:42:37,751 --> 00:42:41,097
- I thought he'd be different.
- Like what?

230
00:42:41,463 --> 00:42:45,770
Well, you know, the Leather Stockings,
Chingachgook sort of things...

231
00:42:46,343 --> 00:42:49,191
His background is even more frightful.

232
00:42:49,972 --> 00:42:53,068
Several times in prison,
then he was harmed here.

233
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:57,070
He has a mutant daughter,
“a victim of the Zone“ as they call it.

234
00:42:57,271 --> 00:42:58,564
They say she's got no legs.

235
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:05,660
And what about this Porcupine?

236
00:43:06,738 --> 00:43:09,159
What does it mean, “was punished“?

237
00:43:10,325 --> 00:43:11,915
Or was it just a figure of speech?

238
00:43:14,997 --> 00:43:19,754
One day Porcupine returned from here

239
00:43:21,086 --> 00:43:23,138
and got rich overnight.

240
00:43:25,174 --> 00:43:26,811
Fabulously rich.

241
00:43:27,009 --> 00:43:28,729
You call it punishment?

242
00:43:30,637 --> 00:43:32,892
A week later he hanged himself.

243
00:43:33,765 --> 00:43:34,774
Why?

244
00:43:35,601 --> 00:43:36,609
Quiet!

245
00:43:39,855 --> 00:43:41,658
What was that?

246
00:45:37,598 --> 00:45:42,189
Presumably a meteorite fell down
here about twenty years ago.

247
00:45:43,937 --> 00:45:45,740
It had burned down the settlement.

248
00:45:47,316 --> 00:45:51,196
They searched for this meteorite,
but never found it, of course.

249
00:45:52,988 --> 00:45:55,325
Why “of course“?

250
00:45:55,949 --> 00:45:58,251
Then people began disappearing here.

251
00:45:59,661 --> 00:46:01,916
They came here and never returned.

252
00:46:04,458 --> 00:46:06,261
So it was concluded...

253
00:46:07,419 --> 00:46:11,809
that this meteorite
was not really a meteorite.

254
00:46:12,966 --> 00:46:14,390
At first...

255
00:46:17,304 --> 00:46:22,559
they circled the place with barbed
wire to scare off the inquisitive.

256
00:46:25,812 --> 00:46:30,487
All this gave rise to rumours
that there's a place in the Zone...

257
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:35,660
where wishes come true.

258
00:46:36,532 --> 00:46:42,832
Naturally, they began to guard
the Zone like the apple of their eye.

259
00:46:44,957 --> 00:46:48,551
Who knows what kind of wish
someone might cherish.

260
00:46:49,294 --> 00:46:52,557
What was it if not a meteorite?

261
00:46:56,134 --> 00:46:57,688
I told you, no one knows.

262
00:46:59,388 --> 00:47:01,689
And what do you think?

263
00:47:03,642 --> 00:47:06,905
Nothing.
Or anything.

264
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:13,154
A message to mankind,
as one of my colleagues says.

265
00:47:13,986 --> 00:47:15,409
Ora gift.

266
00:47:20,576 --> 00:47:22,296
Some gift.

267
00:47:23,787 --> 00:47:25,757
Why on earth would they do it?

268
00:47:25,956 --> 00:47:27,676
To make us happy.

269
00:47:32,296 --> 00:47:36,353
The flowers are blooming again,
but they don't smell for some reason.

270
00:47:37,509 --> 00:47:42,515
Sorry for leaving you two here,
but it was too early to go anyway.

271
00:47:47,186 --> 00:47:48,194
Did you hear it?

272
00:47:49,688 --> 00:47:51,740
Maybe someone lives here?

273
00:47:53,233 --> 00:47:54,242
Who?

274
00:47:56,612 --> 00:47:58,866
You told me yourself

275
00:47:59,072 --> 00:48:03,794
about some tourists camped here
when the Zone originated.

276
00:48:04,703 --> 00:48:07,004
There's no one in the Zone and
there can't be.

277
00:48:12,252 --> 00:48:13,724
Well, it's time.

278
00:49:01,176 --> 00:49:02,813
How are we going to return?

279
00:49:03,887 --> 00:49:07,316
- They don't return here.
- What do you mean?

280
00:49:08,642 --> 00:49:10,777
We'll go as we agreed.

281
00:49:16,817 --> 00:49:18,869
I'll show the direction.

282
00:49:19,528 --> 00:49:21,580
Any deviation from it is dangerous.

283
00:49:24,283 --> 00:49:26,502
The first landmark is that last pole.

284
00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:30,835
You go first, Professor.

285
00:49:43,594 --> 00:49:44,602
Now you.

286
00:49:53,228 --> 00:49:55,280
Try to follow in his footsteps.

287
00:51:14,643 --> 00:51:17,324
Oh, my God! And where are...

288
00:51:18,021 --> 00:51:22,162
Did they remain here like that?
Those people?

289
00:51:22,734 --> 00:51:23,992
Who knows.

290
00:51:25,404 --> 00:51:30,754
I remember them packing at the station,
getting ready to come here.

291
00:51:31,577 --> 00:51:33,214
I was just a boy.

292
00:51:34,204 --> 00:51:38,166
We all thought then
that somebody wanted to conquer us.

293
00:51:45,132 --> 00:51:46,685
You first, Professor.

294
00:51:55,559 --> 00:51:56,567
Now you, Writer.

295
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:31,515
Your room is over there.
We'll go this way.

296
00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:37,190
Why were you hiking up the price?
It's so close at hand.

297
00:54:38,931 --> 00:54:41,944
Yes, but the hand
has to be very long.

298
00:54:43,894 --> 00:54:45,068
We don't have such a hand.

299
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:54,683
Don't! Leave it alone!

300
00:55:56,550 --> 00:55:58,685
Don't touch it!

301
00:56:01,763 --> 00:56:03,187
Don't touch it, I said!

302
00:56:04,183 --> 00:56:08,240
Are you crazy? What's the matter
with you?

303
00:56:10,814 --> 00:56:12,950
It's not the place for leisurely
strolls.

304
00:56:14,776 --> 00:56:17,197
The Zone wants to be respected.
Othenlvise it will punish.

305
00:56:17,404 --> 00:56:22,577
Don't you ever try it again...
Have you no tongue or what?

306
00:56:24,953 --> 00:56:26,045
I warned you, didn't I?

307
00:56:26,872 --> 00:56:27,880
Are we to go there?

308
00:56:30,584 --> 00:56:33,597
Yes. Up, enter it and to the left.

309
00:56:33,795 --> 00:56:38,552
Only we are not going this way.
We'll go around.

310
00:56:39,968 --> 00:56:41,179
Why?

311
00:56:42,846 --> 00:56:43,938
People don't go this way.

312
00:56:44,598 --> 00:56:48,441
In the Zone, the longer way,
the less risk.

313
00:56:49,645 --> 00:56:51,614
And to go straight ahead is fatal?

314
00:56:51,813 --> 00:56:53,404
He told you it's dangerous.

315
00:56:53,607 --> 00:56:57,238
- And making a detour's not dangerous?
- It is. But they don't go this way.

316
00:56:57,444 --> 00:57:00,541
What do I care that they don't?
What if I take a chance...

317
00:57:00,739 --> 00:57:02,293
Listen, what's the matter with you...

318
00:57:02,491 --> 00:57:05,837
To go all the way around!
When everything's so close.

319
00:57:06,411 --> 00:57:09,674
Here a risk, there a risk.
What the hell!

320
00:57:09,873 --> 00:57:13,136
You're being very flippant
about this.

321
00:57:15,337 --> 00:57:17,841
I'm fed up with all those nuts
and bandages.

322
00:57:18,632 --> 00:57:21,847
You may do as you wish,
but I'm going.

323
00:57:22,553 --> 00:57:25,138
- You're insane.
- It's you who are...

324
00:57:26,139 --> 00:57:27,563
May I?

325
00:57:39,695 --> 00:57:41,201
The wind is coming up...

326
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,826
Can you feel it? The grass...

327
00:57:54,626 --> 00:57:58,055
All the more so.

328
00:57:58,881 --> 00:58:00,304
What do you mean?

329
00:58:17,024 --> 00:58:18,032
Wait!

330
00:58:18,275 --> 00:58:19,616
Keep your hands off!

331
00:58:20,777 --> 00:58:27,539
Professor be my witness,
I didn't sent you there.

332
00:58:27,743 --> 00:58:29,878
You go of your own will.

333
00:58:30,078 --> 00:58:32,130
Of my own will. What else?

334
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:35,591
Nothing. Go.

335
00:58:42,591 --> 00:58:44,394
God help you to be lucky.

336
00:58:59,775 --> 00:59:00,902
Listen!

337
00:59:01,777 --> 00:59:04,197
Should you notice something,

338
00:59:04,738 --> 00:59:07,835
or just feel something,

339
00:59:08,033 --> 00:59:10,619
go back at once, or...

340
00:59:10,827 --> 00:59:13,675
Just don't throw iron poles at me.

341
01:00:23,025 --> 01:00:24,413
Stop! Don't move!

342
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:32,670
- Why did you do it?
- Why did I do what?

343
01:00:33,118 --> 01:00:38,208
- Why did you stop him?
- I thought it was you...

344
01:01:18,205 --> 01:01:22,262
What's up?
Why did you stop me?

345
01:01:23,168 --> 01:01:24,509
I didn't stop you.

346
01:01:24,711 --> 01:01:26,966
Who did it then? You?

347
01:01:31,426 --> 01:01:33,063
Who the hell knows...

348
01:01:35,597 --> 01:01:38,231
You're smart, Mister Shakespeare.

349
01:01:38,725 --> 01:01:41,193
To go straight ahead is scary,
to go back is embarrassing.

350
01:01:41,854 --> 01:01:47,204
So you gave yourself a command.
Fear has made you come to your senses.

351
01:01:48,026 --> 01:01:49,616
- What?
- Stop it.

352
01:01:50,195 --> 01:01:53,374
- Why have you emptied the bottle?
- Stop it, I said!

353
01:02:09,548 --> 01:02:13,807
The Zone is a very complicated system...

354
01:02:16,847 --> 01:02:20,394
of traps,
and they're all deadly.

355
01:02:23,478 --> 01:02:26,196
I don't know what's going on here
in the absence of people,

356
01:02:27,107 --> 01:02:32,362
but the moment someone shows up,
everything comes into motion.

357
01:02:35,032 --> 01:02:37,666
Old traps disappear
and new ones emerge.

358
01:02:39,536 --> 01:02:42,122
Safe spots
become impassable.

359
01:02:43,874 --> 01:02:48,798
Now your path is easy,
now it's hopelessly involved.

360
01:02:53,467 --> 01:02:54,808
That's the Zone.

361
01:02:56,470 --> 01:02:59,768
It may even seem capricious.

362
01:03:01,433 --> 01:03:05,230
But it is what we've made it
with our condition.

363
01:03:08,482 --> 01:03:13,737
It happened that people had
to stop halfway and go back.

364
01:03:15,447 --> 01:03:18,626
Some of them even died
on the very threshold of the room.

365
01:03:20,118 --> 01:03:23,048
But everything that's going on here
depends not on the Zone, but on us!

366
01:03:23,705 --> 01:03:27,134
So it lets the good ones pass
and kills the bad ones?

367
01:03:28,544 --> 01:03:30,264
I don't know.

368
01:03:30,462 --> 01:03:32,847
I think
it lets those pass who...

369
01:03:33,841 --> 01:03:35,893
have lost all hope.

370
01:03:36,385 --> 01:03:40,347
Not good or bad,
but wretched people.

371
01:03:41,849 --> 01:03:45,728
But even the most wretched will die
if they don't know how to behave.

372
01:03:55,904 --> 01:03:59,286
You have been lucky,
it just warned you.

373
01:04:03,996 --> 01:04:06,676
I guess I'll wait for you here

374
01:04:07,833 --> 01:04:12,839
until you come back,
made happy.

375
01:04:13,839 --> 01:04:15,262
It's impossible!

376
01:04:15,465 --> 01:04:18,562
I've got sandwiches, a thermos...

377
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:21,264
You won't last even an hour here
without me.

378
01:04:21,805 --> 01:04:24,902
Besides, one doesn't return here
the way one comes.

379
01:04:27,394 --> 01:04:29,364
Anyway, I would prefer...

380
01:04:29,563 --> 01:04:31,864
Then we're going back right away.

381
01:04:32,691 --> 01:04:36,653
I'll return your money
minus a certain sum

382
01:04:37,362 --> 01:04:38,834
for the trouble, so to speak...

383
01:04:39,907 --> 01:04:41,828
Have you come to your senses,
Professor?

384
01:04:47,206 --> 01:04:50,005
All right. Go on, throw your nut.

385
01:05:41,219 --> 01:05:44,896
Part Two

386
01:05:47,058 --> 01:05:53,073
STALKER

387
01:05:55,984 --> 01:05:58,997
Where are you?
Come here!

388
01:06:04,325 --> 01:06:05,879
Are you tired?

389
01:06:21,634 --> 01:06:23,437
Oh, God!

390
01:06:26,931 --> 01:06:31,487
Judging by his tone, he's going to
start sermonizing again.

391
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:53,714
Let everything that's been planned
come true.

392
01:06:55,168 --> 01:06:57,054
Let them believe.

393
01:06:59,088 --> 01:07:01,971
And let them have a laugh
at their passions.

394
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:06,941
Because what they call passion
actually is not some emotional energy,

395
01:07:07,305 --> 01:07:10,567
but just the friction between
their souls and the outside world.

396
01:07:12,018 --> 01:07:15,031
And most important,
let them believe in themselves

397
01:07:16,189 --> 01:07:19,286
let them be helpless like children,

398
01:07:20,026 --> 01:07:23,869
because weakness is a great thing,
and strength is nothing.

399
01:07:28,785 --> 01:07:31,882
When a man is just born,
he is weak and flexible,

400
01:07:32,705 --> 01:07:35,423
when he dies,
he is hard and insensitive.

401
01:07:37,043 --> 01:07:40,056
When a tree is growing,
it's tender and pliant,

402
01:07:40,421 --> 01:07:44,644
but when it's dry and hard,
it dies.

403
01:07:46,010 --> 01:07:50,067
Hardness and strength
are death's companions.

404
01:07:51,891 --> 01:07:55,438
Pliancy and weakness are
expressions of the freshness of being.

405
01:07:57,188 --> 01:08:01,494
Because what has hardened
will never win.

406
01:08:21,713 --> 01:08:26,802
Come here!
We're progressing well.

407
01:08:27,093 --> 01:08:29,679
Soon we'll come to a dry tunnel,
after that it will get easier.

408
01:08:29,971 --> 01:08:31,774
Knock on wood.

409
01:08:32,056 --> 01:08:36,778
- Are we on our way already?
- Of course. Why?

410
01:08:36,978 --> 01:08:41,652
I thought you just wanted
to show us something.

411
01:08:42,108 --> 01:08:45,323
- What about my knapsack?
- What about it?

412
01:08:45,528 --> 01:08:49,490
I left it there.
I didn't know we were going.

413
01:08:50,199 --> 01:08:54,506
- There's nothing we can do about it.
- No, we have to go back.

414
01:08:54,746 --> 01:08:57,380
- It's impossible!
- I can't do without my knapsack!

415
01:08:57,582 --> 01:09:01,805
Can't you understand that no one here
has ever come back the same way?

416
01:09:03,838 --> 01:09:07,385
Forget about your knapsack.
What have you got there, diamonds?

417
01:09:07,675 --> 01:09:11,104
The room will give you
anything you want.

418
01:09:11,304 --> 01:09:15,266
Really. It will drown you
in knapsacks.

419
01:09:15,475 --> 01:09:17,729
How far is it, this room?

420
01:09:18,019 --> 01:09:22,859
If you go straight, about 200 meters,
but there's no going straight here.

421
01:09:23,107 --> 01:09:24,318
Let's go.

422
01:09:25,902 --> 01:09:31,371
Give up your empiricism, Professor.
Miracles are outside empiricism.

423
01:09:33,660 --> 01:09:36,590
Remember how St. Peter
was nearly drowned?

424
01:09:41,209 --> 01:09:42,680
Go, Writer.

425
01:09:44,879 --> 01:09:46,220
Go where?

426
01:09:46,965 --> 01:09:48,720
Up these stairs.

427
01:09:59,185 --> 01:10:01,237
Professor, where are you?

428
01:11:52,590 --> 01:11:54,642
Here is the dry tunnel!

429
01:11:54,926 --> 01:11:56,978
You call it dry?

430
01:11:58,429 --> 01:12:03,435
This is a local joke.
Normally one has to swim here.

431
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:34,717
Wait, where's Professor?

432
01:12:34,924 --> 01:12:38,103
- What?
- Professor has disappeared!

433
01:12:38,303 --> 01:12:42,609
How could it happen?
He was following you all the way.

434
01:12:43,516 --> 01:12:46,862
He probably lagged behind and
lost his way.

435
01:12:47,061 --> 01:12:50,692
No, he didn't lose his way!
He must've gone for the knapsack!

436
01:12:51,149 --> 01:12:52,952
He won't be able to make it now.

437
01:12:54,444 --> 01:12:55,737
Shall we wait for him?

438
01:12:55,945 --> 01:13:00,999
We can't. Things change here
every minute. We'll have to go.

439
01:13:30,688 --> 01:13:33,369
Look! What is it? How could it be?

440
01:13:33,566 --> 01:13:37,160
- I already explained.
- What did you explain?

441
01:13:37,362 --> 01:13:42,914
It's the Zone, don't you understand?
Let's go, quick. It's...

442
01:14:03,805 --> 01:14:05,146
There he is!

443
01:14:18,653 --> 01:14:22,533
I'm certainly grateful to you
that you... but...

444
01:14:22,824 --> 01:14:24,377
How did you get here?

445
01:14:26,828 --> 01:14:32,712
Mostly I had to crawl up here
on my fours.

446
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:36,724
Incredible.
How did you manage to overtake us?

447
01:14:38,131 --> 01:14:44,098
What do you mean, “overtake“?
I came back here for the knapsack.

448
01:14:46,139 --> 01:14:48,523
And how has our nut gotten here?

449
01:14:51,144 --> 01:14:55,735
Oh, my God, that's...
the trap!

450
01:14:59,861 --> 01:15:03,918
Porcupine put this nut here
on purpose.

451
01:15:07,243 --> 01:15:11,550
How could the Zone let us through?

452
01:15:17,670 --> 01:15:22,925
Oh God, I'm not going
to take one more step until...

453
01:15:24,093 --> 01:15:25,683
I don't like it.

454
01:15:31,142 --> 01:15:34,903
That's it! We rest!

455
01:15:47,909 --> 01:15:52,215
But keep off this nut,
just in case.

456
01:15:53,289 --> 01:15:57,512
Sorry, but I thought that
Professor won't be able to make it.

457
01:15:58,086 --> 01:15:59,094
You see, I...

458
01:16:01,005 --> 01:16:04,718
I never know beforehand what kind
of people I'm taking with me.

459
01:16:05,259 --> 01:16:09,685
Everything gets clear only here,
when it's too late.

460
01:16:10,765 --> 01:16:16,282
What's important is that Professor's
bag with his underwear is safe.

461
01:16:17,355 --> 01:16:22,361
Don't stick your nose in someone's
underwear if you don't understand it.

462
01:16:22,735 --> 01:16:27,659
What is there to understand?
Binomial theorem?

463
01:16:29,158 --> 01:16:31,923
Some psychological abysses!

464
01:16:32,286 --> 01:16:34,790
You have a bad reputation
at your institute.

465
01:16:34,998 --> 01:16:37,631
They don't give you money
for an expedition.

466
01:16:38,459 --> 01:16:43,050
So you decide to pack a knapsack
full of manometers and other shit...

467
01:16:44,799 --> 01:16:46,970
penetrate the Zone illegally...

468
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:51,188
and put all these miracles
to an algebra test.

469
01:16:53,933 --> 01:16:57,030
No one in the world
has ever heard of the Zone.

470
01:16:57,395 --> 01:16:59,566
So we'll work a sure sensation!

471
01:17:00,732 --> 01:17:06,249
The television, fans raving
and bringing laurel wreaths.

472
01:17:07,155 --> 01:17:11,710
Here our Professor appears,
all in white,

473
01:17:12,285 --> 01:17:16,710
and declares:
“Mene-mene, tekel, uprasin.“

474
01:17:17,915 --> 01:17:20,419
Everyone gaping

475
01:17:20,627 --> 01:17:24,933
and shouting:
“He deserves a Nobel Prize!“

476
01:17:27,759 --> 01:17:33,228
You lousy scribbler,
a homespun psychoanalyst.

477
01:17:34,182 --> 01:17:40,030
You're only good for painting walls
in public toilets, you blabbermouth.

478
01:17:41,314 --> 01:17:45,075
No good. Too sluggish.

479
01:17:46,861 --> 01:17:49,162
You don't know how to do it.

480
01:17:49,822 --> 01:17:52,752
All right. I'm going to get
a Nobel Prize.

481
01:17:53,701 --> 01:17:58,127
And what are you after?
Want to bless mankind

482
01:17:58,331 --> 01:18:01,843
with the pearls
of your purchased inspiration?

483
01:18:03,294 --> 01:18:07,256
I don't care a damn about mankind.
Of all your mankind

484
01:18:07,465 --> 01:18:12,353
I'm interested
only in one man - myself.

485
01:18:13,096 --> 01:18:17,568
Whether I'm worth anything
or I'm just shit like others.

486
01:18:19,018 --> 01:18:22,612
And if you find out
that you're really...

487
01:18:22,814 --> 01:18:27,737
You know, Mr. Einstein,
I have no wish to argue with you.

488
01:18:30,905 --> 01:18:34,962
Truth is born of argument,
damn it!

489
01:18:38,121 --> 01:18:40,968
Listen, Chingachgook...

490
01:18:44,544 --> 01:18:48,424
You've brought here
many people.

491
01:18:50,425 --> 01:18:52,928
Not as many as I would like.

492
01:18:53,219 --> 01:18:59,103
That's not the point. Why did they
come here? What did they want?

493
01:18:59,392 --> 01:19:01,278
Happiness, I guess.

494
01:19:01,477 --> 01:19:05,321
Yes, but what kind of happiness?

495
01:19:08,109 --> 01:19:10,659
People don't like to speak about
their innermost feelings.

496
01:19:12,447 --> 01:19:15,211
And it's neither yours
nor mine business.

497
01:19:16,534 --> 01:19:18,835
In any case, you've been lucky.

498
01:19:19,329 --> 01:19:23,172
As for me, I haven't seen
one happy man in my life.

499
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:25,173
Me neither.

500
01:19:26,002 --> 01:19:28,932
They return from the room
and I lead them back,

501
01:19:29,631 --> 01:19:31,885
and we never see each other again.

502
01:19:34,093 --> 01:19:36,976
It's not that wishes come true
immediately.

503
01:19:38,264 --> 01:19:44,481
Have you ever wished
to use this room yourself?

504
01:19:49,275 --> 01:19:51,245
I'm fine as I am.

505
01:20:43,746 --> 01:20:46,083
Listen, Professor.

506
01:20:48,293 --> 01:20:51,591
Speaking of the purchased inspiration.

507
01:20:54,090 --> 01:20:56,771
Let's imagine that I enter this room

508
01:20:56,968 --> 01:21:01,358
and return to our God-forsaken
town a genius.

509
01:21:08,187 --> 01:21:12,944
A man writes because he's tormented,
because he doubts.

510
01:21:15,236 --> 01:21:19,293
He needs to constantly prove
to himself and the others

511
01:21:19,490 --> 01:21:21,246
that he's worth something.

512
01:21:23,953 --> 01:21:26,919
And if I know for sure
that I'm a genius?

513
01:21:29,459 --> 01:21:31,428
Why write then?

514
01:21:33,921 --> 01:21:35,512
What the hell for?

515
01:21:38,384 --> 01:21:41,599
Well, I must say

516
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:44,569
that we exist for...

517
01:21:44,766 --> 01:21:48,028
Will you be so kind
and leave me alone?

518
01:21:49,979 --> 01:21:54,120
Let me get a wink,
I haven't slept all night.

519
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:57,661
Keep your complexes to yourself.

520
01:21:58,571 --> 01:22:03,661
In any case,
all this technology of yours...

521
01:22:07,121 --> 01:22:09,589
all those blast furnaces, wheels...

522
01:22:11,709 --> 01:22:15,766
and other bullshit

523
01:22:16,005 --> 01:22:19,517
are only designed in order
to work less and eat more.

524
01:22:21,260 --> 01:22:24,025
They are all just crutches,
artificial limbs.

525
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:30,777
And mankind exists
in order to create...

526
01:22:33,356 --> 01:22:35,575
works of art.

527
01:22:37,568 --> 01:22:42,788
Unlike all other human activities,
this one is unselfish.

528
01:22:45,159 --> 01:22:50,249
Great illusions!
Images of the absolute truth!

529
01:22:52,208 --> 01:22:54,676
Are you listening to me, Professor?

530
01:22:56,546 --> 01:22:59,096
What unselfishness are you talking
about?

531
01:22:59,757 --> 01:23:03,720
People still die of hunger.
Have you fallen from the moon?

532
01:23:13,563 --> 01:23:16,742
And they are considered to be
our brainy aristocracy!

533
01:23:18,776 --> 01:23:21,790
You're not even capable of thinking
in abstractions.

534
01:23:23,489 --> 01:23:29,172
Are you going to teach me
about the meaning of life?

535
01:23:32,665 --> 01:23:34,717
And also how to think?

536
01:23:35,835 --> 01:23:41,886
It's useless. You might be
a professor, but an ignorant one.

537
01:24:31,933 --> 01:24:36,275
And there was
a great earthquake.

538
01:24:37,772 --> 01:24:41,035
And the sun became black
as sackcloth made of hair.

539
01:24:42,110 --> 01:24:44,329
And the moon became like blood...

540
01:24:46,531 --> 01:24:49,829
And the stars of the sky
fell to the earth,

541
01:24:50,368 --> 01:24:54,330
as a fig tree casts
its unripe figs

542
01:24:54,539 --> 01:24:57,967
when shaken by a great wind.

543
01:24:59,043 --> 01:25:02,507
And the sky was split apart
like a scroll when it is rolled up.

544
01:25:03,214 --> 01:25:09,810
And every mountain and island
were moved out of their places.

545
01:25:13,933 --> 01:25:18,572
And the kings of the earth and
the great men

546
01:25:19,647 --> 01:25:23,609
and the rich and the chiliarchs

547
01:25:23,901 --> 01:25:29,074
and the strong and every free man,

548
01:25:29,907 --> 01:25:33,621
hid themselves in the caves
and among the rocks of the mountains;

549
01:25:33,911 --> 01:25:38,052
and they said to the mountains and
to the rocks, “Fall on us

550
01:25:38,333 --> 01:25:42,129
and hide us from the presence of
Him who sits on the throne,

551
01:25:42,837 --> 01:25:45,091
and from the wrath of the Lamb,

552
01:25:45,882 --> 01:25:49,144
for the great day of His wrath
has come,

553
01:25:50,219 --> 01:25:53,767
and who is able to stand?“

554
01:28:55,321 --> 01:28:57,291
And that very day two...

555
01:28:59,075 --> 01:29:00,498
two of them...

556
01:29:02,787 --> 01:29:06,749
were going to a village
which was about 60 stadia from...

557
01:29:07,834 --> 01:29:09,175
named...

558
01:29:10,545 --> 01:29:13,807
and they were conversing with each
other about all these things.

559
01:29:14,507 --> 01:29:17,520
And while they were conversing
and discussing...

560
01:29:17,719 --> 01:29:21,681
He Himself approached,
and began travelling with them.

561
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:26,572
But their eyes were prevented
from recognizing Him.

562
01:29:28,062 --> 01:29:30,114
And He said to them:
“What are these words...

563
01:29:32,859 --> 01:29:36,453
you are exchanging with one another,
and why are you sad?“

564
01:29:37,196 --> 01:29:38,750
And one of them, named...

565
01:29:53,296 --> 01:29:54,470
Are you awake?

566
01:30:00,928 --> 01:30:03,064
You were speaking of the meaning...

567
01:30:04,641 --> 01:30:06,977
of our... life...

568
01:30:08,144 --> 01:30:10,114
of the unselfishness of art...

569
01:30:13,941 --> 01:30:15,911
Take music, for instance.

570
01:30:22,283 --> 01:30:25,213
Less than anything else,
it is connected to reality,

571
01:30:26,037 --> 01:30:29,917
or if connected at all, it's done
mechanically, not by way of ideas,

572
01:30:30,124 --> 01:30:33,921
just by a sheer sound, devoid of...
any associations.

573
01:30:39,133 --> 01:30:44,686
And yet, music, as if by some miracle,
gets through to our heart.

574
01:30:48,351 --> 01:30:52,313
What is it that resonates in us in
response to noise brought to harmony,

575
01:30:53,314 --> 01:30:57,455
making it the source
of the greatest delight

576
01:30:57,652 --> 01:31:00,333
which stuns us and brings us
together?

577
01:31:02,073 --> 01:31:06,130
What's all this needed for?
And most important, who needs it?

578
01:31:09,372 --> 01:31:13,168
You would say,
“No one. And for no reason.“

579
01:31:13,543 --> 01:31:14,753
Unselfishly.

580
01:31:16,587 --> 01:31:17,798
No.

581
01:31:19,716 --> 01:31:20,807
I don't think so.

582
01:31:23,386 --> 01:31:26,483
After all,
everything has some sense.

583
01:31:28,349 --> 01:31:31,943
Sense and reason.

584
01:32:01,257 --> 01:32:04,639
Do we have to go there?

585
01:32:07,263 --> 01:32:11,320
Unfortunately, yes.
There's no other way.

586
01:32:27,241 --> 01:32:31,299
It looks morbid, don't you think,
Professor?

587
01:32:35,583 --> 01:32:38,264
I don't feel like going there first.

588
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:42,185
And Chingachgooks
can never be volunteers.

589
01:32:44,175 --> 01:32:48,684
I think we'll have to draw lots.
Do you mind?

590
01:32:49,514 --> 01:32:52,611
For this, I would rather have
a volunteer.

591
01:32:55,311 --> 01:32:56,782
Have you got matches?

592
01:33:05,279 --> 01:33:06,288
Thanks.

593
01:33:18,876 --> 01:33:20,383
The long one will go.

594
01:33:23,923 --> 01:33:24,931
Pull it.

595
01:33:32,265 --> 01:33:35,777
The long one.
No luck this time.

596
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:53,751
Why don't you throw one of your nuts
at least?

597
01:33:54,495 --> 01:33:56,216
Sure. As you wish.

598
01:34:34,118 --> 01:34:35,127
One more?

599
01:34:44,545 --> 01:34:48,342
All right... I'll go.

600
01:36:35,782 --> 01:36:37,205
Hurry up, Professor!

601
01:40:47,742 --> 01:40:54,671
There's... There's a door here!

602
01:41:12,308 --> 01:41:16,733
Go that way!
Open the door and go in!

603
01:41:25,363 --> 01:41:28,661
Me again?
Do I have to go in first again?

604
01:41:29,450 --> 01:41:34,706
You've drawn the lot.
Go! People don't wait here.

605
01:41:39,627 --> 01:41:43,589
What have you got there?
No guns here!

606
01:41:44,590 --> 01:41:46,892
You'll have yourself killed,
and us too!

607
01:41:47,427 --> 01:41:48,980
Don't you remember the tanks?

608
01:41:50,221 --> 01:41:51,942
Drop it, I beg you.

609
01:41:52,140 --> 01:41:54,192
Don't you understand?

610
01:41:55,685 --> 01:41:59,825
If something happens,
I can save you, but not this way...

611
01:42:01,441 --> 01:42:08,072
I beg you!
Who are you going to fire at?

612
01:42:21,502 --> 01:42:23,804
Go, we haven't got much time!

613
01:42:28,092 --> 01:42:29,385
There's water here!

614
01:42:30,720 --> 01:42:33,401
Hold on to the handrail and go down.

615
01:43:19,978 --> 01:43:23,857
But don't go anywhere!
Wait for us outside!

616
01:43:38,579 --> 01:43:40,632
I hope you haven't got anything
like that?

617
01:43:41,624 --> 01:43:44,305
- Like what?
- Like a gun.

618
01:43:44,752 --> 01:43:47,600
No. As a last resort
I've got an ampule.

619
01:43:48,589 --> 01:43:52,896
- What ampule?
- Implanted ampule. Poison!

620
01:43:53,219 --> 01:43:56,316
Oh, God! Did you come here to die?

621
01:44:02,603 --> 01:44:05,237
No, it's just in case.

622
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:34,603
Writer! Come back!

623
01:44:34,969 --> 01:44:37,354
Come back! You want to get yourself
killed?

624
01:44:37,555 --> 01:44:42,146
I told you to wait by the exit!
Stop! Don't move!

625
01:45:28,564 --> 01:45:30,201
That's all your pipe.

626
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:34,457
- Why?
- You should've gone in there first.

627
01:45:35,697 --> 01:45:38,710
He was so scared that he went
the wrong way.

628
01:47:24,931 --> 01:47:27,861
One more experiment.

629
01:47:30,687 --> 01:47:35,942
Experiments, facts,
truth of the highest instance.

630
01:47:37,860 --> 01:47:41,158
There's no such thing as facts.
Especially here.

631
01:47:42,824 --> 01:47:47,498
All this is someone's
idiotic invention.

632
01:47:47,704 --> 01:47:49,756
Don't you feel it?

633
01:47:52,291 --> 01:47:55,388
But you, of course, must find out
whose invention it is.

634
01:47:57,797 --> 01:47:59,387
And why.

635
01:48:00,717 --> 01:48:02,971
What good can your knowledge do?

636
01:48:03,261 --> 01:48:07,401
Who is going to get guilty conscience
because of it? Me?

637
01:48:08,558 --> 01:48:12,070
I've got no conscience.
I just got nerves.

638
01:48:12,895 --> 01:48:15,825
Some bastard would criticize me,
I get wounded.

639
01:48:16,733 --> 01:48:19,450
Another would loud me,
I get wounded again.

640
01:48:20,194 --> 01:48:25,200
I would put my heart and soul in it,
they gobble up both my heart and soul.

641
01:48:27,410 --> 01:48:30,507
I would relieve my soul of filth,
they gobble it up too.

642
01:48:31,664 --> 01:48:34,132
They're all so literate.

643
01:48:36,085 --> 01:48:38,933
They all got sensory deficiency.

644
01:48:40,089 --> 01:48:44,515
And they're all swarming around,
journalists,

645
01:48:44,719 --> 01:48:49,773
editors, critics,
some endless broads.

646
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:53,530
And they all demand:
more, more!

647
01:48:57,023 --> 01:49:02,575
What hell of a writer am I
if I hate writing?

648
01:49:04,697 --> 01:49:08,754
If it's constant torment for me,
a painful, shameful occupation,

649
01:49:08,951 --> 01:49:11,336
sort of squeezing out a hemorrhoids.

650
01:49:14,832 --> 01:49:18,380
I used to think that someone would
get better because of my books.

651
01:49:18,836 --> 01:49:20,557
No, nobody needs me!

652
01:49:21,464 --> 01:49:25,936
In two days after I die they'll start
gobbling up someone else.

653
01:49:29,472 --> 01:49:33,399
I wanted to change them,
but it's they who've changed me.

654
01:49:33,893 --> 01:49:36,444
Making me in their own image.

655
01:49:41,609 --> 01:49:46,200
The future used to be just
a continuation of the present,

656
01:49:46,489 --> 01:49:50,167
with all the changes looming far
behind the horizon.

657
01:49:51,077 --> 01:49:54,007
Now the future and the present
are one.

658
01:50:01,671 --> 01:50:03,925
Are they ready for it?

659
01:50:04,799 --> 01:50:09,058
They don't want to know anything!
All they know is how to gobble!

660
01:50:23,693 --> 01:50:25,283
Gosh, how lucky you are!

661
01:50:26,446 --> 01:50:31,202
My goodness, now...
You're going to live a hundred years!

662
01:50:45,298 --> 01:50:49,260
Yes. But why not forever?

663
01:50:52,513 --> 01:50:54,067
Like the eternal Jew.

664
01:51:34,681 --> 01:51:38,442
You are probably a fine man.

665
01:51:38,643 --> 01:51:40,446
I almost didn't doubt it.

666
01:51:41,187 --> 01:51:45,067
I can imagine what torture it was
for you being in there.

667
01:51:46,484 --> 01:51:49,830
This pipe is a horrible place!
The most horrible in the Zone!

668
01:51:50,029 --> 01:51:52,959
It's called “the meat mincer“,
but it's much worse than any mincer.

669
01:51:53,366 --> 01:51:55,205
So many people perished there!

670
01:52:00,373 --> 01:52:03,671
Porcupine sent his brother
to die there.

671
01:52:07,171 --> 01:52:09,307
The boy was so delicate,
very talented.

672
01:52:12,010 --> 01:52:13,397
Here, listen to this.

673
01:52:15,430 --> 01:52:19,570
So summer is gone,
Leaving no epitaph.

674
01:52:20,727 --> 01:52:24,867
It's still warm in the sun,
Only that's not enough.

675
01:52:25,940 --> 01:52:27,992
All that true could have come,

676
01:52:28,693 --> 01:52:32,952
Like a five-fingered fluff,
Folded into my palm,

677
01:52:34,032 --> 01:52:36,084
Only that's not enough.

678
01:52:37,160 --> 01:52:41,466
No evil was slighted
In the good aftermath,

679
01:52:42,457 --> 01:52:46,846
World was festively lighted,
Only that's not enough.

680
01:52:47,837 --> 01:52:52,393
Life forever was tucking,
Caring, making me laugh.

681
01:52:53,217 --> 01:52:57,440
I was really lucky,
Only that's not enough.

682
01:52:58,598 --> 01:53:03,106
No leaves ever seared,
No limbs broken rough.

683
01:53:04,062 --> 01:53:09,068
Day, like glass, washed all clear,
Only that's not enough.

684
01:53:11,277 --> 01:53:13,958
Good, aren't they?
That's his verses.

685
01:53:14,155 --> 01:53:17,749
Why do you fidget?
Fussing all the time?

686
01:53:18,326 --> 01:53:20,378
- I'm just...
- I get sick just looking at you!

687
01:53:20,578 --> 01:53:25,584
I'm so happy! It's not often that
everyone who goes makes it.

688
01:53:25,792 --> 01:53:29,849
You did everything right.
You're good, kind, honest people.

689
01:53:30,046 --> 01:53:31,434
I'm proud that I was right about you.

690
01:53:31,631 --> 01:53:34,977
Look at him! He's happy
that everything ended well!

691
01:53:35,802 --> 01:53:39,859
Fate! Zone!
I'm a fine man, he says!

692
01:53:40,223 --> 01:53:42,987
You think I didn't see how you
shoved the two long matches at me?

693
01:53:43,184 --> 01:53:45,770
- No, you don't understand...
- Of course, how could I?

694
01:53:45,979 --> 01:53:49,941
I'm sorry, Professor,
no offense meant,

695
01:53:50,149 --> 01:53:52,201
but this jerk has chosen you
to be his favorite.

696
01:53:52,402 --> 01:53:53,659
Come on, it's unfair!

697
01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:57,666
And me, a second-rate creature,
he shoves into that pipe!

698
01:53:58,658 --> 01:54:00,959
Meat mincer! To think of such
a word!

699
01:54:02,203 --> 01:54:04,339
What right have you got to decide

700
01:54:04,539 --> 01:54:07,042
who is to live and
who is to go into the meat mincer?

701
01:54:07,250 --> 01:54:09,302
You've chosen it yourself!

702
01:54:09,502 --> 01:54:13,725
What? One long match out of the two
long ones?

703
01:54:14,382 --> 01:54:16,138
The matches are nothing.

704
01:54:16,467 --> 01:54:19,433
The Zone had let you through
earlier, under the nut,

705
01:54:19,637 --> 01:54:23,647
so it became clear that only you
could go through the meat mincer.

706
01:54:24,267 --> 01:54:25,275
And we just followed you.

707
01:54:25,476 --> 01:54:26,485
Well, it's too much...

708
01:54:27,645 --> 01:54:32,320
You can't even imagine how dangerous
it is to make a mistake here.

709
01:54:33,401 --> 01:54:35,453
But someone had to be first!

710
01:54:36,029 --> 01:54:39,375
Yes? No, it's not a clinic!

711
01:54:41,242 --> 01:54:45,003
You see, someone has to go first!

712
01:54:52,003 --> 01:54:53,011
Don't touch it!

713
01:55:14,942 --> 01:55:17,161
Laboratory nine, please.

714
01:55:18,488 --> 01:55:19,876
<i>Just a minute.</i>

715
01:55:26,496 --> 01:55:29,177
- Hello?
- I hope I'm not disturbing you.

716
01:55:29,791 --> 01:55:33,753
- What do you want?
- Just a few words with you.

717
01:55:34,128 --> 01:55:36,714
You've hidden it. I've found it.

718
01:55:36,923 --> 01:55:42,522
The old building. Bunker four.
Do you hear me?

719
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:45,140
I'm alerting the security
immediately.

720
01:55:45,348 --> 01:55:50,698
You may do it.
You may inform on me,

721
01:55:50,895 --> 01:55:55,036
you may set my colleagues against me,
but it's too late.

722
01:55:55,274 --> 01:56:00,874
I'm now at a stone's throw
from that place.

723
01:56:01,698 --> 01:56:04,331
Do you realize that's the end of you
as a scientist?

724
01:56:04,534 --> 01:56:05,625
Well, you may rejoice!

725
01:56:05,868 --> 01:56:09,048
Do you realize what will happen
if you dare?

726
01:56:11,332 --> 01:56:12,673
Trying to scare me again?

727
01:56:15,086 --> 01:56:20,436
All my life I've been afraid of
something. Even of you.

728
01:56:21,217 --> 01:56:24,147
But now I'm not afraid of anything,
I assure you.

729
01:56:24,804 --> 01:56:27,734
Oh God, you are not even
a Herostratos.

730
01:56:28,433 --> 01:56:31,363
It's just that you've always wanted
to make my life unbearable

731
01:56:31,561 --> 01:56:34,242
because twenty years ago
I slept with your wife.

732
01:56:35,398 --> 01:56:39,194
And now you're delighted
that you've made even with me.

733
01:56:39,652 --> 01:56:43,959
Well, go and do your...
vile thing.

734
01:56:45,033 --> 01:56:46,835
Don't you dare hang up on me!

735
01:56:48,619 --> 01:56:51,633
Prison is not the worst thing
expecting you.

736
01:56:52,165 --> 01:56:55,095
The worst is that you'll never be
able to forgive yourself for this.

737
01:56:55,293 --> 01:56:59,765
I already see you hanging from your
suspenders in your prison cell.

738
01:57:02,925 --> 01:57:06,473
What are you up to, Professor?

739
01:57:07,722 --> 01:57:12,479
Do you realize what will happen
when everybody believes in the room?

740
01:57:14,228 --> 01:57:17,158
And all come rushing here?

741
01:57:18,149 --> 01:57:22,029
It's only a question of time.

742
01:57:22,320 --> 01:57:25,701
If not today, then tomorrow!
And not just tens of them, thousands!

743
01:57:25,907 --> 01:57:30,712
Unfulfilled emperors,
great inquisitors, fuhrers,

744
01:57:31,079 --> 01:57:34,709
self-appointed benefactors
of the human race!

745
01:57:35,375 --> 01:57:39,883
And they'll come not for money or
inspiration, but to change the world!

746
01:57:40,088 --> 01:57:41,927
I never take here people like that.
You think I don't understand it?

747
01:57:42,131 --> 01:57:44,896
What on earth can you understand?

748
01:57:45,885 --> 01:57:48,104
You're not the only stalker
on Earth.

749
01:57:48,721 --> 01:57:50,691
No stalker can know

750
01:57:50,890 --> 01:57:54,687
what those you lead bring with them
and what they take from here.

751
01:57:55,353 --> 01:57:58,201
And the number of unmotivated
crimes is on the rise!

752
01:57:58,398 --> 01:57:59,988
Isn't that your doing?

753
01:58:00,191 --> 01:58:05,281
Take coups d'etat by the military,
or the mafia penetrating governments,

754
01:58:05,488 --> 01:58:07,125
aren't they all your clients?

755
01:58:07,657 --> 01:58:11,833
Or lasers and all those
super-bacteria,

756
01:58:12,036 --> 01:58:16,426
all that filth, kept for the time being
in safes?

757
01:58:16,624 --> 01:58:19,388
Will you please stop this
sociological diarrhea?

758
01:58:19,752 --> 01:58:21,804
Can you really believe
in all those fairy tales?

759
01:58:22,005 --> 01:58:26,596
Not in the good ones, no!
But in the bad ones, certainly!

760
01:58:26,884 --> 01:58:28,605
Come on!

761
01:58:28,970 --> 01:58:33,894
A human being is not capable
of such hatred or love...

762
01:58:34,892 --> 01:58:37,858
that would extend over
the whole of mankind.

763
01:58:39,063 --> 01:58:42,326
Well, money, a woman,
maybe a desire for revenge,

764
01:58:42,775 --> 01:58:46,323
let my boss be overrun by a car,
that I can understand.

765
01:58:47,196 --> 01:58:50,210
But ruling over the world!
A just society!

766
01:58:50,408 --> 01:58:52,211
God's kingdom on earth!

767
01:58:52,785 --> 01:58:57,709
These are not just wishes,
this is ideology, action, concepts.

768
01:58:59,208 --> 01:59:03,266
Unconscious compassion
is not ready for realization yet.

769
01:59:04,505 --> 01:59:07,353
As a regular
instinctive impulse.

770
01:59:07,800 --> 01:59:11,858
There cannot be happiness
at someone else's expense.

771
01:59:13,097 --> 01:59:14,984
I can see quite clearly now

772
01:59:15,183 --> 01:59:19,940
that you plan to overwhelm
mankind with good deeds.

773
01:59:21,356 --> 01:59:25,413
As for me, I'm not a bit worried
about you or myself,

774
01:59:25,610 --> 01:59:27,911
and least of all about mankind.

775
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:31,665
Because you're not going
to achieve anything.

776
01:59:32,909 --> 01:59:36,622
At best you'll get your Nobel Prize.

777
01:59:38,039 --> 01:59:43,389
Or rather you'll get something
absolutely incongruous,

778
01:59:43,586 --> 01:59:47,643
something you don't even think about.
Something like this telephone...

779
01:59:49,676 --> 01:59:53,899
You dream of one thing,
but you get quite another.

780
01:59:56,099 --> 01:59:57,226
Why did you do that?

781
02:00:12,031 --> 02:00:15,625
Telephone... electricity...

782
02:00:19,580 --> 02:00:22,345
Look, very good sleeping pills.

783
02:00:23,209 --> 02:00:26,673
They don't make ones like that any
longer. Why so many of them here?

784
02:00:31,301 --> 02:00:32,938
Maybe we'd better be going?

785
02:00:34,262 --> 02:00:38,568
It will be dark soon,
difficult to come back.

786
02:00:45,815 --> 02:00:49,528
By the way, it's absolutely clear
to me

787
02:00:49,736 --> 02:00:54,042
that all this poem reciting
and making detours

788
02:00:54,240 --> 02:00:56,744
is just a form of apologizing.

789
02:00:57,035 --> 02:01:03,002
I can understand you.
Difficult childhood, bad environment...

790
02:01:04,500 --> 02:01:10,883
But don't have any illusions,
I'm not going to forgive you.

791
02:01:11,883 --> 02:01:14,102
Will you please stop it,
do me a favor.

792
02:02:06,813 --> 02:02:09,992
Professor, come here, please.

793
02:02:43,725 --> 02:02:47,188
Wait a minute.
Don't be in a hurry.

794
02:02:47,562 --> 02:02:49,614
I'm in no hurry whatsoever.

795
02:03:40,490 --> 02:03:42,542
I know, you're going to get mad.

796
02:03:45,703 --> 02:03:47,755
Anyway, I must tell you...

797
02:03:54,796 --> 02:03:59,470
We are now...
on the threshold...

798
02:04:07,308 --> 02:04:12,148
This is the most important moment
in your life.

799
02:04:15,692 --> 02:04:17,198
You must know that...

800
02:04:19,070 --> 02:04:24,041
Your innermost wishes
will be made real here.

801
02:04:25,994 --> 02:04:31,546
Your most sincere wish!
Born of suffering!

802
02:05:00,862 --> 02:05:02,534
No need to say anything.

803
02:05:06,326 --> 02:05:07,500
You just have to...

804
02:05:10,163 --> 02:05:15,051
concentrate
and try to recall your whole life.

805
02:05:18,338 --> 02:05:23,392
When a man thinks of the past,
he becomes kinder.

806
02:05:24,761 --> 02:05:25,888
And most important...

807
02:06:00,129 --> 02:06:01,138
Most important...

808
02:06:06,386 --> 02:06:07,394
You have to believe!

809
02:06:17,480 --> 02:06:18,738
Now you can go.

810
02:06:24,946 --> 02:06:26,156
Who wants to be the first?

811
02:06:31,828 --> 02:06:32,919
Maybe. you?

812
02:06:35,123 --> 02:06:37,970
Me? No, I don't want to.

813
02:06:39,210 --> 02:06:43,600
I understand, it's not easy,
but it will pass.

814
02:06:45,550 --> 02:06:46,724
I doubt...

815
02:06:48,511 --> 02:06:50,232
that it will pass.

816
02:06:52,056 --> 02:06:55,438
If I begin recalling my life,

817
02:06:57,186 --> 02:06:59,073
it's very unlikely I'll get any kinder.

818
02:07:01,024 --> 02:07:05,780
Besides, don't you feel
how shameful the whole thing is?

819
02:07:23,713 --> 02:07:28,719
Humiliating yourself,
sniveling, praying?

820
02:07:29,802 --> 02:07:32,139
What's so bad in praying?

821
02:07:34,223 --> 02:07:36,275
It's just your pride speaking.

822
02:07:38,061 --> 02:07:43,067
Calm down, you're not ready yet.
It happens quite often.

823
02:07:45,943 --> 02:07:47,367
Maybe, you first?

824
02:07:55,953 --> 02:07:56,962
Yes, me.

825
02:08:08,091 --> 02:08:13,180
We see before us
Professor's new invention!

826
02:08:14,180 --> 02:08:18,142
An appliance exploring human souls!
Soulmeter!

827
02:08:18,810 --> 02:08:20,482
It's only a bomb.

828
02:08:21,646 --> 02:08:22,654
What?

829
02:08:24,857 --> 02:08:25,985
You must be kidding.

830
02:08:26,859 --> 02:08:31,783
No, it's just a bomb.
Twenty kilotons.

831
02:08:33,491 --> 02:08:34,583
What for?

832
02:08:45,461 --> 02:08:49,174
We had it assembled with my friends.

833
02:08:51,301 --> 02:08:55,180
With my former colleagues.

834
02:08:59,392 --> 02:09:03,070
This place will never bring any
happiness to anyone.

835
02:09:07,442 --> 02:09:11,867
But if this thing gets into the wrong
hands...

836
02:09:14,574 --> 02:09:16,626
Though, I'm not sure any more.

837
02:09:18,911 --> 02:09:20,632
We came to the conclusion then...

838
02:09:23,458 --> 02:09:26,008
that we shouldn't destroy the Zone
after all.

839
02:09:27,629 --> 02:09:33,395
Even if it's some miracle,
it's still part of nature,

840
02:09:34,052 --> 02:09:36,520
and therefore, a hope in a sense.

841
02:09:38,723 --> 02:09:43,029
They had hidden that bomb,
and I've found it.

842
02:09:43,353 --> 02:09:45,821
The old building, bunker four.

843
02:09:51,402 --> 02:09:54,784
I guess there must be a principle...

844
02:09:56,449 --> 02:09:58,953
Never do anything
that can't be undone.

845
02:09:59,410 --> 02:10:01,462
I understand everything, I'm not some
maniac.

846
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:11,303
But as long as this plague lies
in the open, accessible to any scum,

847
02:10:14,258 --> 02:10:15,646
I can get no peace, no sleep.

848
02:10:23,935 --> 02:10:27,363
Or maybe, my innermost
won't let me do it?

849
02:10:33,194 --> 02:10:35,958
Poor man, some problem
he's invented for himself.

850
02:10:59,887 --> 02:11:00,896
Give it to me!

851
02:11:16,154 --> 02:11:17,162
Give it to me!

852
02:11:22,577 --> 02:11:24,629
You're a civilized man, aren't you?

853
02:11:32,211 --> 02:11:35,391
- Why? What's the matter with you?
- You, lousy hypocrite...

854
02:11:37,592 --> 02:11:41,815
Why?
What have I done... to you?

855
02:11:42,889 --> 02:11:47,112
He wants to destroy your hope!

856
02:12:10,208 --> 02:12:13,554
That's all people have got left
on this earth!

857
02:12:14,629 --> 02:12:19,268
It's the only place
they can come to,

858
02:12:19,676 --> 02:12:21,562
if there's no hope left for them.

859
02:12:24,347 --> 02:12:25,818
You yourself have come here!

860
02:12:26,975 --> 02:12:29,858
Why destroy hope then?

861
02:12:30,103 --> 02:12:32,155
Shut up!

862
02:12:34,607 --> 02:12:36,826
I can see through you!

863
02:12:38,236 --> 02:12:40,288
You don't give a damn about people!

864
02:12:41,572 --> 02:12:47,172
You just make money,
using our... anguish!

865
02:12:47,370 --> 02:12:48,877
It's not even the money.

866
02:12:49,080 --> 02:12:52,177
You're enjoying yourself here.
You're like God Almighty here.

867
02:12:52,834 --> 02:12:56,630
You, a hypocritical louse, decide
who is to live and who is to die.

868
02:12:57,463 --> 02:12:59,599
He deliberates!

869
02:13:01,175 --> 02:13:05,435
Now I see why you stalkers
never enter the room yourselves.

870
02:13:05,722 --> 02:13:10,894
You revel in all that power,
that mystery, your authority!

871
02:13:11,185 --> 02:13:12,776
What else is there to wish for?

872
02:13:13,146 --> 02:13:16,444
It's not true!
You... you're mistaken.

873
02:13:21,779 --> 02:13:23,749
A stalker must not enter the room.

874
02:13:24,490 --> 02:13:28,453
A stalker must not even enter
the Zone with an ulterior motive.

875
02:13:29,162 --> 02:13:30,882
Remember Porcupine?

876
02:13:33,958 --> 02:13:36,010
Yes, you're right, I'm a louse.

877
02:13:36,210 --> 02:13:39,307
I haven't done any good in this world,
and I can't do any.

878
02:13:41,841 --> 02:13:43,977
I couldn't give anything
even to my wife.

879
02:13:45,345 --> 02:13:49,984
I can't have any friends either.
But don't take mine from me!

880
02:13:50,183 --> 02:13:53,813
They'd already taken everything from
me back there, behind the barbed wire.

881
02:13:58,024 --> 02:14:02,948
So all that's mine is here.
You understand? Here! In the Zone!

882
02:14:04,906 --> 02:14:09,378
My happiness, my freedom,
my self-respect, it's all here!

883
02:14:11,829 --> 02:14:14,926
I bring here people like me,
desperate and tormented.

884
02:14:15,416 --> 02:14:19,260
People who have nothing else
to hope for.

885
02:14:20,630 --> 02:14:22,682
And I can help them!

886
02:14:23,049 --> 02:14:26,561
No one else can help them,
only I, the louse, can!

887
02:14:29,305 --> 02:14:31,939
I'm so happy to be able to help them
that I want to cry.

888
02:14:33,309 --> 02:14:35,445
And that's all.
I don't want anything more.

889
02:14:58,167 --> 02:15:00,007
I don't know. Maybe.

890
02:15:01,087 --> 02:15:03,258
Anyway, excuse me, but...

891
02:15:04,757 --> 02:15:06,264
You're just a God's fool.

892
02:15:08,928 --> 02:15:11,776
You have no idea
what's going on here.

893
02:15:15,893 --> 02:15:18,859
Why do you think Porcupine
hanged himself?

894
02:15:19,439 --> 02:15:22,618
He came to the Zone
with a mercenary motive.

895
02:15:22,817 --> 02:15:25,914
He made his brother die
in the meat mincer because of money.

896
02:15:26,112 --> 02:15:29,209
I know.
But why did he hang himself?

897
02:15:30,116 --> 02:15:33,996
Why didn't he come here again,
not for money, but for his brother?

898
02:15:34,829 --> 02:15:36,881
In way of repenting.

899
02:15:37,498 --> 02:15:41,805
He wanted to... I don't know.
He hanged himself a week later.

900
02:15:42,045 --> 02:15:44,762
Because he realized that
not just any wish comes true here,

901
02:15:45,340 --> 02:15:48,104
but only your innermost wish.

902
02:15:56,476 --> 02:15:58,777
Not what would you holler
at the top of your voice...

903
02:16:07,153 --> 02:16:10,332
Coming true here is
only what's in line with your nature,

904
02:16:10,531 --> 02:16:13,379
with your essence,
of which you know nothing.

905
02:16:13,576 --> 02:16:16,922
But it's there, in you,
directing you all your life.

906
02:16:18,539 --> 02:16:20,841
You didn't understand anything,
Leather Stocking.

907
02:16:21,125 --> 02:16:23,177
It wasn't greed that had done
Porcupine in.

908
02:16:23,378 --> 02:16:26,557
He was crawling in this puddle,
begging to bring his brother back.

909
02:16:27,131 --> 02:16:32,055
But what he got was only money,
and he couldn't get anything else,

910
02:16:33,054 --> 02:16:35,688
because render unto Porcupine
the things that are Porcupine's!

911
02:16:36,683 --> 02:16:40,906
And things like conscience, anguish,
they are just inventions.

912
02:16:41,646 --> 02:16:43,781
He realized that and hanged himself.

913
02:16:48,695 --> 02:16:50,664
I'm not going to your room.

914
02:16:52,573 --> 02:16:56,999
I have no wish to pour my filth
over somebody's head.

915
02:16:57,870 --> 02:16:59,163
Even yours.

916
02:17:00,248 --> 02:17:02,467
And then to put my neck into
the noose, like Porcupine.

917
02:17:03,960 --> 02:17:08,800
I'd rather drink myself to death
in my mansion, in peace and quiet.

918
02:17:11,426 --> 02:17:16,515
You don't understand anything
about human beings, Chingachgook,

919
02:17:17,265 --> 02:17:19,649
if you take to the Zone
people like me.

920
02:17:27,775 --> 02:17:29,033
And something else...

921
02:17:30,987 --> 02:17:34,949
Why do you think that this miracle
really exists?

922
02:17:36,659 --> 02:17:41,298
Who told you that wishes
actually come true here?

923
02:17:43,750 --> 02:17:48,258
Have you seen a single man
who's been made happy here?

924
02:17:49,589 --> 02:17:51,142
Was it Porcupine?

925
02:17:56,262 --> 02:18:01,019
As a matter of fact,
who told you about the Zone,

926
02:18:01,225 --> 02:18:04,405
about Porcupine, about that room?

927
02:18:06,272 --> 02:18:06,949
He did.

928
02:19:12,505 --> 02:19:14,724
Then it makes no sense to me at all.

929
02:19:16,384 --> 02:19:18,519
What's the use coming here?

930
02:20:42,345 --> 02:20:43,437
It's so quiet...

931
02:20:45,473 --> 02:20:46,481
Can you feel it?

932
02:20:52,313 --> 02:20:55,492
What the heck... Why not chuck it all,

933
02:20:57,193 --> 02:21:01,583
take my wife, Monkey,
and move over here.

934
02:21:05,451 --> 02:21:06,460
For good.

935
02:21:09,288 --> 02:21:13,678
There's no one here.
No one can hurt them here.

936
02:25:29,090 --> 02:25:30,347
So you're back.

937
02:25:36,723 --> 02:25:38,609
Where did you get this?

938
02:25:40,226 --> 02:25:43,820
He got attached to me.
I couldn't leave him there.

939
02:26:01,914 --> 02:26:06,755
Well, shall we go?
Monkey is waiting.

940
02:26:11,215 --> 02:26:12,224
Are you coming?

941
02:26:26,939 --> 02:26:29,158
Does any one of you need a dog?

942
02:26:32,236 --> 02:26:34,657
I've got five of them at home.

943
02:26:44,832 --> 02:26:47,466
So you love dogs, don't you?

944
02:26:48,127 --> 02:26:49,171
What?

945
02:26:49,629 --> 02:26:50,970
That's very good.

946
02:26:56,844 --> 02:26:59,146
All right, let's go.

947
02:30:01,904 --> 02:30:03,956
You can't even imagine
how tired I am!

948
02:30:05,992 --> 02:30:07,712
God only knows!

949
02:30:09,829 --> 02:30:14,219
Calling themselves intellectuals,
those writers and scientists!

950
02:30:14,417 --> 02:30:15,425
Don't get so excited.

951
02:30:16,586 --> 02:30:18,306
They don't believe in anything!

952
02:30:19,297 --> 02:30:26,226
They've got the organ with which one
believes atrophied for lack of use.

953
02:30:28,181 --> 02:30:31,527
Stop it. Come on.
Go to bed. Don't lie here...

954
02:30:32,226 --> 02:30:36,486
It's too damp here for you...
You shouldn't lie here.

955
02:30:40,401 --> 02:30:41,160
Take it off.

956
02:31:53,391 --> 02:31:55,111
Oh God, what people...

957
02:31:55,518 --> 02:31:58,864
Calm down, it's not their fault.

958
02:31:59,814 --> 02:32:02,068
You ought to pity them,
not to be angry with them.

959
02:32:02,692 --> 02:32:05,112
Haven't you seen them? They've
got empty eyes.

960
02:32:17,915 --> 02:32:20,763
The only thing
they can think about

961
02:32:21,294 --> 02:32:24,058
is how to sell themselves
not too cheap!

962
02:32:24,339 --> 02:32:26,972
How to get as much as possible
for their every emotional movement!

963
02:32:30,261 --> 02:32:34,651
They know they were “born for
a purpose“, “called upon“!

964
02:32:37,560 --> 02:32:39,233
After all, they live “only once“!

965
02:32:41,606 --> 02:32:44,453
Can people like that
believe in anything?

966
02:32:45,902 --> 02:32:48,452
Stop it, calm down.

967
02:32:49,864 --> 02:32:53,495
Try to sleep, will you?
Go to sleep.

968
02:32:57,622 --> 02:33:03,305
And nobody believes.
Not only those two. Nobody!

969
02:33:04,462 --> 02:33:06,099
Who am I going to take there?

970
02:33:10,468 --> 02:33:11,560
Oh, God...

971
02:33:12,887 --> 02:33:14,180
And what's most awful...

972
02:33:16,975 --> 02:33:18,944
is that no one needs it.

973
02:33:19,143 --> 02:33:23,201
No one needs that room.
And all my efforts are just in vain.

974
02:33:24,232 --> 02:33:27,411
Why do you say that?
Stop it.

975
02:33:34,075 --> 02:33:36,162
I'm not going there with anybody
again.

976
02:33:38,329 --> 02:33:42,920
Do you want me to go with you?

977
02:33:44,460 --> 02:33:45,469
Where?

978
02:33:46,254 --> 02:33:48,757
You think I've got nothing
to ask for?

979
02:33:53,594 --> 02:33:54,472
No...

980
02:33:58,766 --> 02:34:00,059
You can't go there.

981
02:34:00,435 --> 02:34:01,443
Why not?

982
02:34:04,439 --> 02:34:05,447
No, no.

983
02:34:10,778 --> 02:34:14,491
What if it wouldn't work
with you, either?

984
02:34:50,735 --> 02:34:53,832
You know, my mother was against it.

985
02:34:56,032 --> 02:35:00,374
You've probably noticed already
that he's not of this world.

986
02:35:03,623 --> 02:35:05,675
All our neighborhood laughed at him.

987
02:35:06,084 --> 02:35:08,718
He was such a bungler,
he looked so pitiful.

988
02:35:11,339 --> 02:35:14,886
My mother used to say:
“He's a stalker,

989
02:35:15,093 --> 02:35:17,513
he's doomed,
he's an eternal prisoner!

990
02:35:17,720 --> 02:35:21,149
Don't you know what kind of
children the stalkers have?“

991
02:35:21,349 --> 02:35:24,066
And I... I didn't even argue with her.

992
02:35:27,063 --> 02:35:30,694
I knew it all myself,
that he was doomed,

993
02:35:30,900 --> 02:35:35,123
that he was an eternal prisoner,
and about the children.

994
02:35:38,992 --> 02:35:40,664
Only what could I do?

995
02:35:40,868 --> 02:35:43,965
I was sure
I would be happy with him.

996
02:35:46,457 --> 02:35:48,676
Of course, I knew I'd have a lot of
sorrow, too.

997
02:35:50,253 --> 02:35:55,010
But it's better to have
a bitter happiness than...

998
02:35:56,801 --> 02:35:58,557
a gray, dull life.

999
02:36:03,725 --> 02:36:07,106
Perhaps,
I thought it all up later.

1000
02:36:16,779 --> 02:36:20,920
But then he approached me and said:
“Come with me.“

1001
02:36:21,117 --> 02:36:25,874
And I did,
and never regretted it.

1002
02:36:29,876 --> 02:36:31,003
Never.

1003
02:36:34,047 --> 02:36:36,727
We had a lot of sorrow,

1004
02:36:37,091 --> 02:36:39,227
a lot of fear, and a lot of shame.

1005
02:36:39,469 --> 02:36:43,063
But I never regretted it,
and I never envied anyone.

1006
02:36:45,433 --> 02:36:50,783
It's just our fate, our life,
that's how we are.

1007
02:36:56,736 --> 02:37:00,449
And if we haven't had our misfortunes,
we wouldn't have been better off.

1008
02:37:02,116 --> 02:37:03,504
It would have been worse.

1009
02:37:06,371 --> 02:37:11,294
Because in that case, there wouldn't
have been any happiness.

1010
02:37:13,795 --> 02:37:15,634
And there wouldn't have been
any hope.

1011
02:38:07,223 --> 02:38:10,320
I love your eyes, my darling friend,

1012
02:38:11,019 --> 02:38:14,233
Their play, so passionate and
brightning,

1013
02:38:15,648 --> 02:38:18,662
When a sudden stare up you send,

1014
02:38:19,569 --> 02:38:22,286
And like a heaven-blown lightning,

1015
02:38:22,864 --> 02:38:26,162
It'd take in all from end to end.

1016
02:38:27,035 --> 02:38:30,131
But there's more that I admire:

1017
02:38:30,747 --> 02:38:33,677
Your eyes when they're downcast

1018
02:38:34,167 --> 02:38:37,513
In bursts of love-inspired fire,

1019
02:38:37,879 --> 02:38:41,141
And through the eyelash goes fast

1020
02:38:42,050 --> 02:38:48,646
A somber, dull call of desire...

1021
02:41:36,641 --> 02:41:43,700
The End
