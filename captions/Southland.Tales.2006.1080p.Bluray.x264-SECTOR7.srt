<i>Makes me want to give up anal.</i>

156

Anyone who knows
anything of history

157
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:34,178
knows that great social changes

158
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,881

without feminine upheaval.

159

they were a porn star.

163
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,028
Really?

164
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,336
We're a bisexual nation
living in denial,

165
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,342
all because of a bunch of nerds,

166
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:02,176
a bunch of nerds who got off a boat
in the 15th century

167
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:05,342
and decided that sex
was something to be ashamed of.

168
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:08,352
All the Pilgrims did was ruin
the American Indian orgy of freedom.

169
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,125
You been lying to me?

170

From who?

173
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,671

I was just "Krysta. "

177
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:44,051
You know, but then in order

178
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,057
from the 76 other Krystas
in the business,

179

00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:48,982
Wow.

181
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:54,397
Well, it's all about now, 2008,

It's a topical-discussion-
chat-reality show.

186
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,249
Got the pop album, the jewelry,

190
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,027

We think he was kidnapped

Yes.

Yes, except for these.

What's that, smoke?

225
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:18,940
Somehow

00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:20,603
There was somebody in there, too.

This is Fortunio Balducci,

He's been crashing with Fortunio

They hooked up
on some drug binge out in Vegas.

much to the senator's dismay,
and his bitch wife, Nana Mae.

People in Washington
are already whispering.

00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:47,758
Looks like the nervous breakdown
of the century.

247

Too bad it's an election year.

00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:25,214
<i>not to be able to explain it
using the known laws of physics.</i>

310
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,522
Promise me you won't get hurt.

311
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,422
We promise.

312
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:37,792
<i>The Neo-Marxists
had taken a hostage...</i>

313
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,196
<i>a hostage they would use</i>

314
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:43,291
<i>to expose the sins
committed by USIDent.</i>

315
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:12,796
<i>His mission was
to impersonate his twin brother.</i>

316
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:18,332
<i>But his heart
was filled with despair.</i>

317
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:33,979
Officer Roland Taverner.

318
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:35,679
Of course you are.
How you doing, man?

319
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:37,381
When did you get back
from the desert?

320
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:42,426
Don't exactly remember.

321
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:46,730
Oh, that's okay.
That's okay, you're okay.

322
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:48,732
Come on, let's go upstairs,
right over here.

323
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:54,769
This is an epic
Los Angeles crime saga.

324
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:57,207
And you're researching your role.

325
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:59,835
You play a cop.
You want to do a ride-along?

326
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:01,173
Yes, exactly.

327
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:04,807
But I'm also directing the film.
It takes place in the near future.

328
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,282
Right.

329
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:08,410
Scientists are saying
the future's going to be

330
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:11,115
far more futuristic
than they originally predicted.

331
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:16,586
The basic concept is this...

332
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:20,097
I play an LAPD cop
who isn't who he seems.

333
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:25,593
He's a paranoid schizophrenic
who has a supernatural gift.

334
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:28,670
He sees things.

335
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,141
And he senses a change
in the city.

336
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:35,646
Crime suddenly skyrockets
for no apparent reason.

337
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:38,877
The world is coming to an end.

338
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,510
And he's the only one
who can see the truth.

339
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:43,418
What's the truth?

340
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:48,950
My character,

341
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:52,519
he realizes that
the apocalyptic crime rate

342
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,326
is because of global deceleration.

343
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:57,994
The rotation of the Earth
is slowing down

344
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:01,095
at a rate of point zero,

345
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:02,162
zero, zero,

346
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,832
zero, zero, zero,

347
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:05,137
zero...

348
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:09,375
six miles per hour each day,

349
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,975
disrupting the chemical equilibrium
in the human brain,

350
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:17,511
causing very irrational
criminal behavior.

351
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:21,719
How does he stop
the global deceleration?

352
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,353
Oh, he can't stop it.

353
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:26,989
There is no stopping
what can't be stopped.

354
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:28,293
Only God...

355
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,730
can stop it.

356
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:34,067
<i>But The New York Times
said "God is dead. "</i>

357
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:39,542
So in the end, I die
in a very tragic downtown shootout

358
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:42,478
while whispering my theory
to Dr. Muriel Fox,

359
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:45,243
the oceanography disaster specialist.

360
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,114
Astrophysicist!

361
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,853
The oceanography
disaster specialist...

362
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,224
sweetheart.

363
00:24:57,462 --> 00:25:00,158
My character... his name...

364
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,794
is Jericho Kane.

365
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,098
You're going to have
to wear a bulletproof vest.

366
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:15,580
Let me ask you,
what goes through your head

367
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,137
when you sit behind the wheel...

368
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,444
cruising the streets,
digesting humanity?

369
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:25,248
Is it a process of elimination?

370
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:29,054
<i>Each car that passes,
the person inside...</i>

371
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:30,958
<i>are they a mere suspect?</i>

372
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:34,429
<i>Or are we all innocents,</i>

373
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:36,660
<i>our chariots mere chess pieces</i>

374
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:40,535
waiting to be thrown from the gridlock
and into the arms of the wolves?

375
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:45,642
Well, I'd say
we act like concerned citizens.

376
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,508
We look at all the people,
all the cars.

377
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:51,744
We look for any unusual
or erratic behavior.

378
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:56,477
Speed changes or lane changes
that seem unsafe.

379
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,023
Yeah, but don't you think
emotions come into play?

380
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:02,091
Judgment calls,

381
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,652
affected by whatever mood you're in
on that particular day?

382
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:09,225
Emotional responses
based on your past events?

383
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,903
Well, there is one thing.

384
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:16,531
I knew it.

385
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:18,667
I knew it, tell me. Be honest.

386
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:24,445
To be honest...

387
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:27,212
we're just looking out
for the niggers.

388
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:46,228
- The niggers?
- Yeah.

389
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,261
They're everywhere.

390
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,438
- You're joking.
- No, I'm not joking.

391
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,485
I'm just fucking with you, man.

392
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,825
That's a funny joke.

393
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:13,724
Yes! He said "nigger. "

394
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,663
But I don't think he said it
with authority.

395
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:19,033
I didn't believe him as a racist cop.
Fascist, maybe, but not racist.

396
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,501
<i>Ask him about his wife.</i>

397
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:28,443
So what does your wife think
about your new girlfriend?

398
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,014
- My wife?
- Yeah.

399
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:37,421
She cool with the fact that you have
a porn-star girlfriend on the side?

400
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,615
I'm not married.

401
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,885
- You're not?
- No, I'm not.

402
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,926
I could've sworn you were married
to the daughter of a Texas senator,

403
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,056
Senator Bobby Frost.

404
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:49,395
Yeah, well, I'm not.

405
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:52,265
I don't know what you're talking about,
and I don't know who he is.

406
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,804
I don't want to talk about this.

407
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:56,602
Why are you asking questions?
I want to talk about my movie.

408
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,438
Okay. Let's talk about your film.

409
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:01,034
What's it really about?

410
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:10,143
It all hinges
on a top secret experiment.

411
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:13,452
Young couple comes
home from the hospital

412
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,049
with their newborn baby.

413
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:18,186
A week goes by, and the baby still
hasn't produced a bowel movement.

414
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:21,757
Maybe the baby's just constipated.

415
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,323
No, no, no, no.

416
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:25,198
This is a very special baby.

417
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:29,133
This baby processes
energy differently.

418
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:36,609
I haven't had a bowel movement
in six days.

419
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,315
I haven't taken a piss either.

420
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,718
<i>Revelation 11</i>

421
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:51,057
<i>tells the tale of two witnesses
who appear in Jerusalem</i>

422
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:53,620
<i>to speak out
against the sins of mankind.</i>

423
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:57,729
<i>They are eventually killed</i>

424
00:28:57,802 --> 00:28:59,997
<i>by those tormented
by their prophesies.</i>

425
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:07,077
The dude hasn't taken a shit
in a week.

426
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:08,635
When has it ever been in the Bible

427
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:10,578
that you have to have
a bowel movement?

428
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:11,945
It's not written anywhere.

429
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:13,278
It's not written in the Bible,

430
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:16,047
but some things is written,
like, in Mother Nature.

431
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:19,420
All of the animals shit.
Cows shit, Ilamas shit.

432
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:21,322
Do they like it?
Do they want to?

433
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:23,826
If they had a voice,
would they rather not?

434
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:26,261
I think they feel better
after they take a shit.

435
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:28,492
I think they do like it.
My answer's yes.

436
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:30,397
My answer is no.

437
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:33,369
We're never going to agree on this.
We've got to stop arguing.

438
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,269
We have a lot of footage
we've got to shoot.

439
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,467
We've got to get out of here.
Where is Kenny?

440
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:39,510
Oh, look who decided to show up.

441
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:41,738
Dude, you are late.

442
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:43,178
You two don't understand.

443
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:46,445
I mean, the shit is
literally hitting the fan.

444
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:47,746
Whatever, dude.

445
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:50,611
Are we still routing out of USIDent?

446
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:52,212
Yeah, of course.
We never stopped.

447
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:58,722
Ken, he wakes up,
give him an injection right there.

448
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:06,332
<i>- Dude, you are late.

<i>to work as a mole inside of USIDent.</i>

452
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:18,437
Hey, Starla?

453
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,781
Can I get my coat back?

454
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:27,324
Appreciate it.

455
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:31,192

00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:03,558
<i>involving the trafficking
of human fingers.</i>

467
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:04,617
<i>Neo-Marxist cells</i>

468
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,630
<i>are attempting to rig
the upcoming election</i>

469
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,258
<i>using rogue fingerprints
from severed thumbs.</i>

470
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:10,665
Well, Christ Almighty.

471
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:13,492
Lookie here.

472
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:16,698
"Teen horniness is not a crime. "

473
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:18,105
I never said it was.

474
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:20,872
Sir, I'm afraid it gets even worse.

475
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:23,038
Well, how the hell can it get
any worse?

476
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:26,243
We just received this image of Boxer

477
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:31,254
from an unidentified source
calling themselves "Deep Throat Two. "

478
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:33,290
They're transmitting
from a scrambler.

479
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:34,484
We can't trace it.

480
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:36,517
Oh, my God.

481
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:38,425
Well, how about that?
Talk of the devil,

482
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,555
we've got an incoming call
from Deep Throat Two.

483
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:42,964
Who are you,
and what do you want?

484
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:46,197
<i>This is Deep Throat Two.
The bitch is back.</i>

485
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:51,208
And she's got Boxer Santaros
on tape in compromising positions.

486
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:55,271
And how much
do you want for the tape?

487
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:57,337
One million dollars cash

488
00:31:57,415 --> 00:32:00,873
<i>and a yes vote endorsement
by the senator on Proposition 69.</i>

489
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,754
Miss Deep Throat,
this is Senator Bobby Frost.

490
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:08,314
I just saw your little movie.
I think it stinks.

491
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:12,352
<i>Furthermore, we do not
negotiate with terrorists.</i>

492
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,921
And if you think you're going
to get any money out of us,

493
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:17,399
you've got miles to go
before you sleep

494
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:19,732
and miles to go before you sleep.

495
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:25,539
Bitch.

496
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:31,138
All right, no need to panic.
We've always got phase two.

497
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:32,944
Wait, what is phase two?

498
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:34,985
You didn't tell me
there was a phase two.

499
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:38,784
Krysta, no offense to you
and your little career-makeover plan,

500
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:41,416
but we are trying to impact
the outcome of an election.

501
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:44,292
<i>Proposition 69.</i>

502
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:48,227
<i>To Krysta, that number
had one meaning</i>

503
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,891
<i>and one meaning only.</i>

504
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:52,400
<i>To everyone else,</i>

505
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,303
<i>it was a proposition on the ballot
to restrict the powers</i>

506
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:58,809
<i>of the oppressive institution
known as USIDent.</i>

507
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:04,376
<i>My parents died
in the 4th of July attacks.</i>

508
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:06,576
<i>When will we be free of this terror?</i>

509
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,415
<i>Vote no. No!</i>

510
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:14,382
<i>I think the press conference
is over. Thank you.</i>

511
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,384
<i>Always the nerds.</i>

512
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:20,522
<i>And the Supreme Court
are a bunch of assholes that...</i>

513
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:22,828
<i>who the fuck elected them
anyway, right?</i>

514
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,733
<i>I mean, they're a bunch
of supreme shit heads, right?</i>

515
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:29,705
<i>Don't tell me what to do
with my body, you fuckstick, right?</i>

516
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:33,141
<i>I have a question
for the Supreme Court.</i>

517
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:37,409
<i>What happens when
a woman has sex on a flight</i>

518
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:40,883
<i>from London to Los Angeles,</i>

519
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:45,889
<i>then takes the morning-after pill
while flying across the time zone?</i>

520
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:48,714
<i>I don't know.</i>

521
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:50,988
<i>Then it becomes
the morning-before pill.</i>

522
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:52,256
<i>You are a genius.</i>

523
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,798
<i>- Holy shit. That is brilliant.
- Hello. Can't argue with that.</i>

524
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,928
<i>Urban pacification units
arrested a group of individuals</i>

525
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:00,698
<i>tied to the Neo-Marxist movement,</i>

526
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:04,333
<i>fighting to impose restrictions

527
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:06,036
<i>through Proposition 69.</i>

528
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,772
<i>ACLU representatives
joined the protest downtown,</i>

529
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:10,336
<i>where there were more arrests.</i>

530
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:13,350
...and I know what I want.
- We need to stay in the moment...

531
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:14,942
<i>Phase two was now in motion.</i>

532
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:18,817
<i>Dion and Dream were going
to stage their own demise...</i>

533
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:22,653
<i>a desperate attempt
to destroy USIDent.</i>

534
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:28,690
Hit me again, baby.

535
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:36,664
You know, I still don't see
why facial prosthetics are necessary.

536
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,106
That wasn't part of the plan.

537
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:43,011
I told you a million times, genius,
Dion and I are cultural icons.

538
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:46,175
We cannot afford to get recognized
by the camera.

539
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:49,475
Oh, that's right.

540
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:51,886
See, I didn't realize
that your spoken-word poetry

541
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:54,550
had captured the cultural zeitgeist
of the nation, Dream.

542
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:58,026
Yeah, well, at least I'm not
a second-rate comedian, Zora.

543
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,997
Just because it's loud
doesn't mean it's funny.

544
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:05,931
You know, you might want
to watch what you say, bitch.

545
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:09,700
Sometimes a dream can become
a nightmare on the turn of a dime.

546
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,538
Will you two just chill the fuck out?

547
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,237
Go get those squib detonators ready,

548
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:16,177
They're going to be here
in, like, an hour.

549
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:21,713
Hey, Bing, these off-road rollerblades
were a great idea.

550
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,378
Thanks, Zora.

551
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:29,458
<i>There is a fucking firewall
that someone is penetrating.</i>

552
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:31,961
<i>And you know what?
Right now this place is probably wired.</i>

00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:35,192
<i>Grid nine zero two

554
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:40,230
No, no, I told you.

555
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:43,740
I told you, I tried
the goddamn password.

556
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,208
<i>So you did hear me
13 minutes ago?</i>

557
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:47,608
<i>- Yes.
- About the firewall?</i>

558
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:50,112
<i>Give me a password that will work.</i>

559
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:52,012
<i>Fuck her.</i>

560
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:55,280
You know what?
Nana Mae Frost can eat a fucking dick.

561
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,186
Take him down.

562
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:37,653
<i>Kenny, get out of there...</i>

563
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:39,059
No, no.

564
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:50,297
Look, you can't be calling me
five times a day with this.

565
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,466
I'm at work.

566
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:53,500
Yeah, well...

567
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:56,012
Yeah, you know,
cat throw-up doesn't come out.

568
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:00,310
<i>So what the hell is it
you want me to do?</i>

569
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,944
Fire at will.

570
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:13,588
Wake up. Wake up.
You have to wake up now!

571
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:37,787
Where is he?

572
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:39,516
I don't know.

573
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:45,495
Take him down.

574
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,494
He doesn't know who he is.

575
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:50,898
Promise me you'll find him.

576
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:53,163
- I promise.
- Okay, good.

577
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,339
There's a window right up there.
You got to go.

578
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,452
I've had this recurring dream.

579
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:20,579
Tell me about it.

580
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:27,254
I wake up in this dungeon.

581
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:30,767
The walls are made of sand.

582
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:37,332
As I slowly make my way
through this maze,

583
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:39,399
approaching
a light source at the end...

584
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:43,638
guess who's standing there
waiting for me?

585
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:46,472
Who?

586
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:49,115
You.

587
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:01,425
Do you ever feel like there's
a thousand people...

588
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,562
locked inside of you?

589
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,333
Sometimes.

590
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:14,004
But it's your memory
that keeps them glued together.

591
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,780
Keeps all those people from...

592
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,844
fighting one another.

593
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:29,052
Maybe in the end that's all we have.

594
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:34,162
The memory gospel.

595
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,418
Would you excuse me for a second?

596
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,278
Yes.

597
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:07,889
"Here we go
round the prickly pear.

598
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,022
Here we go round the prick... "

599
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:29,638
Meet Dr. Inga Von Westphalen.

600
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:33,339
Charmed, I'm sure.

601
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:38,446
He is a fine specimen,

602
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:41,184
a divine specimen.

603
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:48,992
Whatever happens next
is through no fault of your own.

604
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:53,369
We have read your screenplay.

605
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,769
<i>The Power.</i>

606
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,111
How did you get a copy
of my screenplay?

607
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:16,559
Don't look so scared,
Mr. Santaros.

608
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:17,958
The future...

609
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:23,656
is just like you imagined.

610
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:27,192
This is the way the world ends.

611
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:30,069
Not with a whimper.

612
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:33,906
But with a bang.

613
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:54,060
<i>Grid nine zero four

00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:03,238
Eww, you're doing bathroom detail?

617
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,571

00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:06,905
<i>Pacific Park.</i>

619
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,670
Dude, I'm worried about Starla.

620
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:15,207
She's been on bathroom detail
for 24 straight hours.

621
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:16,843

to let you know

943
01:07:07,556 --> 01:07:10,218
that I am pregnant with your child.

944
01:07:15,998 --> 01:07:17,465
Pregnant? She's pregnant?

945
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:19,091
Yeah, you're gonna be
a granddaddy.

946
01:07:19,168 --> 01:07:22,331
Miss Krysta, did somebody
put you up to this?

947
01:07:24,306 --> 01:07:26,797
Yeah. He did.

948
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:31,242
He paid me to bring Boxer back
from the desert safe and in one piece.

949
01:07:31,313 --> 01:07:33,178
- Baron, Baron.
- No, no.

950
01:07:33,249 --> 01:07:34,238
Is this true?

951
01:07:34,316 --> 01:07:35,305
Preposterous.

952
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:38,376
- Listen to me, would you stop it?
- I'll cut you down, you little shit.

953
01:07:38,454 --> 01:07:40,012
Hey, we're on the same team here.

954
01:07:40,089 --> 01:07:42,489
Baron would not sabotage
the campaign.

955
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:43,991
Who are you going to trust, Bob,

956
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:48,520
a Nobel prize-winning scientist
or a two-bit porn star?

957
01:07:49,098 --> 01:07:50,793
I don't know, Dad.

958
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:52,890
I wouldn't trust him,

959
01:07:52,968 --> 01:07:54,959
because you know
he's been secretly funding

960
01:07:55,037 --> 01:07:56,368
the Neo-Marxist movement.

961
01:07:56,439 --> 01:07:59,272
What? How dare you.

962
01:07:59,341 --> 01:08:04,369
Those clowns know less
about Karl Marx than that Chihuahua.

963
01:08:04,447 --> 01:08:10,317
No, you have been secretly sabotaging
this campaign from the inside out.

964
01:08:10,386 --> 01:08:14,686
You should be very careful
about pointing fingers, Madeline,

965
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:16,486
because I happen to know

966
01:08:16,559 --> 01:08:20,290
that you are pregnant
with Brandt's baby,

967
01:08:20,362 --> 01:08:23,559
and I have the blood tests
to prove it.

968
01:08:23,632 --> 01:08:24,724
Baron.

969
01:08:26,869 --> 01:08:27,858
Baron.

970
01:08:29,171 --> 01:08:31,867
The car is waiting, my child.

971
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:33,499
Not now, mother.

972
01:08:33,576 --> 01:08:36,170
Mr. Takahashi

973
01:08:36,245 --> 01:08:40,477
has accepted
the terms of the deal.

974
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:42,210
We have to deal
with Deep Throat Two.

975
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:43,342
Brandt, you're mine.

976
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,945
I'm not staying in here when
all this stuff is going on,

977
01:08:47,022 --> 01:08:49,718
and Mom is out there,
and she's not in here with us.

978
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:51,384
- Mom's all right.
- I don't like it.

979
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:52,654
It makes me feel anxious.

980
01:08:52,728 --> 01:08:54,423
You will never get reelected.

981
01:09:16,185 --> 01:09:17,812
I love you, Jericho Kane.

982
01:09:41,377 --> 01:09:42,537
Hello?

983
01:09:42,611 --> 01:09:44,340
<i>Jericho?</i>

984
01:09:44,413 --> 01:09:45,641
Yeah.

985
01:09:45,714 --> 01:09:47,511
Go to the base
of the Santa Monica Pier.

986
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:50,609
Through the looking glass
you'll find what you are looking for.

987
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:05,066
"We saw the shadows
of the morning light...

988
01:10:06,135 --> 01:10:09,036
"shadows of the evening sun...

989
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:14,908
until light and shadows were one. "

990
01:10:18,747 --> 01:10:20,840
Go...

991
01:10:20,916 --> 01:10:22,781
before it is too late.

992
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:55,178
This is the wizard,
Baron Von Westphalen.

993
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:57,913
Remove the paladin body
from Utopia Three.

994
01:11:03,325 --> 01:11:05,054
And so it begins.

995
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:26,774
<i>But then Satan
answered the Lord</i>

996
01:11:26,849 --> 01:11:29,909
<i>in his sniveling,
conniving way</i>

997
01:11:29,985 --> 01:11:34,684
<i>and said, "Does Job
fear God for no reason?</i>

998
01:11:34,757 --> 01:11:37,624
<i>"Have you not put
a hedge around him</i>

999
01:11:37,693 --> 01:11:42,426
<i>"and his house and all
that he has on every side?</i>

1000
01:11:42,498 --> 01:11:44,489
<i>"You have blessed the work
of his hand,</i>

1001
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:48,400
<i>"and his possessions
have increased in the land.</i>

1002
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:51,633
<i>"But stretch out your hand</i>

1003
01:11:51,707 --> 01:11:53,937
<i>"and touch all that he has,</i>

1004
01:11:54,009 --> 01:11:57,240
<i>and he will curse you
to your face. "</i>

1005
01:11:59,181 --> 01:12:01,547
<i>The Baron had been
conducing experiments</i>

1006
01:12:01,617 --> 01:12:03,778
<i>on soldiers stationed in Iraq.</i>

1007
01:12:05,054 --> 01:12:09,354
<i>Fluid Karma, the elixir of God...</i>

1008
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:12,156
<i>injected into the neck.</i>

1009
01:12:13,796 --> 01:12:16,094
<i>Only a few of us
made it home alive.</i>

1010
01:12:17,366 --> 01:12:19,732
<i>The Baron claims
that Fluid Karma is safe,</i>

1011
01:12:19,802 --> 01:12:21,235
<i>but he refuses to release</i>

1012
01:12:21,303 --> 01:12:24,295
<i>the environmental impact report
from Utopia Three.</i>

1013
01:12:24,373 --> 01:12:27,103
<i>Why are we being kept in the dark?
What is he hiding?</i>

1014
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:29,576
<i>A deal for the Japanese license
to Fluid Karma</i>

1015
01:12:29,645 --> 01:12:31,613
<i>said to be moments from closing.</i>

1016
01:12:40,622 --> 01:12:42,988
<i>The Baron's quest
for global domination</i>

1017
01:12:43,058 --> 01:12:44,650
<i>was almost complete.</i>

1018
01:12:48,831 --> 01:12:51,994
<i>Negotiations had concluded
with Hideo Takehashi,</i>

1019
01:12:52,067 --> 01:12:53,762
<i>the prime minister of Japan.</i>

1020
01:12:59,241 --> 01:13:02,233
<i>Takehashi was willing
to relinquish one of his fingers</i>

1021
01:13:02,311 --> 01:13:05,007
<i>in exchange for access
to Fluid Karma.</i>

1022
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:35,102
You bastard!

1023
01:13:35,177 --> 01:13:38,806
You said finger, not entire hand.

1024
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:42,942
Clearly your attorneys
didn't read the whole contract.

1025
01:13:43,018 --> 01:13:45,987
It stipulates
a six-inch margin of error

1026
01:13:46,054 --> 01:13:47,646
in the cutting radius.

1027
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:50,419
Contract said finger only.

1028
01:13:51,727 --> 01:13:52,716
Serpentine...

1029
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:58,598
have Mr. Takehashi's hand
bronzed and mounted

1030
01:13:58,667 --> 01:14:01,329
on a cheap wooden plaque.

1031
01:14:07,643 --> 01:14:10,476
<i>Here at home the Southland
continues to sizzle</i>

1032

<i>with record-breaking

1033
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:14,578
<i>in the valleys and the deserts.</i>

<i>Palmdale residents endured

Hey, this guy, he ain't no joke,

1036
01:14:44,746 --> 01:14:47,271
so don't waste his fucking time,
you hear me?

1037
01:14:47,349 --> 01:14:49,909
Martin Kefauver has arrived.

1038
01:15:03,065 --> 01:15:04,327
Is it God?

1039
01:15:05,801 --> 01:15:07,462
It's... it's medicinal.

1040
01:15:14,743 --> 01:15:17,075
Now, dog, I seen...
I seen all your movies.

1041
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:20,572
You're... you're great.

1042
01:15:21,617 --> 01:15:23,016
I know I'm great.

1043
01:15:23,085 --> 01:15:24,712
Tell me something I don't know.

1044
01:15:27,623 --> 01:15:30,592
My dad is your plastic surgeon.

1045
01:15:35,797 --> 01:15:37,560
Murray Kefauver's kid.

1046
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:39,294
Yeah.

1047
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:41,302
- Shit, man, how the hell are you?
- Yeah, dog.

1048
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:42,837
Hey, tell your dad I said hey.

1049
01:15:42,905 --> 01:15:46,033
I mean, tell him... tell him I'm...
I'm going to give him a call.

1050
01:15:46,108 --> 01:15:47,097
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1051
01:15:47,175 --> 01:15:50,804
Yeah, Fallujah.
Shit got fucked up.

1052
01:15:50,879 --> 01:15:52,312
Anyways, hey.

1053
01:15:53,582 --> 01:15:55,243
Let's get down to business.

1054
01:15:56,718 --> 01:15:58,185
What is it?

1055
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:02,880
Straight up Fluid Karma.

1056
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:06,485
Me and my boys been smuggling
this shit out of Utopia.

1057
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:10,157
Look. Green, you dream.

1058
01:16:12,367 --> 01:16:15,530
Blue, in an hour you feel new.

1059
01:16:15,604 --> 01:16:17,299
And you can forget
about mellow yellow

1060
01:16:17,372 --> 01:16:18,839
and agent orange, 'cause, hey...

1061
01:16:20,342 --> 01:16:22,810
I'm giving you blood red.

1062
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:29,042
Do you bleed?

1063
01:16:31,186 --> 01:16:33,086
I said, do you bleed?

1064
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:36,055
Yeah, yeah, dog.

1065
01:16:37,059 --> 01:16:38,993
Then you take the blood train.

1066
01:16:40,562 --> 01:16:42,587
You talk to God

1067
01:16:42,664 --> 01:16:45,690
without even...
without even seeing Him.

1068
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:47,928
You hear His voice,

1069
01:16:48,003 --> 01:16:50,471
and you see His disciples.

1070
01:16:50,539 --> 01:16:52,166
They appear like...

1071
01:16:53,508 --> 01:16:56,341
angels under a sea
of black umbrellas.

1072
01:16:57,879 --> 01:17:00,746
Angels who can see through time.

1073
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:15,354

1107
01:21:50,505 --> 01:21:51,938
Hi, Krysta.

1108
01:21:53,241 --> 01:21:54,265
Zora.

1109
01:21:56,378 --> 01:21:57,367
Come on in.

1110
01:22:04,953 --> 01:22:05,977
Penetrating.

1111
01:22:07,822 --> 01:22:09,153
It's just a suggestion.

1112
01:22:10,492 --> 01:22:12,255
So what do you want?

1113
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:15,091
We're filming my reality webcast
before the party.

1114
01:22:16,164 --> 01:22:17,324
Can I score some drugs?

1115
01:22:20,535 --> 01:22:21,695
Sure you can, kitten.

1116
01:22:29,077 --> 01:22:32,808
<i>Pandora's box had been
left exposed to prying eyes.</i>

1117
01:22:48,863 --> 01:22:50,592
How did you get this?

1118
01:22:55,303 --> 01:22:56,793
Hey, over here.

1119
01:22:57,839 --> 01:22:59,431
What's with the getup?

1120
01:22:59,507 --> 01:23:02,101
I've got the tape
of me and Boxer in my bag.

1121
01:23:02,177 --> 01:23:03,667
And what are you going to do with it?

1122
01:23:04,946 --> 01:23:06,538
I'm thinking of going public with it.

1123
01:23:06,614 --> 01:23:09,583
I mean, fuck it, this could impact
the entire election.

1124
01:23:09,651 --> 01:23:12,142
There's a website
that everyone's talking about.

1125
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:14,085
Someone's routing
outside of USIDent,

1126
01:23:14,155 --> 01:23:16,555
and the government
cannot figure out how to shut it out.

1127
01:23:16,624 --> 01:23:17,613
What's it called?

1128
01:23:17,692 --> 01:23:21,856
Www. usideath. org.

1129
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:24,398
How do I get this to the webmaster?

1130
01:23:24,466 --> 01:23:27,731
Oh, it's the Neo-Marxists. They've
put drop boxes all over the city.

1131
01:23:27,802 --> 01:23:29,633
I think there's one in the poopdeck.

1132
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:32,401
Okay, get Sheena and Deena

1133
01:23:32,474 --> 01:23:34,305
and meet them in Hermosa
with the cameras.

1134
01:23:34,376 --> 01:23:35,365
Let's do this.

1135
01:23:36,478 --> 01:23:39,914
<i>Pilot Abilene is accused

1143
01:24:27,662 --> 01:24:28,651
I need your help.

1144
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,129
I need you to help me
find my brother.

1145
01:24:38,039 --> 01:24:39,028
Okay.

1146
01:24:46,614 --> 01:24:47,808
Put on your seatbelt.

1147
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:57,819
Well, Deep Throat Two,
I presume.

1148
01:25:11,806 --> 01:25:13,569
It's the only copy?

1149
01:25:13,641 --> 01:25:15,836
I don't work in distribution.

1150
01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:18,208
Yes, that's the only copy.

1151
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:21,214
Oh, please, I'd like
to ask you a few questions.

1152
01:25:22,584 --> 01:25:25,417
Go ahead, ask away.

1153
01:25:25,487 --> 01:25:27,284
How do you sleep at night?

1154
01:25:28,289 --> 01:25:30,553
Very well, thank you very much.

1155
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:33,059
That is, until I hear
screams from next door

1156
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:35,824
because USIDent
is raiding my neighbor's house,

1157
01:25:35,897 --> 01:25:37,489
based on false information

1158
01:25:37,565 --> 01:25:40,295
provided by that Orwellian nightmare
your friend endorsed.

1159
01:25:40,368 --> 01:25:43,667
You ever lose someone close to you,
a loved one, in a terrorist attack?

1160
01:25:43,738 --> 01:25:44,727
'Cause I have.

1161
01:25:47,609 --> 01:25:49,975
This may come as a shock to you,
Mr. Smallhouse,

1162
01:25:50,044 --> 01:25:52,638
but I lost two people in Abilene...

1163
01:25:52,714 --> 01:25:54,978
two of my four ex-husbands,
on a fishing trip,

1164
01:25:55,049 --> 01:25:57,176
which they took every year
to bitch about me.

1165
01:26:01,022 --> 01:26:03,149
What are you going to do
with all that free money?

1166
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:06,457
I'm going to distribute
my documentary film,

1167
01:26:06,528 --> 01:26:10,362
help some women in the Middle East
get some more civil liberties.

1168
01:26:11,065 --> 01:26:12,760
Do you know
what those two words mean?

1169
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:14,495
"Civil liberties"?

1170
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:16,898
You ought to write them down.

1171
01:26:16,971 --> 01:26:20,463
You know what? You're going
to go down, Cyndi Pinziki.

1172
01:26:21,643 --> 01:26:23,736
That's right,
I know your real name.

1173
01:26:26,047 --> 01:26:28,845
You know,
I wasn't going to do this,

1174
01:26:28,917 --> 01:26:30,942
but I feel very generous today.

1175
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:33,783
I'm going to leave you
with a little present.

1176
01:26:33,855 --> 01:26:39,122
Wow. I am flattered.
What is it?

1177
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:41,424
- A Taser gun to the balls.
- What?

1178
01:26:44,098 --> 01:26:46,760
You should know that
there's another tape out there,

1179
01:26:46,834 --> 01:26:50,235
a far more incriminating tape
featuring your pal,

1180
01:26:50,305 --> 01:26:51,829
Boxer Santaros,
and a double murder,

1181
01:26:51,906 --> 01:26:53,931
and it's going to cost
a lot more than a million

1182
01:26:54,008 --> 01:26:56,340
to get your hands on that one,

1183
01:26:56,411 --> 01:26:58,675
because when
all is said and done,

1184
01:26:58,746 --> 01:27:01,715
nobody rocks the cock
like Cyndi Pinziki.

1185
01:27:11,626 --> 01:27:13,890
Eat shit, you fucker!

1186
01:27:13,962 --> 01:27:16,294
Whoa, yeah!

1187
01:27:30,345 --> 01:27:32,336
That little bitch, she stole it.

1188
01:27:32,413 --> 01:27:33,402
<i>What?</i>

1189
01:27:33,481 --> 01:27:35,506
Your friend Krysta.

1190
01:27:35,583 --> 01:27:38,108
She stole the tape
for her stupid reality show.

1191
01:27:38,186 --> 01:27:40,245
She's going to go
pranked on with it.

1192
01:27:41,556 --> 01:27:44,548
She probably thinks
it's the footage of her and... - what?

1193
01:27:44,626 --> 01:27:46,992
Oh, eat a dick, Pinziki,
eat a dick!

1194
01:27:48,029 --> 01:27:49,018
What?

1195
01:27:49,097 --> 01:27:51,224
She just told me to eat a dick.

1196
01:27:51,299 --> 01:27:53,199
She's going completely fucking off.

1197
01:28:23,431 --> 01:28:25,865
<i>You think your personal privacy

1198

<i>than protecting

1199
01:28:28,803 --> 01:28:30,065
<i>Well, guess again.</i>

<i>that an underground industry

1206
01:28:49,524 --> 01:28:51,924
<i>One question that the president
did not address</i>

1207
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:54,427
<i>was the rising gas prices

Jericho Kane.

1221
01:30:03,998 --> 01:30:06,432
The information that I've uncovered
could get me killed,

1222
01:30:06,501 --> 01:30:09,061
but it was a risk I was willing to take.

1223
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:13,401
The fate of the world
depends on you, Jericho.

1224
01:30:14,709 --> 01:30:16,142
Yes.

1225
01:30:16,210 --> 01:30:18,269
You must board the MegaZeppelin.

1226
01:30:18,346 --> 01:30:22,680
The secret you are looking for is
hidden in the Baron's private chamber.

1227
01:30:23,251 --> 01:30:24,946
What is the secret?

1228
01:30:25,019 --> 01:30:28,011
There's a dead body
they've retrieved from the desert.

1229
01:30:28,089 --> 01:30:30,922
They found the body in your car.

1230
01:30:37,965 --> 01:30:39,626
Did I kill someone out there?

1231
01:30:42,537 --> 01:30:44,027
They're listening.

1232
01:30:45,106 --> 01:30:46,733
They're watching.

1233
01:30:48,976 --> 01:30:53,310
If you should succeed,
remember me, my love.

1234
01:30:53,381 --> 01:30:55,372
Remember my name.

1235
01:30:57,819 --> 01:30:58,911
I will.

1236
01:31:00,154 --> 01:31:01,143

1238

If you don't let me suck your dick,
I'm going to kill myself.

1239
01:31:17,772 --> 01:31:20,240
W- w... wait.
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

1240

<i>Target locked.</i>

1241
01:31:25,079 --> 01:31:29,413
Take your pants off right now,
or I'm going to pull the trigger.

1242
01:31:38,993 --> 01:31:40,358
Take them off.

1243
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:42,122
Okay.

1244
01:31:43,831 --> 01:31:45,059
Jericho Kane...

1245
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:48,469

1247

We could rent a room at Shutters.
It's my favorite place.

All right, we are trailing

1253
01:32:35,347 --> 01:32:37,577
<i>That is the target.</i>

1254
01:32:58,237 --> 01:33:00,603
There's here car.
Bitch.

1255
01:33:00,672 --> 01:33:03,004
All right, now it's on.
Let's go.

1256
01:33:03,075 --> 01:33:05,873
God, this is
so revolutionary, Krysta.

1257
01:33:05,944 --> 01:33:06,933
We have a Steadicam.

1258
01:33:07,012 --> 01:33:09,606
I know, but when I said Steadicam,
I didn't a My First Steadicam.

1259
01:33:09,681 --> 01:33:11,774
I want a real one,
like a real movie.

1260
01:33:11,850 --> 01:33:15,047
I mean, TV show,
but it's like a movie.

1261
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:18,317
You know,
these kind of new technologies

1262
01:33:18,390 --> 01:33:20,415
are totally changing culture now.

1263
01:33:20,492 --> 01:33:23,120
Yeah, especially now
that everything is digital.

1264
01:33:23,195 --> 01:33:24,628
That sausage makes me hungry.

1265
01:33:34,039 --> 01:33:39,807
Right down there, to the right,
behind the toilet, feed the hole.

1266
01:33:48,854 --> 01:33:50,014
Oh, yeah.

1267
01:33:50,088 --> 01:33:52,079
- Do you see this scene?
- Yeah.

1268
01:33:52,157 --> 01:33:54,489
- It feels good.
- It's hot.

1269
01:34:19,718 --> 01:34:21,618
Sir, those people
are trying to kill me.

1270
01:34:26,458 --> 01:34:27,482
Whoa.

1271
01:34:30,062 --> 01:34:32,292
Get the fuck out of my way,
you bitch.

1272
01:34:32,364 --> 01:34:33,353
Do you know who we are?

1273
01:34:47,546 --> 01:34:49,741
- What's your hurry, bitch?
- Oh, don't you...

1274
01:34:51,149 --> 01:34:53,413
Anybody else
want to take a swing at me?

1275
01:34:55,087 --> 01:34:59,046
Krysta, it's the wrong tape,
you stupid whore.

1276
01:35:00,058 --> 01:35:01,491
Come on and get me, fucks.

1277
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:16,798
Fascist pigs.

1278
01:35:24,616 --> 01:35:25,913
Oh, my God!

1279
01:35:27,419 --> 01:35:28,613
Go, go!

1280
01:35:31,423 --> 01:35:32,754
Why did I buy this car?

1281
01:35:32,824 --> 01:35:33,848
Come on.

1282
01:35:40,265 --> 01:35:43,428
<i>Grid nine zero two

1285
01:35:51,176 --> 01:35:53,303

1286
01:35:53,378 --> 01:35:54,640
Okay, bye.

1287

<i>Fortunio was
on the Baron's payroll all along.</i>

1288

Put him up. Put him up.

1289

Up, up, up.

1292
01:37:28,907 --> 01:37:29,896
Watch it.

1293
01:37:35,313 --> 01:37:37,213
There's no turning back now.

1294
01:37:37,282 --> 01:37:38,749
You're a good friend.

1295

I got drafted, dog.

1318
01:39:17,415 --> 01:39:21,112
I got to go to Iraq,
maybe Syria.

I can't take that shit.

1320

I'd rather put a bullet

Fallujah.

1322

You were in Iraq?

Yo, how'd you get out, dog?

1324

That's none of your business.

1325
01:39:49,114 --> 01:39:52,515
Just try and cross the border
into Mexico.

Yo, I don't have a visa, dog.

There is a path to end all suffering.

01:49:08,873 --> 01:49:11,433
<i>according to what he deserves. "</i>

1407
01:49:15,914 --> 01:49:19,509
Mr. Santaros,
welcome to the Marx Suite.

1408
01:49:20,518 --> 01:49:23,282
Now, Simon says
lower your sidearm, please.

1409
01:49:24,989 --> 01:49:26,980
Are you just deaf
or willfully stupid?

1410
01:49:27,058 --> 01:49:30,084
I told you to lower
that fucking sidearm!

1411
01:49:32,730 --> 01:49:33,822
And there you go.

1412
01:49:35,066 --> 01:49:36,397
Well, come on in.

1413
01:49:42,340 --> 01:49:44,501
<i>They're trying to rig the election.</i>

1414
01:49:44,576 --> 01:49:46,976
California is too close to call.

1415
01:49:47,045 --> 01:49:49,206
All... all right, sweetheart,
whatever you say.

1416
01:49:51,349 --> 01:49:53,249
Why isn't she here?

1417
01:49:54,552 --> 01:49:55,951
She won't leave her post.

1418
01:49:56,020 --> 01:49:58,887
It is time for a surgical strike.

1419
01:50:06,564 --> 01:50:08,964
I can smell you
from down the hall.

1420
01:50:11,703 --> 01:50:13,364
No. Not now, Dennis.

1421
01:50:17,909 --> 01:50:20,400
The Neo-Marxists
have infiltrated USIDent.

1422
01:50:20,478 --> 01:50:22,571
She has to leave there immediately.

1423
01:50:22,647 --> 01:50:24,672
It's okay. She has
everything under control.

1424
01:50:24,749 --> 01:50:26,717
We need to get her out of there.

1425
01:50:26,784 --> 01:50:30,185
<i>There are thousands, probably
tens of thousands of protesters</i>

1426
01:50:30,254 --> 01:50:32,051
<i>all up and down the street</i>

1427
01:50:32,123 --> 01:50:34,717
<i>and spreading out
into the surrounding arteries</i>

1428
01:50:34,792 --> 01:50:36,726
<i>coming in
toward the downtown area.</i>

1429
01:50:36,794 --> 01:50:43,131
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the Treer MegaZeppelin.</i>

1430
01:51:00,785 --> 01:51:05,222
The project was called
Serpentine Dream Theory.

1431
01:51:05,289 --> 01:51:08,417
The Tidal Generator
within Utopia Three

1432
01:51:08,493 --> 01:51:11,985
has achieved
simulated perpetual motion.

1433
01:51:12,063 --> 01:51:14,691
The impact of this achievement

1434
01:51:14,766 --> 01:51:18,099
has slowed the acceleration
of the planet to such a degree

1435
01:51:18,169 --> 01:51:23,072
that certain environmental anomalies
have started to surface.

1436
01:51:23,141 --> 01:51:26,770
One of these anomalies,
discovered earlier this year,

1437
01:51:26,844 --> 01:51:29,745
was a rift in the fourth dimension.

1438
01:51:29,814 --> 01:51:32,112
A rift in the fabric of space-time...

1439
01:51:33,317 --> 01:51:35,080
half a kilometer wide.

1440
01:51:36,454 --> 01:51:38,922
Located on the outskirts
of Lake Mead.

1441
01:51:44,128 --> 01:51:46,926
Yes, Mr. Santaros.

1442
01:51:47,498 --> 01:51:50,956
Just like you imagined
in your screenplay.

1443
01:51:52,403 --> 01:51:53,700
And what did we do

1444
01:51:53,771 --> 01:51:56,569
once we discovered a rift
in the fourth dimension?

1445
01:51:58,676 --> 01:52:00,576
We launched monkeys into it.

1446
01:52:07,418 --> 01:52:10,285
Only a human subject
could survive that jaunt.

1447
01:52:12,623 --> 01:52:14,420
The soul of a monkey

1448
01:52:14,492 --> 01:52:16,824
can't survive
the dimensional threshold.

1449
01:52:18,863 --> 01:52:20,763
So we learned,

1450
01:52:20,832 --> 01:52:23,733
at which point the Baron decided

1451
01:52:23,801 --> 01:52:28,795
that the first human subject
to travel through the rift

1452
01:52:28,873 --> 01:52:31,899
would be a movie star.

1453
01:52:31,976 --> 01:52:33,534
Why me?

1454
01:52:33,611 --> 01:52:36,808
Your celebrity
and your political ties

1455
01:52:36,881 --> 01:52:40,840
proved an irresistible combination.

1456
01:52:42,687 --> 01:52:44,211
As the satellite photos show,

1457
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:47,451
at approximately 10:51 a. M...

1458
01:52:47,525 --> 01:52:51,859
and this is 69 minutes
before you passed through the rift...

1459
01:52:51,929 --> 01:52:54,898
a duplicate Boxer Santaros
appeared.

1460
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:00,562
You traveled 69 minutes
back in time, sir,

1461
01:53:00,638 --> 01:53:03,368
at which point your future self...

1462
01:53:05,176 --> 01:53:08,907
and your past self
confronted one another.

1463
01:53:11,315 --> 01:53:14,341
So I'm my future self.

1464
01:53:15,987 --> 01:53:18,319
And I'm the dude
who traveled through the rift.

1465
01:53:19,323 --> 01:53:24,056
And this is all that's left
of your past self.

1466
01:53:30,802 --> 01:53:35,102
This body, this artifact,

1467
01:53:35,173 --> 01:53:40,543
this dual existence
of a single human soul

1468
01:53:40,611 --> 01:53:44,775
could unlock the secret of creation,
the secret of humankind.

1469
01:53:49,187 --> 01:53:50,449
I don't understand.

1470
01:53:52,490 --> 01:53:55,186
I've never considered
committing suicide.

1471
01:54:02,233 --> 01:54:03,495
I'm a pimp.

1472
01:54:05,636 --> 01:54:08,799
And pimps don't commit suicide.

1473
01:54:10,942 --> 01:54:15,572
We don't know what would happen
if two identical human souls

1474
01:54:15,646 --> 01:54:18,171
and the vessels that they travel in

1475
01:54:18,249 --> 01:54:22,413
were to come into immediate
close contact with one another.

1476
01:54:24,856 --> 01:54:28,553
<i>Indy 103.1... the independent FM.
Fourth of July weekend...</i>

1477
01:54:28,626 --> 01:54:30,218
Where did you get this?

1478
01:54:32,230 --> 01:54:33,720
Pilot Abilene.

1479
01:54:33,898 --> 01:54:35,456
Pilot Abilene?

1480
01:54:37,835 --> 01:54:38,859
Do you bleed?

1481
01:54:51,816 --> 01:54:54,649
<i>You can fly so bloody</i>

1482
01:54:55,720 --> 01:54:58,655
<i>What happened
in Fallujah was an accident.</i>

1483
01:54:58,723 --> 01:55:01,055
<i>They called it friendly fire,</i>

1484
01:55:01,125 --> 01:55:03,457
<i>and Private Taverner
could not forgive himself</i>

1485
01:55:03,527 --> 01:55:05,017
<i>for what he had done to me.</i>

1486
01:55:05,096 --> 01:55:06,757
Yo, dog, where are we headed?

1487
01:55:08,132 --> 01:55:09,599
Somewhere downtown.

1488
01:55:11,903 --> 01:55:13,131
We have to go downtown.

1489
01:55:16,807 --> 01:55:18,104
He's in an ice cream truck.

1490
01:55:21,145 --> 01:55:22,510
Wow, I can feel it.

1491
01:55:26,183 --> 01:55:29,084
<i>There is automatic weapon fire,
we understand,</i>

1492
01:55:29,153 --> 01:55:31,178
<i>down on the ground,

1493
01:55:32,924 --> 01:55:36,121
<i>...the power and the kingdom
of your God...</i>

1494
01:55:42,066 --> 01:55:45,866
Yo, dog, I'm going
to empty out my account...

1495
01:55:46,871 --> 01:55:48,429
take everything I got.

1496
01:55:51,075 --> 01:55:52,269
Neat.

1497
01:55:52,777 --> 01:55:55,211

Yo, dog, it says... it says
"transaction denied," dog.

1505
01:56:25,209 --> 01:56:27,404
Yo, what... what do I do?

1506
01:56:28,713 --> 01:56:31,477
We're going to take
the ATM machine with us to Mexico.

1507
01:56:36,754 --> 01:56:40,485
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please rise for the national anthem.</i>

1508
01:56:40,558 --> 01:56:44,187
<i>I give you Rebekah Del Rio.</i>

<i>O'er the ramparts we watched

1512
01:57:49,527 --> 01:57:55,295
<i>And the rockets'red glare</i>

1513
01:57:55,366 --> 01:58:00,929
<i>The bombs bursting in air</i>

1514
01:58:01,005 --> 01:58:05,772
<i>Gave proof through the night</i>

<i>That our flag was still there</i>

1516

1517

<i>We've got a perimeter breach

1521
01:59:13,010 --> 01:59:15,774
<i>I repeat,
we've got a perimeter breach.</i>

1522
01:59:15,846 --> 01:59:17,245

<i>As you could see
just before we lost the picture,</i>

1526
01:59:26,824 --> 01:59:28,951
<i>a lot of people downtown,
a lot of activity,</i>

1527
01:59:29,026 --> 01:59:30,015
<i>all kinds of problems.</i>

1528
01:59:30,094 --> 01:59:32,255
<i>- Please stay indoors.
- Stay inside.</i>

1529
01:59:32,329 --> 01:59:36,129
<i>And, you know, we're getting
information that the Neo-Marxist...</i>

1530
02:00:09,133 --> 02:00:10,122
You know.

1531
02:00:15,973 --> 02:00:19,568
You know exactly what happened
out in the desert.

1532
02:00:24,582 --> 02:00:27,107
Who did the Baron hire
to kidnap me?

1533
02:00:28,118 --> 02:00:30,848
And who drove me
through the time rift?

1534
02:00:39,296 --> 02:00:41,662
You haven't figured that out yet?

1535
02:00:41,732 --> 02:00:44,132
What is his name?

1536
02:00:46,303 --> 02:00:49,170
Officer Roland Taverner.

1537
02:00:57,348 --> 02:01:01,682
Officer Roland Taverner.
How are you?

1538
02:01:22,940 --> 02:01:24,168
Ice cream truck.

1539
02:01:34,785 --> 02:01:36,480
Teri?

1540
02:01:44,261 --> 02:01:47,287
Teri, you've gone too far.

1541
02:01:47,364 --> 02:01:49,355
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we seem to be having...</i>

1542
02:01:49,433 --> 02:01:50,422
Is he still alive?

1543
02:01:55,806 --> 02:01:57,398
In more ways than one.

1544
02:02:06,016 --> 02:02:10,077
You made sure Taverner
went through the time rift with me.

1545
02:02:11,088 --> 02:02:15,889
Then you hit the SUV
self-destruct trigger, by remote,

1546
02:02:15,959 --> 02:02:17,483
which means...

1547
02:02:18,495 --> 02:02:22,522
I didn't kill myself.

1548
02:02:26,904 --> 02:02:28,394
You're a pimp.

1549
02:02:29,473 --> 02:02:32,374
Pimps don't commit suicide.

1550
02:02:32,443 --> 02:02:33,808
Oh, you got that right.

1551
02:02:34,812 --> 02:02:38,270
And Roland Taverner...
and his twin brother...

1552
02:02:39,283 --> 02:02:42,218
they're the same person,
aren't they?

1553
02:02:45,856 --> 02:02:50,919
Two identical souls
walking the face of the earth,

1554
02:02:50,994 --> 02:02:54,430
coexisting in the same
dominion of chaos.

1555
02:03:03,340 --> 02:03:08,835
What will happen
if they shake hands?

1556
02:03:12,649 --> 02:03:15,083
The fourth dimension
will collapse upon itself.

1557
02:03:17,621 --> 02:03:19,020
You stupid bitch.

1558
02:03:25,462 --> 02:03:28,022
<i>Again, don't be alarmed,
but stay inside.</i>

1559
02:03:34,505 --> 02:03:36,268
The ocean is in control.

1560
02:03:37,374 --> 02:03:40,741
<i>...the rioting continues downtown,
and it's a problem right now</i>

02:03:40,811 --> 02:03:43,075
<i>because it looks like
the crowds are growing.</i>

1562
02:03:43,147 --> 02:03:45,741
<i>Even though we no longer
have contact with our chopper,</i>

1563
02:03:45,816 --> 02:03:48,080
<i>we do understand it was
the Neo-Marxist movement</i>

1564
02:03:48,152 --> 02:03:49,483
<i>that started these riots.</i>

1565
02:03:49,553 --> 02:03:53,319
<i>They're continuing to move
throughout downtown Los Angeles...</i>

1566
02:03:53,390 --> 02:03:56,325
And this is the tower of fire.

1567
02:03:57,795 --> 02:03:59,626
We have to evacuate.

1568
02:03:59,696 --> 02:04:01,687
What in God's name
are you talking about?

1569
02:04:12,209 --> 02:04:14,404
There he is. Let's go.

1570
02:04:17,314 --> 02:04:20,181
<i>We've got automatic weapons fire
at Fourth Street and Hill.</i>

1571
02:04:20,250 --> 02:04:21,877
<i>I think they're already inside.</i>

1572
02:04:21,952 --> 02:04:24,216
<i>Recommend open fire
into the crowd.</i>

1573
02:04:56,820 --> 02:04:57,912
No.

1574
02:05:08,765 --> 02:05:09,959
Run!

1575
02:05:16,640 --> 02:05:18,608
Yo, yo, dog, you all right?

1576
02:05:21,512 --> 02:05:23,002
Well done, soldier.

1577
02:05:36,793 --> 02:05:38,761
Take that target.

1578
02:05:40,664 --> 02:05:42,222
You can't miss.

1579
02:06:00,417 --> 02:06:02,248
Come on, let's go, let's go!

1580
02:06:05,255 --> 02:06:09,055
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Krysta Now,</i>

1581
02:06:09,126 --> 02:06:13,961
<i>Shoshanna Cox,
Sheena Gee, and Deena Score.</i>

1582
02:06:14,031 --> 02:06:18,468
<i>They are
the Memory Gospel Dancers.</i>

1583
02:06:20,170 --> 02:06:22,161
Let's... let's leave right now.

1584
02:06:22,239 --> 02:06:24,230
This guy right here
might never leave.

1585
02:09:05,635 --> 02:09:07,159
It had to be this way.

1586
02:09:08,405 --> 02:09:09,702
I know.

1587
02:10:05,896 --> 02:10:07,386
He's going to die.

1588
02:10:08,632 --> 02:10:10,190
There's nothing
we can do about it?

1589
02:10:11,701 --> 02:10:14,261
Is it some kind of an orgy
or something?

1590
02:10:14,337 --> 02:10:15,565
What the hell's he doing?

1591
02:10:42,299 --> 02:10:46,633
Evacuate the atrium.
Move to the rear of the MegaZeppelin.

1592
02:10:46,703 --> 02:10:47,692
No.

1593
02:10:47,771 --> 02:10:51,138
Everybody, go back to your seats.

1594
02:10:51,208 --> 02:10:53,733
Or I kill myself,
and I swear to God...

1595
02:10:55,545 --> 02:10:56,739
I'll do it.

1596
02:11:02,619 --> 02:11:03,813
We have to let go.

1597
02:11:05,555 --> 02:11:06,613
I can't.

1598
02:11:06,690 --> 02:11:08,419
You have to let me go.

1599
02:11:13,430 --> 02:11:15,762
But the truck will fall,
and we'll both die.

1600
02:11:17,200 --> 02:11:19,498
Let me go,
or I'll pull this fucking trigger!

1601
02:11:19,569 --> 02:11:21,799
- No, you won't.
- I swear to God I'll do it!

1602
02:11:21,872 --> 02:11:22,896
No, you won't.

1603
02:11:48,865 --> 02:11:52,699
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the party is over.</i>

1604
02:11:52,769 --> 02:11:55,431
<i>Have a nice apocalypse.</i>

1605
02:11:58,742 --> 02:12:00,676
Put down the gun.

1606
02:12:07,250 --> 02:12:08,877
This is all in my head.

1607
02:12:08,952 --> 02:12:12,353
I can pull the trigger now
and wake up.

1608
02:12:12,422 --> 02:12:14,822
This whole nightmare
will be over.

1609
02:12:14,891 --> 02:12:19,157
Our mission
is to destroy capitalism.

1610
02:12:20,931 --> 02:12:22,899
Dethrone God.

1611
02:12:24,067 --> 02:12:25,830
Officer Roland Taverner.

1612
02:12:28,238 --> 02:12:29,967
That's who you want.

1613
02:12:33,243 --> 02:12:34,972
Don't you remember, Ronald?

1614
02:12:38,081 --> 02:12:39,548
Do you remember Fallujah?

1615
02:12:42,385 --> 02:12:43,818
I remember everything.

1616
02:13:09,212 --> 02:13:13,546
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the way the world ends.</i>

1617
02:13:15,719 --> 02:13:18,654
<i>Not with a whimper,
but with a bang.</i>

1618
02:13:24,694 --> 02:13:25,854
<i>But there is hope.</i>

1619
02:13:25,929 --> 02:13:31,026
<i>In the end we can be reassured
by one undeniable truth.</i>

1620
02:13:31,101 --> 02:13:34,730
<i>Nobody rocks the cock
like Krysta Now.</i>

1621
02:13:37,273 --> 02:13:38,934
<i>And I mean nobody.</i>

1622
02:13:40,276 --> 02:13:43,643
I knew that son of a bitch was crazy.
Get me out of here.

1623
02:14:54,184 --> 02:14:55,378
It wasn't our fault.

1624
02:14:59,522 --> 02:15:00,750
It wasn't our fault.

1625
02:15:04,227 --> 02:15:05,421
Friendly fire.

1626
02:15:06,796 --> 02:15:08,320
I forgive you.

1627
02:15:08,398 --> 02:15:10,559
Friendly fire.

1628
02:15:10,633 --> 02:15:12,362
- I forgive you.
- Friendly fire.

1629
02:15:12,435 --> 02:15:13,834
- Friendly fire.
- I forgive you.

1630
02:15:13,903 --> 02:15:16,098
- Friendly fire.
- I forgive you.

1631
02:15:17,974 --> 02:15:19,100
I forgive you.

1632
02:15:21,177 --> 02:15:22,371
I forgive you.

1633
02:15:23,379 --> 02:15:24,971
<i>Revelation 21...</i>

1634
02:15:26,349 --> 02:15:29,318
<i>And God wiped away
the tears from his eyes,</i>

1635
02:15:29,385 --> 02:15:32,877
<i>so the new messiah could see
out to the New Jerusalem.</i>

1636
02:15:34,324 --> 02:15:36,884
<i>His name was
Officer Roland Taverner</i>

1637
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:39,155
<i>of Hermosa Beach, California...</i>

1638
02:15:42,298 --> 02:15:44,232
<i>my best friend.</i>

1639
02:15:51,908 --> 02:15:53,102
<i>He is a pimp...</i>

1640
02:15:54,110 --> 02:15:59,173
<i>and pimps don't commit suicide.</i>
